We are expecting the focus today to be on government response and initiatives to support vulnerable Canadians through the COVID-19 pandemi
We will also, though, of course take you to Nova Scotia this hour and throughout the day for some of what you might call the careful and safe tributes in this time of COVID-19 to those who were killed in that violent rampage over the weeken
We know now of at least 20 victims, 18 of them have been confirme
Two more presumed to be dead by their son and we'll also bring you the latest on the investigation toda
Those numbers, of course, could vary because police are still looking at some 16 crime scene
I will tell you that is the actual sky behind me in Ottawa right no
So a fairly grim and bleak day here in the nation's capita
But let me show you where we are waiting to hear from the Prime Minister, of course, outside of his home here at Rideau cottag
The regular backdrop for his addres
Before we get there, though, I do want to turn this story back to Nova Scotia where so many people are still reeling from events that unfolded over the weeken
and as police, the RCMP, continue their extensive investigation there toda
Larry Harrison is the member of the provincial legislature for the riding of  and he joins me no
Good to see you, larry, and My condolences to your community and all of Nova Scoti

**Rosemary**:
How are you doing?how are the people around you doing today?



I THINK EVERYONE IS JUST GETTING MOTIONALLY DRAINED.THIS IS JUST A HORRIFIC SITUATION.AND TRYING TO RESPOND TO IT.IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT IS OUT OF OUR NORMAL.IT'S MAKING IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT.I MEAN, OUR NORMAL IS -- SURE.GO AHEA


**Rosemary**:
No, you go ahead,  Your normal is you all get together and help one anothe


EXACTLY.YOU WALK IN A HOUSE, GIVE SOMEONE A HUG, SIT DOWN, HOLD THEIR HAND, TALK TO THEM AND ASK WHAT CAN BE DONE.AND IN A FEW DAYS' TIME, WE GET TOGETHER AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO HONOUR THE PERSON THAT DIED AND NOW THAT IS GONE SO WE NEED TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS NOW TO RESPOND TO THIS HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC LEVEL OF GRIE


**Rosemary**:
Yea
It does make it so much more difficult, the fact that everyone has to be apart during thi
How are people, the families, the people that you've spoken to, how are they dealing with it given that they have sort of this double, you know, pressure now of not being able to be together?



YEAH.WELL, THEY'VE BEEN DOING A FEW THINGS.THERE IS THE VIRTUAL MEMORIAL SERVICE SET UP FOR FRIDAY EVENING.LAST NIGHT THEY PUT CANDLES IN THE WINDOWS.ON POLES, THERE ARE BROKEN HEARTS THAT ARE PUT UP.I WAS JUST TALKING TO MY DAUGHTER A FEW MINUTES AGO.AND SHE'S DIRECTOR OF HOSPICE IN TRURO.AND THEY HAVE COUNCILLORS SET UP AND, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEM SPECIALIZES IN CHILD GRIEF.AND SHE IS DEALING NOW WITH SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT WERE A PART OF THIS.AND THE STORIES ARE JUST HEARTBREAKING.THEY'RE JUST HEARTBREAKIN


**Rosemary**:
The fact that it happened over such a large territory, right?a number of different villages were hit and a number of different familie
How much more difficult is that?the fact that it really seems to have touched so many people in the region?



OH, IT WILL.I MEAN, THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT ARE AFFECTED AND THE FRIENDS AND ANOTHER PART OF THAT ARE THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY CARE AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.THEY'RE ALL -- THEY'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND THINGS TO GET THROUGH THIS.BUT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE BIT, IT IS GOING TO BE A STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE'LL BE DOING THINGS THAT ARE NOT NORMAL FOR US.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS.THIS IS STILL IN A STATE OF SHOCK RIGHT NOW.IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS AND MOST OF US CANNOT, CANNOT, GET OUR HEADS AND HEART AROUND THE AMOUNT OF DEVASTATION THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAS PUT ON U


**Rosemary**:
We now know, I think 18 of the victims,  did you know any of them or their families?



YES, I DID.I KNEW ONE.I KNEW LISA McCULLY.THE SCHOOLTEACHER.AND, AGAIN, THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE WISH WE HAD AROUND FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS.SHE WAS VERY CARING, COMPASSIONATE, FUNNY, POSITIVE IN ALL SITUATIONS.GREAT TEACHER.AND HER RAISING TWO SONS OF HER OWN AT 10 AND 12.SHE JUST -- THAT KIND OF A PERSON WE REALLY NEED AND TO HAVE HER AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS TAKEN AWAY FROM US THIS WAY IS REALLY TRAGIC.REALLY TRAGI


**Rosemary**:
Larry, I want to ask you a more serious question about some of the response and it is really around the emergency alert notic
I ask you that because the RCMP decided to send out tweets instead of issuing the alert that would have gone off on everyone's phone
There is one person who says that that would have made a difference, they think, to one of their friend
is that something you'll want some answers to going forward as a politician, as an 



WELL, I'M -- I'M SURE THAT IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE, WE'RE GOING TO LEARN FROM IT.[SIRENS]THERE ARE GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET.MAYBE THE RESPONSE COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT, I DON'T KNOW.BUT WHAT  -- BUT WHERE I'M GOING TO PUT ALL MY ENERGY NOW -- IF NOT THERE -- BUT ALL MY ENERGY WILL BE GOING TO THOSE WHO HAVE SURVIVED THIS.BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SO MUCH TIME AND SO MUCH CARE AND I THINK THAT IS WHERE MOST OF OUR ENERGY, AS A PROVINCE, REALLY NEEDS TO GO AT THIS TIM


**Rosemary**:
I get that 
How long have you been an ML For the region?



IN MY EIGHTH YEAR NO


**Rosemary**:
and have you ever had to try and comfort or lead people through anything like this?



NOT LIKE THIS, NO.I MEAN, I WAS A CLERGIMAN FOR 41 YEARS AND I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS.BUT NOTHING ON THIS LEVEL.HOPEFULLY NEVER AGAI


**Rosemary**:

I KNOW YOU WILL.AND THANK YOU VERY MUC


**Rosemary**:
Appreciate i
That is Larry  a member of Nova Scotia's legislature and he joins us us from shortt's lak
O
We'll turn back to what we have come to the usual part of our da
If anything is usual these day
But it is the regular update from the Prime Minister that we do expect at this tim
Some sort of normalcy and routine, I guess, is provided by tha
and also by the help of My colleagues here in  the cbc's David  and the host of "power & politics", Vassy  We'll talk about what to expect from the Prime Minister today because while yesterday was very much focused on Nova Scotia, and I imagine he'll have a little more to say on that today, potentially, he is also in the midst, of course, of putting together a government response to fight the pandemic and we do expect him to talk about places and things that might have gotten left ou
and I'll start with 



**Vassy**:
Yeah,  As you mentioned, yesterday the focus was squarely on Nova Scotia in the Prime Minister's response, in his remarks yesterday, just offering condolences and some more details today will pivot back to the government's response to the spread of COVID-19 and primarily the economic response of the government on two facet
The first, charitie
We have seen a number of charitable organisations come forward and say they are really finding things to be difficult right now because of their inability to fund rais
Obviously with so many people at home and unable to work and relying on government relief at this point, they don't have a lot to give to charitie
They had asked for a stabilization fund in the neighbourhood of $10 billio
My understanding is that what is announced today won't necessarily be that muc
I'm not sure of the exact figur
But that will be sort of a chunk of change for charities, specifically aimed at supplementing the money that they have lost due to a lack of fundraisin
The second aspect, the second facet of what I'm expecting from the Prime Minister has to do with that other huge government relief package for businesses around wage six  subsidie
The government has passed legislation with opposition part is a few weeks acing to provide a wage subsidy for businesses of any size, of 75% of the first I think is nearly $5
000 of an employee's salar
That is in the -- the application process is startin
It will be starting in a few weeks is My understandin
Although that is always a moving target as wel
Today will be an announcement around opening up sort of a process by which employers can figure out how much they can expect to ge
So, sort of an online mechanism for doing so because that is something that we heard from a number of employers, a number of business owners who plan to access i
They're still very kind of vague on the detail
Vague on how fast that money will com
They needed it yesterday kind of thing and how much they might be entitled t
My understanding is that there is some information on that today as wel


**Rosemary**:
The finance Minister says that they will provide information around application
and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think charities can also tap into the wage subsidy programme so that might be part of the aid, but obviously there is more comin


**Reporter**:
Yea
They can tap into the wage subsidy and they can include and exclude the government grants they were getting and make it as accessible in popula
In particular, what we'll see today with the aid for charities is we were told what would be to support vulnerable population
The Prime Minister, in particular on  I believe, it was, referenced the disabled and people with disabilities and also seniors as particular segments of the population that have the vulnerabilities to which they are exposed has been laid bare by this pandemic and sort of foreshadowing the need to help ther
and the charitable sector could very well be a vehicle to provide that ai
and, you know, there's a couple of other things that we're hoping to hear from the Prime Minister toda
There is a growing problem in Canada's food supply sector in terms of meat plants, for exampl
Where there are outbreaks of COVID-19 amongst the workforc
It doesn't necessarily make the food unsafe, just makes the workplace unsafe for peopl
Which makes it hard to process the meat and backs up the food supply chain and creates all kinds of economic ripple effects and supply problems coming into the grocery stores and also the last I checked the price of oil, it was up $7 to -$
So, this is a massive problem for three provinces in particular -- being Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrado
and just on top of everything else that everybody is suffering with the slowdown in the economy, there is that double whammy of oi
While we're looking at probably a u-shaped economic recovery with a long period of time at the bottom, restaurants, if they survive can re-open, movie theatres can re-open, toy stores can re-ope
We don't really know what's going to happen with the oil sector after all of this, because there's a lot of other structures at play ther
It could be something that the Prime Minister is asked about, given the total shock in the markets in the last 24, 48 hour


**Rosemary**:
I'll get Vassy to weigh in on that, to
I will say that the meat packing plant you are talking about is the car gill plant in Albert
and there are 484 cases now linked to that plan


**Reporter**:
and that is one-third of the country's capacity, just that one plant is one-third of the processing capacity in the countr


**Rosemary**:
and another example of that occurring, too, in the United State
So, that is a real concern, as you say, for suppl
and I imagine, you know, some being that people have to think abou
Because those are close working quarters and obviously that is a large part of the people working there that had been affecte
 maybe I'll goat you as we wait for the Prime Minister to weigh in on the oil piece of thi
Because it is, you know, shocking to see numbers in the negatives like tha
and to try to understand how any industry could rebound from those numbers and the pandemi


**Vassy**:
Yea
and it is crazy,  that less than a week ago we were sitting here talk about the aid package that the federal government was announcing for the sector based on numbers that already looked terrible and just in the last 24 hours as David and you both point out got a whole lot wors
Specifically that benchmark price for US oil, at least the contracts for may is concerne
They are a bit better in  But there is so much instabilit
The reserves right now are so high, the storage capacity is full pretty much all ove
We saw that price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia take place that really deflated prices below what they were thanks to a huge increase in deman
and that agreement that was reached about supply a few weeks ago ended up basically doing nothing for oil price
Now we see them even lowe
The package that was announced last week from the federal government was around cleaning up oil well
It was worth about $2 billion, if you include the credit as wel
But they are considering -- finance Minister bill  said last week supplying credit in some wa
I don't know the specifics yet, they have not announced them, to bigger companie
Oil companies need around $40 per barrel to cover their cost
We eve seen a huge amount of capital projects delayed in the oil patch right no
We're seeing troubles in the United States as wel
The president is talk about subsidizing the industry to some degree saying he won't let them fail so it's almost as if this crisis which seemed like last week couldn't get any worse is getting wors
The ask of the federal government is going to increas
You know, they will be expected to provide some details on what they're going to do, if they're going to do anythin
But there is -- I mean, the need is as acute as it gets right now and it affects not just Alberta, not just Saskatchewan, but Newfoundland and Labrador, to
Albeit in a bit of a different wa
All three provinces are hurtin
Their revenues are hurting and the federal government's revenues, I should say, are also really affected by the price of oil, to


**Rosemary**:
The difference is they have more capacity and take on debt than we've seen obviously in  certainl
All righ
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada emerging from his home to speak with us yet again about his government's response to the COVID-19 pandemi
Let's listen i
