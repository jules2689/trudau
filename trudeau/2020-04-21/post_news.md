We're going to pull away from the federal briefing.
If you want to continue watching, go to our website.
I'll bring in David Cochrane to help us wrap that up. I will say, I take little glimmers of optimism where I can get them and Dr. Tam did say "wehave prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada as we've seen in other parts of the world".as we get to maybe the second phase of this, whatever that might bring, that is encouragingnews.
Over to you on what you wanted to talk about.



**Reporter**:
I think we're getting more clarity on the questions that were ran by Andrew scheer, the conservative leader, but planes coming back from china empty.
and gotten a statement from the Minister of public services and procurement on what happened.
Two planes did come back from shanghai without their lead of P.P.E. Gear they were sent to get.
One was a federal government run.
One was undisclosed provincial government run.
We don't know which provincial government this was.
What happened they were caught up in congestion on the ground.
The planes were able to get in, but the trucks carrying the supplies couldn't get from the warehouse to the tarmac to load things on in the landing and takeoff window given to these Canadians planes.
I should point out that four planes did arrive over the weekend, carrying full loads of P.P.E. This is an ongoing problem at this airport because essentiallyevery country in the world is looking for the same thing coming out of the same country.
a lot relying on the same airport.
I heard there was backlogs of trucks trying to get in the airport more than 20 hours long.
