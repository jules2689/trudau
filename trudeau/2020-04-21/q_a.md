Good mornin
With respect to the wage subsidy, I gather that it will be fob apply starting  but can you tell us,  Trudeau, when companies that apply will actually receive money in order to pay their employees?the reality is that during this crisis, people need hel
Almost immediatel
and we need to be able to deliver that help as quickly as possibl
We realised that the wage subsidy was going to take a bit of time to be delivered and we're still working on tha
As you say, people will start to be able to apply on monday and we do hope that we can get the money to them quickly after tha
It will take a number of days at the very leas
That is why we wanded  make sure that businesses, small businesses and corporations, would have access to credit in order to get through these time
The money is comin
The online calculator will also allow companies to see exactly how much money they will be receiving from the government in the coming weeks and, therefore, they can make the necessary -- do the necessary borrowing no


**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We recognize the need for support as quickly as possible and that is why we're working extremely hard to get help out to peopl
We started with the Canada emergency response benefit, which is now helped over $8 million people across this country and made a significant differenc
But we also want people to get the -- we want other people to get the emergency wage subsidy, which means working with businesses to keep people on the payroll through this so that they cannot only retain a job, but have a job to get back quickly to as soon as the economy picks up agai
We have announced that on  people will be able to register for this onlin
As of today, however, they can see what the amount they're sleekly to be able to get through this and be confident in their ability to access credit from banks, from agencies like BC and  to be able to support people right now in this time of nee
We're moving as quickly as we ca
We move very quickly on the Canada emergency response benefi
We hope to be able to get this help out to businesses, to keep employees on the payroll as quickly as possibl

**Interpreter**:
M
Trudeau, quickly, what does that mean?will it go as quickly as the CERB  the wage subsidy or should we expect that it could take longer or perhaps a week or two weeks before the money starts to circulate?the Minister will have more to say about that in a couple of hours, but I can tell you that people at the Canada revenue agency are working hard right now to deliver that money to businesses as quick will I as possible after the registratio
Now it will take a bit of time, but people should know that they will be geting that  and should not hesitate to access credit from banks and our other institutions like BDC and DC

Next question, charlie   Line ope


**Reporter**:
Good morning, Prime Ministe
Bill Blair said he intends to introduce striker gun laws as soon as possible and you said your government was on the verge o
Passing a ba
Will a gun control bill be introduced in the restricted version of parliament that we see during the pandemic or will have it to wait until parliament returns to normal sits?



Ing >> Prime Minister  obviously, we're all reeling from the tragedy in Nova Scotia and our focus right now is on supporting those families as quickly as possible and, as well as we possibly ca
On gun control legislation, we made strong commitments to move forward with that rapidl
As you mentioned, we were on the verge of bringing it in before parliament was suspended through COVID-19 and we're now looking at the right way and the right moment to bring it forwar
The tragedy in Nova Scotia simply reinforces an underlines how important it is for us to continue to move forward on strengthening gun control in this country and we will do that at the appropriate time.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
The tragedy in Nova Scotia makes it clear just how important it is to continue to move forward with gun contro
We made commitments to move quickly on this and we were on the verge o
Introducing new measures to restrict assault-type weapons in Canada before parliament was suspended because of COVID-19 and now we are looking at what the right time will be to reintroduce that bil
But we will take necessary time to ensure we do things properl


**Reporter**:
So which of your government's promised gun control measures will it be that it introduces first?the assault rifle ban or something else perhaps influenced by what happened over the weeken


**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
The legislation on the assault rifle ban was ready -- almost ready to go when we -- when the parliament suspende
So I expect that will be the first measures that we bring forwar
Of course, as we learn more about this terrible, terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, we will keep reflecting on ways that we need to help Canadians stay safe in their communities and their homes and across the countr


THANK YOU.ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE PHONE, PLEASE, OPERATO

**Reporter**:
  Trudeau.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
I'd like to come back to a question you were asked yesterday during the question per in the house about three planes that were to come back to Canada full of medical equipment from  chin
and that came back empt
Can you tell us more about that?I received more information about tha
There was one plane that was supposed to be bringing in equipment for Canad
Another was bringing in equipment for a specific province that hay had ordered and there are very strict limits on how much these chinese  are allowed to stay in Canada and there are huge delays when it comes to bringing in the equipment from the airpor
Unfortunately the planes haed  take off without having received their carg
But we continue to work tirelessly to deliver that equipmen
We received a great deal of equipment in recent day
We are expecting more equipment in the coming days and up until now, we have been able to respond to the province's need every step of the wa
Although I understand it's difficult for people to hear that when they are working in our health care syste
But we will continue to ensure that we deliver all the necessary equipment to the


**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
I got more information on the issue around the two planes that landed empty yesterda
One was a government of Canada charte
The other was chartered by a specific province for one of their order
There are severe restrictions in china over how long a plane can stay in their airports before having to leave, whether it's full or no
Shipments to the airports are difficult and interrupted by checkpoints and quarantine measure
For the most part, we've been able to navigate through those and make sure that Canada gets the equipment that it need
But those two airlines were forced to take off quickl
We will continue to ensure that, as we have been, we make sure that Canadians get -- Canadian provinces and *ins -- institutions get the equipment that they so desperately nee
We're continuing to receive millions of pieces of POE Over the past day
We expect many more over the next days and week
As well as the Canadian industrial facilities tooling up their ability to deliver POE S.it's always a challenge to get the PPE  Canada in a time where the global market is very, very competitive for thes
But we have managed so far to get the equipment the provinces have asked for and we will continue to make sure we're prioritizing support for our frontline  who are going into battle every day against this viru

**Interpreter**:
So what happened to that equipment,  Trudeau?is it still in our possession in storage somewhere or -- and what is the other province expecting this equipment?well, we will continue to follow up on the orders that were placed and ensure we receive the equipment we need and we will continue to ensure that we have chartered plane there is to pick up the equipment we requir
With respect to the province, I will let the province share that information with yo


**Reporter**:
I want to ask you a question on behalf of nick Beaton who lost his wife Kristen in the senseless violence in Nova Scotia this weeken
He just spoke with our chief ancho
His wife Kristen die
She was a front line worker, a dedicated nurse and was also pregnant and she was forced to reuse her personal protective equipment because there was not enoug
So on behalf of nick, let me ask you this question -- why aren't there enough POE S for nurses and other health care workers not only in Nova Scotia, but across the country and where is the supply chain broken and what are we going to do about it?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
First of all to nick and all the families going through a heart wrenching loss right now looking for answers, looking for reasons, looking for suppor
We are there for yo
We will be there for yo
Like so many people across the country who are worried about what the next days will bring and the challenges we're facing, our front line workers have been worried about the continued availability of personal protection equipmen
We've seen a number of provinces talk about the shortages a number of days awa
We've managed to cover those but we are in a situation where people are trying to stretch out our POE As long as possibl
Different provinces are managing their stockpiles differentl
The federal government is there to support provinces in their requests and until this point have been -- up to this point and beyond this point have been able to respond to the specific requests the provinces have mad
At the same time, we have been this a competitive and international environment where everyone is looking for  which is why we made significant investments in domestic capacity to make the equipment that keeps can front line health workers safe across the countr


**Interpreter**:
First of all, I want to express My deepest condolences to nick and all those who lost loved ones because of this terrible tragedy in Nova Scoti
This is something that people are having a hard time understanding and we want you to know that we will be there for all the families suffering at this tim
Now with respect to our health care workers who are concerned about having the necessary protective equipment, the provinces are responsible for managing their protocols and their equipment and, as a government, we will bawls there and have always been there to respond to any requests from the provinces for PP 
Now we heard provinces say a couple of times well we're three days  I from being completely out of this piece of equipment or that piece of equipment, but every single time we avoided shortages and provinces were able to extend the availability of their protective equipmen
But we're working very hard at the national and international level in an environment that's become extremely competitive in terms of getting that perform PE up until now, we have succeeded in filling all the necessary orders from the provinces and we realised that we had to develop a domestic capacity to produce that equipmen
and that is why I'm so pleased to be seeing all of those Canadian companies that have stepped up to produce the necessary equipment and that equipment will be available very soo


**Reporter**:
You've been able to deliver personal protective equipment to provinces that need it but is the supply chain broken if a pregnant nurse has to reuse masks and gloves?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
These are decisions that are taken by provinces and how they extend and how they require the use of POE Different provinces have different burn rates in terms of use of POE We have worked as a federal government to ensure that when provinces have made requests of us for more personal protective equipment, we've been able to deliver what was neede
These are things we're fighting for every single day and want everyone to have the equipment they nee


**Interpreter**:
The provinces make their own decisions with respect to their health care syste
and the use of personal protective equipmen
Our responsibility as the federal government is to be there to support the provinces and be able to help meet their needs and, thus far, in most cases, we've been able to meet those need
But, of course, we must continue to do everything we ca


**Reporter**:
Prime Minister, when you were talking about the gun control legislation, you brought up the tragedy in Nova Scoti
I wanted to know if you've been briefed on what kind of gun or guns were used in Nova Scoti
Do we know that they were legal and, based on that, how would your proposed gun control legislation have potentially prevented the shooting?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
There is still a tremendous investigation going on by the RCMP right no
Many, many different sites and different questions that a lot of people have and I'm going to trust the RCMP on releasing information as they feel it is important t


**Reporter**:
With regards to the gun control, why are you joining the two?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We have gun control legislation ready to move forward o
We were ready -- almost ready to move forward on it a number of weeks ag
We continue to see it as a priorit
We had every intention and have every intention of continuing to move forward on it when things restore to orde
It did not need or take this tragedy for us to be committed to gun contro
We've long been committed to i
This is just another tragic reminder of the fact that we need to do more to keep Canadians saf


**Reporter**:
As a follow-up, on the world health organization, ireland  it would quadruple funding for the WHO and australia and the rick and -- and the UK are calling for an independent investigation of the handing of the crisi
Are we going to be calling for an investigation?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We have been increasing our contribution to the WHO In order to deal with this pandemi
We fund them to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a yea
At the same  we do need to find answers to how this happened so we unction how to ensure that it never happens again and that is certainly something Canada will be part o


**Reporter**:

**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
We continue to tribute to the world health organizatio
This is an important institution, particularly in pandemics but we will have to get some answers in order to better protect ourselves as a country and as a plane
So that we're better prepared for the next potential pandemi


**Reporter**:
Should Canadians be concerned about the security of their food supply chain and what more can the government do to protect that supply chain?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We heard from Canadian beef producers and associations that the priority will be to ensure suppl
Right now the priority is on domestic suppl
We're not anticipating shortages of beef but prices will go u
At the same time, we know that it is extremely important to do everything we can to keep Canadians safe, to keep workers in all industries across this country essential or not, as safe as we possibly can and I'm pleased to see measures being taken reflected on how to keep people saf


**Interpreter**:
The reality is that a meat processing plant has prioritized deliveries to the Canadian marke
There may be lower exports in that case, but we want to ensure that our supply chain for beef products is functionin
The reality is that there may be higher prices but we'll be monitoring that closel
But the important thing in all of this is to ensure that we're protecting workers in essential and other industrie
Protecting them from COVID-19 and we must take the necessary measures to keep them saf


**Reporter**:
and on oil prices, is there going to be further support for the oil industry and beyond that, for provinces that rely heavily on oil revenues and refinance their debt to recover from this downturn?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
Our focus from the beginning has been on helping Canadians, families, workers across this country and we have put in place a significant measure that has an impact on all industries, including the oil industry with the Canadian emergency response benefit and wage subsidies that have helped thousands of workers across Alberta and the oil sector in this countr
We moved forward on other measures as well to help out that sector specifically and we're always open to working more on helping particular industries or areas that need support to get through this COVID-19 crisi
We'll continue those discussion
On the supporting provinces, we recognize that various provinces are facing real challenges in terms of cash crunches and liquidity and our department of finance are engaged closely with different provinces on challenges that they're facing specificall


**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Now earlier in your speech, you said there was some positive science and I won't Earp what those positive signs are in your opinio
and on the wage subsidy, can you assure us that not $1 of taxpayer money will go to companies that have money in tax havens?well, in terms of encouraging signs, when we look at the pandemic curves and the numbers in terms of spread of COVID-19,  can see that there has been a the decline in the number
Now we see the numbers going up in certain parts of the countr
But there are fewer and fewer cases each day and we hope that what this means is that the measures we've been taking are now helpin
and are now helping the expected outcom
At the same time, we need to keep those measures in place because if we relax them too soon, we could end up in a situation where COVID-19  ramp up again and this is not something we would want to see happe
In terms of our approach in helping businesses, we have always been focused on help for worker
We did not want to judge whether someone working for a small halifax  or for a large internation  chain would be treated differentl
We wanted to ensure that workers and families that depend on that income would have the necessary help and that is why we moved forward with the wage six did and moving forward with the emergency response benefi
I'd like to say that we are always working hard to fight tax havens and tax avoidanc
We have taken very strong measures to try and recover that money and impose serious consequences on companies that take advantage of those tax havens and we'll continue to do tha


**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
As I said a couple of times, I think there is reason for cautious optimis
We're hearing that from mode cal officers across the countr
Noting that the increase in cases is getting smaller every day in many place
That we are still seeing more cases every day, but fewer than in previous days, which is a sign that our efforts are workin
We are continuing to do the right things as a country, that is getting this virus under contro
However, we need to continue to do those things because as soon as we loosen up, if we loosen up too quickly or if we're not careful, we could see a return spike of COVID-19 that would be problematic for citizens and for the economic recover
We'll focus on making sure that we're doing things very, very carefull
But it is encouraging to see the things that Canadians are doing from coast to coast to coast, to help each other out and stay safe are working and that is why we need to continue the


**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Now just to understand with respect to tax havens, you didn't really answer My questio
Can you tell Canadians today that the money that you paid in taxes will not go to companies that have accounts in tax havens?can you assure us of that today or can you not assure us of that today?we are helping workers right across this countr
Someone who works for a company whose family depends on that job and has lost that job needs hel
Needs to be able to pay for groceries or pay ren
It is that reason that we decided to help people, whether it is a small company or big compan
We are helping workers who need that suppor
Now with respect to tax avieed answer,  will continue to fight that sort of actio
and choices made by some companis who  to pay their fair share of taxe
We have invested more than $1 billion in the Canada revenue agency so that we have more tools available to us to target those companie
