Thank you.
Please press star 1 if you have a question.[speaking french][speaking french][voice of interpreter] our first question is from la presse..



So there will be a technical briefing, there are currently sound difficulties.
Our next question is from CBC Jamie strashin.



My question is for Dr. Tam.
Dr. Tam, your counterpart in the United States, Dr. Fauci, talked last week about a road back for professional sports, games played without any fans in the stands.
I'm just wondering, do you think similar thing could happen in Canada?and could I just get your thoughts on the potential returnof professional sports in Canada?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
So right now together with all the chief medical officers of health, we're looking at the next phase, if you like, again stressing extreme caution in how we have to keep going right now with the measures that we have.
We know that population immunity is not going to be high.
So we have to move extremely carefully.
I think we will be looking at all different kinds of communitysettings, activities and providing what -- there has to be a risk-based approach, a riskassessment, and that will include this area.
So -- but I think as some of these innovative thinking is coming together, these are some of the ideas, but again that two-metre distance and ensuring that we don't spread the illnessis extremely important which ever solution people are going to think of. So absolutely, I think every sector should begin some thinking about how innovative they can be in maintaining social distance.
Because we don't have other specific measures to treat or vaccines, so any sort of -- the new normal must take into account stopping the spread of the virus like we have now.
But I think -- the other perspective I have is just engaging the communities and thesectors that are looking at their own specific situations, because public health can't possibly assess every setting.
We can provide guidance as to how you maintain safety and the health of the population and theclients will be people they serve.



Follow-up.



**Reporter**:
Just to be more specific, would you be supportive of games played in Canada before empty stadiums?would that be safe in your estimation?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
I think, together with the other chief medical officers, we'll have to look at what plans there are with the people that are actually going to be potentially in contact with each other.
I think for sure crowded conditions, mass gatherings, is not in any of our near future.
I think that is pretty evident.
As to whether certain activities can be done safely, that needs further assessment.



Thank you, doctor.
The next question, please.



Next question is [speaking french][speaking french][voice of interpreter].



**Reporter**:
Your predictions were that we would have between 1200 and 1600 deaths by today and in fact we're at 1700.
That's the second time your short-term predictions are off.
My question is should we still trust them?and more specifically when you're looking at quÉbec where there are now 54% of all canadian deaths, are you concerned about the situation?is there something quÉbec is doing wrong that would explain the situation?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
So as we've always said modelling is for planning purposes and not there to accurately tell you what the numbers are every single day.
and every single day we relook at those projections, they will change depending on the actual cases reported.
So as I said several days ago, the 24 hours following that, those projections will already have changed.
So I think that is some of the difficulty if you're trying to communicate where we're at. It is in a similar range of the severity.
and it is a reflection of the population that is most impacted right now in many areas of the country and those are the seniors and those who are in long-term care homes.
So absolutely this is a reflection I think of the actualepidemiology of this illness in Canada.
So I think every jurisdiction must do the utmost to enhance infection prevention control in all of those settings, so that's absolutely critical.
I think any model is going to tell you that -- what we're doing right now is going to change the trajectory.
Those models are very sensitive to what we do today in terms of projecting into the short or further down the road.
So, you know, I think everythingmust be done to change the course.
and it is up to everyone who is responding to help do that.



**Reporter**:
Well, as a follow-up, you haven't addressedthe question of quÉbec.
Now that the province which represents roughly 23% of the population has 54% of all deaths.
How do you explain that?and should we start to think that maybe quÉbec is not doing something right?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
I think we do know that many of the cases are linked to long-term care facilities, so I think My answerstays the same.
It's not the only jurisdiction, in fact, many provinces have outbreaks related to facilities, but it is a major challenge in the context of quÉbec.
I know that the -- from a publichealth perspective, they are, you know, escalating and trying to manage that situation.



Thank you, doctor.
One last question on the phone before we turn to the room.



Thank you.
Next question.
La presser



**Reporter**:
[speaking french][voice of interpreter] thank you.
My first question is for Minister duclos.
How will you be calculating the emergency wage subsidy payments for thousands of businesses in the country and how will you do it quickly?



Answer, thank you for this question.
You are very right that these calculations will be rather complex and it is urgent.
We want to help businesses to maintain their employees and rehire them and as quickly as possible.
What we're announcing today is anew calculator being launched on the C.R.A. Website as well as a whole host of information on theC.R.a. Web page, so that employers and businesses will beready to apply a as of april 27. I've had a look at the website myself.
It's complete, it's informative.
It will help businesses to prepare their applications on april 27 and also help businesses make decisions regarding rehiring their employees if they haven't already made these decisions.
The Canada revenue agency has extraordinary employees.
I'm confident that the C.R.A. Will be able to get the paymentsout quickly ah of may 5th.
They will be able to pay out thesubsidies that have been appliedfor.



**Reporter**:
Follow-up question.[end of translation] it's about the mask-wearing policy or instructions.
QuÉbec is working on scenario right now on a new scenario for as far as masks go. I wonder if you're involved in these discussions and if you would make masks mandatory as they have been declared mandatory for air travel?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
I think as work with all the chief medical officers of health, so any recommendations goes towards that table, the special advisory committee and it forms a guidance, a baseline on which jurisdictions will make certain recommendations.
Sure, I think having facial covering if you're not in the health care setting -- we've said you need to preserve actual personal protective equipment for that circumstance.
and masks do not replace all the other important measures that we do know work in terms of physical distancing, hand-washing, hygienic measures, but it does form another layer of protection, which can be applied when you can't maintain that two-metre distance.
So that is -- depending on what setting you're talking about, that is something that definitely can be considered.
In the transportation on a plane, as one can imagine, social distancing would be quitechallenging, which is why that policy was added as well as in our quarantine act when we have now mandatory orders for symptomatic and asymptomatic travellers, isolation and quarantining for the 14 days.
We also now provide a requirement for the wearing of amask as people are transferring to their place of quarantine as well.



Thank you, doctor.
Dr. Njoo.[speaking french][voice of interpreter] I would like this repeat the answer in french.
Dr. Tam and I are working very closely with our counterparts, the chief medical officers of the provinces and territories.
Together, we sit on a special advisory committee.
Yesterday Dr. Arruda, the chief medical officer of quÉbec said something that is in line with what Dr. Tam and I have been saying.
Wearing a nonmedical mask can protect others, but it does not replace proven public health measures such as practising physical distancing, practising hand hygiene, and all other hygiene measures.
However, in some settings it is not possible to physical distance.
For example, when taking public transit or when grocery shopping.
So those are situations in whichwe can wear a nonmedical mask.
We must make sure to preserve masks for those who work on the front lines in our health care system.



The question for the health Minister, but perhaps Minister Freeland or Dr. Tam.
Kristen Beaton was one of the victims in the Nova Scotia shooting and was a front line health care worker providing continuing care.
Her husband told news this morning before the tragedy struck the family, they were already living under quite a great deal of stress.
She was coming home and very terrified she would pass on something to her children and family because she was reusing protective equipment because there was a shortage in Nova Scotia.
There was not enough for her and her colleagues.
What do you say to the Beaton family and other front line health care workers when you hear stories like that, that there is not enough P.P.E. To goaround?



First of all, obviously, My heart is with Mr. Beaton in this terrible time of loss.
I can't even imagine how hard Otis and difficult it is for him as he loses his wife and soon-to-be child as I understand.
On the issue of personal protective equipment, I will tell you that the federal government has been supporting provinces and territories to procure equipment as you know over the course of the outbreak and pandemic.
We've managed to work very well with provinces and territories to fulfill their requests for support around personal protective equipment and other medical devices.
As you have heard us say many times, it's been a very challenging thing to do in the time of the global pandemic where supply chains are disrupted, where all countries are scrambling to boost their capacity to produce P.P.E., including Canada.
I will also say that I know the provinces have been working to ensure they're distributing P.P.E. To the hospitals and carefacilities.
and I will say to Mr. Beaton, we all have to redouble our efforts so there aren't stories of people who have to reuse masks.
There are a number of creative ideas that have come from partners around the sterilization of masks.
We have approved companies in Canada that can do that.
There will be more domestic production and capacity.
But what it reminds all of us who are the ones trying to facilitate this national response is that we can leave no stone unturned.
Not at the local level, not at the provincial level and not at the federal level.



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:
is there anything more that can be done in terms of providing greater supplies to personal protective equipment and also thinking about the federal government's role in testing as some provinces, namely Ontario, are having a difficult time meeting the goals they put out for testing and the importance that will come into play, so for P.P.E. and testing, the federal role?



Well, we all have our eye on testing.
It will definitely be part of the strategy that Dr. Tam is working through with her colleagues on the next steps in terms of as we emerge from the first wave of illness.
Certainly at the federal level, we have tools that we can support the provinces and territories with and we have been.
Namely, that is financial resources.
That is product.
and in this case, in testing, it's approval of testing capacity and the equipment that goes.
Reagent and the chemicals that produce react and the ability to manufacture that reagent.
Dr. Tam works on that guidance with her counterparts and it is constantly under review and being renewed as we ramp up our capacity and understand better how to really get a good sense of what is happening in the country.
I will say, again, and this is similar answer, we can all do better.
We can all do more.
I know that various provinces and territories have struggled with their capacity to test and we are always there to support them whether it's people, whether it's financial resources or equipment.
We'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the particular barriers are in their case, in terms of their limitations and work to provide solutions to alleviate those limitations.



Thank you, Minister.



Julie van dusen, CBC The United States estimates will need 300, 000 people to do contact-tracing.
How many will Canada need?and how is that training going so far?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
So contact-tracing is pretty much an everyday job for local and provincial public health authorities as well.
So they are thinking this through.
One area we stressed we need to make sure that enough capacity to contact-tracing.
and we have offered that support.
There is a number of volunteers and people who signed through a portal in terms of people who can help.
So provinces can draw on those rosters in terms of support for contact-tracing.
But the numbers are up to individual, even the health authority at the local level, tofigure out how much they need and to let us know if they need anything else, but I know that the whole public health system knows that contact-tracing is going to be very important as welook towards that next phase.



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:
I'll add, it is extremely important we understand the investments we make in public health, both from a prevention perspective and a public health perspective are critical to the next steps of whether you call it reopening the economy or moving forward in terms of recovering from the pandemic.
That if we don't have local health capacity we'll be hindered in our abilities.
We have that conversation with provinces and territories at the health Minister table.
It is very important we continue to redouble our efforts to support public health.
and I think Dr. Tam is completely accurate when she says that public health is local.
That this is something that happens at the municipal level.
That is often funded provincially, but facilitated at the local level in partnership with municipalities.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:
Contact-tracingis something we're all focused on. I'll add one thing.
I had a good conversation with premier ford this morning.
We talked about the significant progress that Ontario has made in testing and the big difference that is making.
and we also talked about contact-tracing and how essential, as your question underscores, julie, how essential contact-tracing is today and also going forward.
and we talked about being very good at communicating with each other and being sure that if there is anything that Ontario needs to terms of support on contact-tracing, we will all be ready to provide it.



Okay.
Great.



**Reporter**:
The next question is about the meat-packing plants.
I'm not sure if it's for patty hajdu.
I'm not sure.
We know the union sounded the alarm a week ago when there was 38 cases, now there is 484.
Somebody dropped the ball.
Who is going to make sure these places are safe to work in?and who can tell us if the meat packed in these COVID-19-filled plants is safe to eat?



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:
I'll start with the overview and then turn to Dr. Tam because she's been involved in the meat packing plant outbreaks and other fa facilities.
It's critical important that every sector realize and back to earlier comments, that every sector realize they are going to have to extremely thoughtful about the measures they take and put into place to protect their employees because it's not just a matter of a nice thing to do, it's an essential component to ensuring their industry remains strong and able to continue to provide the services or the goods that they -- that they provide.
We obviously support industry as well as public sectors in responses and public health agency of Canada is and has been working on guidance for a variety of different essential workers and we're very concerned about outbreaks in the food supply chain.
Obviously, this has a critical importance, not just to the industry, but to the many Canadians along that chain, but also the Canadians that ultimately end up being consumers of the products that farmers are producing.
So we have our eye on this very closely right now.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam to talk about the details of that particular plant.



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
I think the outbreak investigation is very much in the jurisdiction of the province and Alberta and I know that My counterpart is working very hard with the local health authorities.
So I think we're always there to support if they need extra support whether it's epidemiologists or others, but they're managing the investigation of this outbreak.
and what I will point out is that it's not just the workplace, but also, of course, the social environment of the workers making sure that they have the support they need to keep themselves safe and reduce transmission in the home settings as well as the work settings.
I think the details of exactly what happened in terms of the transmission, I think the Alberta chief medical officer will have a much greater detail.
I know that the risk is not Justin the plant itself, but is more perhaps in the families and the households and those contacts.
So I think that is really important to clarify.
I think all essential workplaces must have the necessary protocols, administered protocols, physical and environmental adjustments and, as needed, whether they need masks or personal protective equipment or others that the workers might need should they not be able to physical distance or observe some of the other public health measures.
So I think those are some of the key aspects.
Of course, we provide the guidance that I think the implementation is never as easy as one sort of has on a piece ofpaper.
