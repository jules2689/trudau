**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
[speaking french].hello, everyone.
I want to begin by noting the innocent men, women and children systematically murder by the nazis.
We also pay tribute to the brave itself and resiliency of survivors and all those who risked their lives to save others during the holocaust.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
First of all, I'd like to say that this is holocaust remembrance day.
Today we remember the six million men and women who were systematically murdered by the Nazis paying frill to the courage and resilience of the survivors and all those who risked their lives to save others during the holocaust.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
This morning, I want to again extend My most sincere condolences to the friends and families of the victims of terrible Nova Scotia attacks.
Since yesterday, I've had a chance to speak with constable chad Morrison the RCMP officer who was wounded as well as constable Heidi stevenson's family.
On behalf of all Canadians, I thanked them for their service and their sacrifice.
Yesterday, when I offered My sympathies to the RCMP officers who support me, I was amazed to see how many of them knew Heidi and had incredibly fond memories of her and worked with her on the musical ride.
They remembered her as an extraordinary person and it really goes to show just how tightly knit not just the RCMP is as a force, but how close we are as a country.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Yesterday, I had a chance to mention to the RCMP officers with me that I wanted to extend My condolences to them and I was very happy to hear about their stories about her.
They served on the musical ride with her and told me what an extraordinary person she was.
and that made me realise that it is not only about the RCMP being family and connected can, but all of us as Canadians being connected.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
The Canadian police and peace officers memorial on parliament hill to pay tribute to constable Stevenson and recognize the contributions of all law enforcement members to keep us safe.
I also spoke to a number of colleagues from Nova Scotia, both past and present, and sought Senator Sam kutcher's advice.
These calls all reinforce what had we know about Nova Scotia -- that it's a special place where people stick together and look out for each other.
This week, we are all nova scotian.
The families and friends can count on the unwavering support of their neighbours and of every single canadian.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
It's now been a number of weeks that we've been asking everyone to follow experts' destroys protect your health and the health of others.
The lock down t social and physical distancing are an adjustment for most of us. But for some, the consequences of the pandemic are far more profound than a simple adjustment.
The virus has had the effect of worsening the inequalities that already exist in our society.
The most vulnerable, seniors and young homeless or people without jobs or single-parent families.
Many are all particularly affected by Covid at the same time, the total number of people who need help to get through this difficult period has also gone up. Woel before the pandemic upset our lives, charities were there for our communities.
I'm thinking of P.E.I. Royal in park extension that helps young people at risk or an organization in st. Michele.
In Papineau, as across the country, community organisations are an essential resource for the most vulnerable and their mission in this pandemic does not change.
But they need more support in order to help a large number of people.
and expanding clientele.
So, the government is putting in place the emergency fund for community support today.
This will be an envelope of $350 million to support community organisations and nonprofit organisations.
Part of the money will go directly to small independent organisations and the rest will go through the national organization like the united way and the red cross.
This is money our community leaders will be able to use to train volunteers or increase deliveries at home for the seniors or provide transportation services for people with a disability.
With this fund, we are giving organisations more resources to adjust to the current realities and difficulties associated with COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
Charities and nonprofit organisations were doing crucial work to help our communities.
Their mission has always been to support people in their time of need and that hasn't changed.
But COVID-19 is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on those organisations because more people need help.
Back in march, one united way partner in Winnipeg made and distracted 1475 emergency kits for families, seniors and homeless people in just five days.
They had to change services because of the rules that everyone has to follow to keep each other safe.
Here in Ottawa there are a number of organisations focused on serving isolated seniors.
Usually they have day programme where seniors can socialize, participate in activities, eat well and maintain a connection to their community.
That is no longer possible because of COVID-19 so organisations are now delivering meals and providing support via phone.
In Toronto Tropicana community services is now helping vulnerable youth access their COVID-19 benefits.
It takes resources to make these adjust.
S, resources these groups don't have because they're spread so thin trying to help as many people as possible.
So to support charities and nonprofits in their important work, our government is setting up a $350 million emergency community support fund.
a portion of these funds will go directly to smaller, independent front line organisations and the rest will flow through national organisations like the united way community foundations Canada and the red cross that can get funds to local organisations and vulnerable people quickly.
This is money for things like training volunteers, increasing at-home deliveries for seniors or driving people with disabilities to appointments.
With this fund, we're giving more resources to charities and nonprofits so they can adapt to the new realities and difficulties brought on by this pandemic.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Our government has introduce add three-point plan to protect jobs and help people who have lost their jobs as well as support small businesses that are having cash flow problems.
and today, I have other news with respect to the emergency wage subsidy that gives eligible employers up to $847 per week per employee to allow them to keep them on the payroll.
We are launching a calculator on the C.R.A. Website that will allow businesses to determine exactly what the wage subsidy will cover.
Companies will be able to apply starting next Monday April 27. Later today, the president of the treasury board will provide additional details with respect to the deployment of this programme.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
is also helping business owners and entrepreneurs adapt to a new reality with the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
This new measure gives qualifying employers up to $847 per employee each week so they can keep people on the payroll.
Today we're launching a new calculator on the C.R.A. Website so businesses can determine the amount they can expect to claim through the wage subsidy.
Employers will be able to apply, as of this monday, april 27. Later today, the Minister will be providing more details regarding the roll out of this programme.
I want to turn now to some encouraging news on the innovation front.
Our supercluster initiative brings together small, medium-sized and large companies, academic institutions and not-for-profit organizations to generate bold ideas and innovate.
So a few weeks ago, the digital technology supercluster challenged its network of over 500 firms to come up with solutions to help Canadians get through this pandemic.
They received over 300 submissions and they are now moving forward on a number of key projects.
Toronto's DNA Stack is developing a new cloud-based network that allows researchers who are looking to improve our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19 to share their findings.
Another company, foodex, is working with its partners to develop an e-grocery management system to make sure our health care workers, seniors and others have access to fresh food dhurg crisis.-- during this crisis.
Canadian innovators are among the best in the world and it is great to see so many of them use their talents to help our communities.
This is yet another example of what we can achieve when we work together as team Canada.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
This week, and in the coming weeks, you can count on us to continue to find other ways to help you.
We will continue to do our part just like you continue to do yours.
It's been almost six weeks that you've been at home, that you've been regularly washing your hands and that you've been keeping a two-metre distance from others.
a month and a half is a long time.
But your efforts are now bearing fruit.
We're seeing early signs, but positive signs, that we're moving in the right direction and this is in large part thanks to you.
So let's all continue to follow the experts' advice anding to we will get there.



**THANK YOU, PRIME MINISTER.WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR QUESTIONS.ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW-UP.OVER TO YOU, OPERATOR.OPERATOR**:
Thank you.
Merci.
First question, Kristy kirkup, the "globe and mail".line.
Open.



**Reporter**:
Good morning, Prime Minister.
How will you help millions of Canadians who find themselves without medical benefits during a global pandemic?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We know that the way we get through this particular crisis is by pulling together and making sure those who are most vulnerable get the support theyey particular crisis is by pulling together and making sure those who are most vulnerable get the support they need.
It is key to being able to recover quickly once we're through this pandemic.
That is why we continue to work with partners across the country, to highlight gaps and challenges and things we need to do more to help people.
We will continue to work with partners to make sure we're getting that help out there.
Ok.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
We know that, in the midst of this pandemic, there are many people who are suffering and who need help and that is why we have put in place new measures that will help many, many people.
But we also recognize that there are other people who need more help and that is why we're working with our partners, with people across the country and other levels of government to help people get through these difficult times so that we can come back very strong once this pandemic is over.



**Reporter**:
Millions of Canadians are finding themselves without medical benefits because they have been laid off and Dr. Eric Hoskins says that Ottawa could cover the cost of the provinces and territories, bringing Canadians into their formularies as an interim step to help.
is this something your government is willing to do?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We're going to continue to work with all sorts of experts and smart folks making recommendations from across the country in different ways to make sure that we're doing everything we need to help Canadians through this crisis.
We've always -- we're always looking for more things to do and will continue to do the things that need to be done in order to help Canadians.



Thank you.
Next question, operator.



**OPERATOR**:
Thank you.
Merci.[speaking french].



**Reporter**:
Bonjour.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Good morning.
With respect to the wage subsidy, I gather that it will be fob apply starting Monday but can you tell us, Mr. Trudeau, when companies that apply will actually receive money in order to pay their employees?the reality is that during this crisis, people need help.
Almost immediately.
and we need to be able to deliver that help as quickly as possible.
We realised that the wage subsidy was going to take a bit of time to be delivered and we're still working on that.
As you say, people will start to be able to apply on monday and we do hope that we can get the money to them quickly after that.
It will take a number of days at the very least.
That is why we wanded to make sure that businesses, small businesses and corporations, would have access to credit in order to get through these times.
The money is coming.
The online calculator will also allow companies to see exactly how much money they will be receiving from the government in the coming weeks and, therefore, they can make the necessary -- do the necessary borrowing now.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We recognize the need for support as quickly as possible and that is why we're working extremely hard to get help out to people.
We started with the Canada emergency response benefit, which is now helped over $8 million people across this country and made a significant difference.
But we also want people to get the -- we want other people to get the emergency wage subsidy, which means working with businesses to keep people on the payroll through this so that they cannot only retain a job, but have a job to get back quickly to as soon as the economy picks up again.
We have announced that on Monday people will be able to register for this online.
As of today, however, they can see what the amount they're likely to be able to get through this and be confident in their ability to access credit from banks, from agencies like b. D.c. and EDC, to be able to support people right now in this time of need.
We're moving as quickly as we can.
We move very quickly on the Canada emergency response benefit.
We hope to be able to get this help out to businesses, to keep employees on the payroll as quickly as possible.



**Interpreter**:
Follow-up?



**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Mr. Trudeau, quickly, what does that mean?will it go as quickly as the CERB for the wage subsidy or should we expect that it could take longer or perhaps a week or two weeks before the money starts to circulate?the Minister will have more to say about that in a couple of hours, but I can tell you that people at the Canada revenue agency are working hard right now to deliver that money to businesses as quick will I as possible after the registration.
Now it will take a bit of time, but people should know that they will be geting that money and should not hesitate to access credit from banks and our other institutions like b. D.c. and EDC



Thank you.
Merci.



**Operator**:
Next question, charlie Pinkerton ipolitics.
Line open.



**Reporter**:
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Bill Blair said he intends to introduce stricter gun laws as soon as possible and you said your government was on the verge of. Passing a ban.
Will a gun control bill be introduced in the restricted version of parliament that we see during the pandemic or will have it to wait until parliament returns to normal sits?



Ing >> Prime Minister Trudeau obviously, we're all reeling from the tragedy in Nova Scotia and our focus right now is on supporting those families as quickly as possible and, as well as we possibly can.
On gun control legislation, we made strong commitments to move forward with that rapidly.
As you mentioned, we were on the verge of bringing it in before parliament was suspended through COVID-19 and we're now looking at the right way and the right moment to bring it forward.
The tragedy in Nova Scotia simply reinforces an underlines how important it is for us to continue to move forward on strengthening gun control in this country and we will do that at the appropriate time.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
The tragedy in Nova Scotia makes it clear just how important it is to continue to move forward with gun control.
We made commitments to move quickly on this and we were on the verge of. Introducing new measures to restrict assault-type weapons in Canada before parliament was suspended because of COVID-19 and now we are looking at what the right time will be to reintroduce that bill.
But we will take necessary time to ensure we do things properly.



**Reporter**:
So which of your government's promised gun control measures will it be that it introduces first?the assault rifle ban or something else perhaps influenced by what happened over the weekend.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
The legislation on the assault rifle ban was ready -- almost ready to go when we -- when the parliament suspended.
So I expect that will be the first measures that we bring forward.
Of course, as we learn more about this terrible, terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, we will keep reflecting on ways that we need to help Canadians stay safe in their communities and their homes and across the country.



Thank you.
One more question on the phone, please, operator.



**Operator**:
Thank you.
Merci.[speaking french] la presse.



**Reporter**:
Bonjour, Mr. Trudeau.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
I'd like to come back to a question you were asked yesterday during the question per in the house about three planes that were to come back to Canada full of medical equipment from China.-- china.
and that came back empty.
Can you tell us more about that?I received more information about that.
There was one plane that was supposed to be bringing in equipment for Canada.
Another was bringing in equipment for a specific province that hay had ordered and there are very strict limits on how much these chinese aircraft are allowed to stay in Canada and there are huge delays when it comes to bringing in the equipment from the airport.
Unfortunately the planes haed to take off without having received their cargo.
But we continue to work tirelessly to deliver that equipment.
We received a great deal of equipment in recent days.
We are expecting more equipment in the coming days and up until now, we have been able to respond to the province's need every step of the way.
Although I understand it's difficult for people to hear that when they are working in our health care system.
But we will continue to ensure that we deliver all the necessary equipment to them.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
I got more information on the issue around the two planes that landed empty yesterday.
One was a government of Canada charter.
The other was chartered by a specific province for one of their orders.
There are severe restrictions in china over how long a plane can stay in their airports before having to leave, whether it's full or not.
Shipments to the airports are difficult and interrupted by checkpoints and quarantine measures.
For the most part, we've been able to navigate through those and make sure that Canada gets the equipment that it needs.
But those two airlines were forced to take off quickly.
We will continue to ensure that, as we have been, we make sure that Canadians get -- Canadian provinces and *ins -- institutions get the equipment that they so desperately need.
We're continuing to receive millions of pieces of P.P.E. Over the past days.
We expect many more over the next days and weeks.
As well as the canadian industrial facilities tooling up their ability to deliver P.P.E. S.it's always a challenge to get the P.P.E. Into Canada in a time where the global market is very, very competitive for these.
But we have managed so far to get the equipment the provinces have asked for and we will continue to make sure we're prioritizing support for our frontline workers who are going into battle every day against this virus.



**Interpreter**:
Follow-up?



**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
So what happened to that equipment, Mr. Trudeau?is it still in our possession in storage somewhere or -- and what is the other province expecting this equipment?well, we will continue to follow up on the orders that were placed and ensure we receive the equipment we need and we will continue to ensure that we have chartered plane there is to pick up the equipment we require.
With respect to the province, I will let the province share that information with you.



**Reporter**:
I want to ask you a question on behalf of nick Beaton who lost his wife Kristen in the senseless violence in Nova Scotia this weekend.
He just spoke with our chief anchor.
His wife Kristen died.
She was a front line worker, a dedicated nurse and was also pregnant and she was forced to reuse her personal protective equipment because there was not enough.
So on behalf of nick, let me ask you this question -- why aren't there enough P.P.E. S for nurses and other health care workers not only in Nova Scotia, but across the country and where is the supply chain broken and what are we going to do about it?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
First of all to nick and all the families going through a heart wrenching loss right now looking for answers, looking for reasons, looking for support.
We are there for you.
We will be there for you.
Like so many people across the country who are worried about what the next days will bring and the challenges we're facing, our front line workers have been worried about the continued availability of personal protection equipment.
We've seen a number of provinces talk about the shortages a number of days away.
We've managed to cover those but we are in a situation where people are trying to stretch out our P.P.E. As long as possible.
Different provinces are managing their stockpiles differently.
The federal government is there to support provinces in their requests and until this point have been -- up to this point and beyond this point have been able to respond to the specific requests the provinces have made.
At the same time, we have been this a competitive and international environment where everyone is looking for P.P.E., which is why we made significant investments in domestic capacity to make the equipment that keeps can frontline health workers safe across the country.



**Interpreter**:
First of all, I want to express My deepest condolences to nick and all those who lost loved ones because of this terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia.
This is something that people are having a hard time understanding and we want you to know that we will be there for all the families suffering at this time.
Now with respect to our health care workers who are concerned about having the necessary protective equipment, the provinces are responsible for managing their protocols and their equipment and, as a government, we will bawls there and have always been there to respond to any requests from the provinces for p. P. e. Now we heard provinces say a couple of times well we're three days Aida I from being completely out of this piece of equipment or that piece of equipment, but every single time we avoided shortages and provinces were able to extend the availability of their protective equipment.
But we're working very hard at the national and international level in an environment that's become extremely competitive in terms of getting that perform p. E. up until now, we have succeeded in filling all the necessary orders from the provinces and we realised that we had to develop a domestic capacity to produce that equipment.
and that is why I'm so pleased to be seeing all of those Canadian companies that have stepped up to produce the necessary equipment and that equipment will be available very soon.



**Reporter**:
You've been able to deliver personal protective equipment to provinces that need it but is the supply chain broken if a pregnant nurse has to reuse masks and gloves?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
These are decisions that are taken by provinces and how they extend and how they require the use of P.P.E. Different provinces have different burn rates in terms of use of P.P.E. We have worked as a federal government to ensure that when provinces have made requests of us for more personal protective equipment, we've been able to deliver what was needed.
These are things we're fighting for every single day and want everyone to have the equipment they need.



**Interpreter**:
The provinces make their own decisions with respect to their health care system.
and the use of personal protective equipment.
Our responsibility as the federal government is to be there to support the provinces and be able to help meet their needs and, thus far, in most cases, we've been able to meet those needs.
But, of course, we must continue to do everything we can.



**Reporter**:
Prime Minister, when you were talking about the gun control legislation, you brought up the tragedy in Nova Scotia.
I wanted to know if you've been briefed on what kind of gun or guns were used in Nova Scotia.
Do we know that they were legal and, based on that, how would your proposed gun control legislation have potentially prevented the shooting?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
There is still a tremendous investigation going on by the RCMP right now.
Many, many different sites and different questions that a lot of people have and I'm going to trust the RCMP on releasing information as they feel it is important to.



**Reporter**:
With regards to the gun control, why are you joining the two?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We have gun control legislation ready to move forward on. We were ready -- almost ready to move forward on it a number of weeks ago.
We continue to see it as a priority.
We had every intention and have every intention of continuing to move forward on it when things restore to order.
It did not need or take this tragedy for us to be committed to gun control.
We've long been committed to it. This is just another tragic reminder of the fact that we need to do more to keep Canadians safe.



**Reporter**:
As a follow-up, on the world health organization, ireland said it would quadruple funding for the W.H.O. and Australia and the rick and -- and the United Kingdom are calling for an independent investigation of the handing of the crisis.
Are we going to be calling for an investigation?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We have been increasing our contribution to the W.H.O. In order to deal with this pandemic.
We fund them to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a year.
At the same imtoo, we do need to find answers to how this happened so we unction how to ensure that it never happens again and that is certainly something Canada will be part of.



**Reporter**:
FranÇois?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
We continue to tribute to the world health organization.
This is an important institution, particularly in pandemics but we will have to get some answers in order to better protect ourselves as a country and as a planet.
So that we're better prepared for the next potential pandemic.



**Reporter**:
Should Canadians be concerned about the security of their food supply chain and what more can the government do to protect that supply chain?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
We heard from Canadian beef producers and associations that the priority will be to ensure supply.
Right now the priority is on domestic supply.
We're not anticipating shortages of beef but prices will go up. At the same time, we know that it is extremely important to do everything we can to keep Canadians safe, to keep workers in all industries across this country essential or not, as safe as we possibly can and I'm pleased to see measures being taken reflected on how to keep people safe.



**Interpreter**:
The reality is that a meat processing plant has prioritized deliveries to the Canadian market.
There may be lower exports in that case, but we want to ensure that our supply chain for beef products is functioning.
The reality is that there may be higher prices but we'll be monitoring that closely.
But the important thing in all of this is to ensure that we're protecting workers in essential and other industries.
Protecting them from COVID-19 and we must take the necessary measures to keep them safe.



**Reporter**:
and on oil prices, is there going to be further support for the oil industry and beyond that, for provinces that rely heavily on oil revenues and refinance their debt to recover from this downturn?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
Our focus from the beginning has been on helping Canadians, families, workers across this country and we have put in place a significant measure that has an impact on all industries, including the oil industry with the Canadian emergency response benefit and wage subsidies that have helped thousands of workers across Alberta and the oil sector in this country.
We moved forward on other measures as well to help out that sector specifically and we're always open to working more on helping particular industries or areas that need support to get through this COVID-19 crisis.
We'll continue those discussions.
On the supporting provinces, we recognize that various provinces are facing real challenges in terms of cash crunches and liquidity and our department of finance are engaged closely with different provinces on challenges that they're facing specifically.



**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Now earlier in your speech, you said there was some positive science and I won't Earp what those positive signs are in your opinion.
and on the wage subsidy, can you assure us that not $1 of taxpayer money will go to companies that have money in tax havens?well, in terms of encouraging signs, when we look at the pandemic curves and the numbers in terms of spread of COVID-19, we can see that there has been a the decline in the numbers.
Now we see the numbers going up in certain parts of the country.
But there are fewer and fewer cases each day and we hope that what this means is that the measures we've been taking are now helping.
and are now helping the expected outcome.
At the same time, we need to keep those measures in place because if we relax them too soon, we could end up in a situation where COVID-19 would ramp up again and this is not something we would want to see happen.
In terms of our approach in helping businesses, we have always been focused on help for workers.
We did not want to judge whether someone working for a small halifax store or for a large internation hardware chain would be treated differently.
We wanted to ensure that workers and families that depend on that income would have the necessary help and that is why we moved forward with the wage six did and moving forward with the emergency response benefit.
I'd like to say that we are always working hard to fight tax havens and tax avoidance.
We have taken very strong measures to try and recover that money and impose serious consequences on companies that take advantage of those tax havens and we'll continue to do that.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
As I said a couple of times, I think there is reason for cautious optimism.
We're hearing that from mode cal officers across the country.
Noting that the increase in cases is getting smaller every day in many places.
That we are still seeing more cases every day, but fewer than in previous days, which is a sign that our efforts are working.
We are continuing to do the right things as a country, that is getting this virus under control.
However, we need to continue to do those things because as soon as we loosen up, if we loosen up too quickly or if we're not careful, we could see a return spike of COVID-19 that would be problematic for citizens and for the economic recovery.
We'll focus on making sure that we're doing things very, very carefully.
But it is encouraging to see the things that Canadians are doing from coast to coast to coast, to help each other out and stay safe are working and that is why we need to continue them.



**Reporter**:
[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Now just to understand with respect to tax havens, you didn't really answer My question.
Can you tell Canadians today that the money that you paid in taxes will not go to companies that have accounts in tax havens?can you assure us of that today or can you not assure us of that today?we are helping workers right across this country.
Someone who works for a company whose family depends on that job and has lost that job needs help.
Needs to be able to pay for groceries or pay rent.
It is that reason that we decided to help people, whether it is a small company or big company.
We are helping workers who need that support.
Now with respect to tax avieed answer, we will continue to fight that sort of action.
and choices made by some companis who refuse to pay their fair share of taxes.
We have invested more than $1 billion in the Canada revenue agency so that we have more tools available to us to target those companies.



**Rosemary**:
All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily update on how his government is tackling the pandemic.
I'm going to bring back Vassy and David and each 30 seconds because we're close to the top of the clock.
Vassy, you can have the first 30.



**Vassy**:
Really quickly, I'll summarize what he announced for the wage subsidy.
You can apply if you are a business owner starting in one week, I believe April 27. and the other part was about $350 million for charities.
What stuck out for me, two planes -- this is a question from the conservative leader ..two empty planes came back from china confirm big issues getting personal protective equipment out of that country.



**Rosemary**:
Wow.
She left you 10 seconds there, David Go ahead.[laughter]



**Reporter**:
Beef supply.
Beef producers have ensured the government they will meet domestic need before they start doing exports.
Supply should not go down.
But prices may very well go up.



**Rosemary**:
Ok. Thank you both very much.
So succinct.
I should make you do that all the time.[laughter]Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane.$350 million that Vassy talked about there does not include the option for charities for wage subsidies.
While their ask was substantive at $10 billion, they get $350 million to help them and they can also start using the wage subsidy, which we'll get more details about at noon eastern at the next federal briefing coming up and we'll bring you up to date on any new information we have about the shooting rampage in Nova Scotia which has killed as many as 20 people now.
We are not necessarily expecting to get a briefing from the local RCMP today.
But we will get some details probably via press release in terms of how their investigation over those 16 different crime scenes is going and we'll talk about that at the top of the clock as well and bring you all details in terms of the stories that we're learning about the people that were killed over the course of weekend in Nova Scotia as that community and that whole province continues to strugle with that during the time of the pandemic.
Also incountried ble challenging for them on so many fronts.
Ok. I think I'm going to wrap it up. We'll hear shortly from our federal cabinet ministers who will give us a short briefing more about the wage subsidy that opens up on monday and a public health update to give us a sense of how we're doing in fighting the pandemic.
Some encouraging signs.
But we still have to keep doing what we're doing.
The sky is looking better in ottawa.
We'll be right back on cbc news network after this.[please stand by] they said yesterday one of the reasons that the death toll, thenumber of casualties and fatalities is going up is because officers are only now getting access to a few of the numerous sites across the province.
and so they will be combing through the that the application process will open up in a week's time.
That is significant to business owners.
There has been some information provided to a committee on the length of time.
Your producer helped us with that.
The time to get money into the pockets of business owners.
That is something we'll be looking for more details on fromminister duclos.
I think the time line, the issueof time for employers is huge.
a lot of them have struggled to keep employees on the payroll.
I'm speaking specifically of businesses, for example, small businesses, but also the huge companies.
Think about air Canada and westjet.
They signalled they would take advantage of this programme but the details are going to be important.
At the end of the Prime Minister's press conference he got a question, is this going to be available to companies that use tax havens.
There wasn't a specific answer on that, but that does raise a broader discussion about who exactly will be eligible.
If this follows in the pattern of other aid packages, the scopewill be broad.
Or who can do that.
That does present later on a number I think of complication or questions that will arise about who was able to avail themselves or what kind of company was able to avail themselves of this kind of financial relief or financial aid.
I don't think the government hastime at this juncture.
Especially when everybody is saying we need this money fast to go through and look at every thing a company has done, but I think that will factor into the discussion later on.



**Rosemary**:
We heard when the Prime Minister made the initial announcement, David he wasn't going to tolerate people taking advantage of it. So it's a little bit different than the CERB, the relief fund benefit, which I think is just sort of everybody thinks they can apply can apply and there is less concern around that.
But there does seem to be some perhaps added scrutiny to the way this is going to work.



**Reporter**:
There is a couple of things.
On the tax haven idea, that is aconsideration, but the wage subsidy is a flow-through to theworker.
It's not money that goes into the bank account of the company and they get to keep it. This is using them as a payroll department to get the money to workers.
The tax haven thing is an interesting conversation, but it's not material because this is money in the pockets of workers rather than employers, though they do get a residual benefit from this.
It may be slower to roll out than the CERB.
The CERB has been a tremendous success, but it was one-size-fits-all.
This is different.
It's wage subsidy, which is equivalent to the maximum c. P.p. Amount and then it's a sliding scale of what the precise dollaramount would be. That will take a little more time.
The application scrutiny will bedone after the fact.
There will a post pandemic compliance thing, but how much money to send to a company?that's a little rougher to deal with than the CERB.
The two other issues the Prime Minister spoke about, P.P.E., two planes came back from china, nothing onboard.
I'm told by the government official, all of the P.P.E. Equipment is under lock and key in the warehouse in shanghai.
It was safely store and will be making its way back to Canada.
There is another flight coming in today, but it speaks to the chaos there.
The world is trying to get masksand gloves out of china and largely funneling cargo planes into one or two airports.
This is causing backlog of trucks, they need security, there is limited landing windows, tarmac time and if yourstuff haven't made it through and you're on the plane, you're out of luck.
You have to figure out how to get it another time.
Those supplies have not been lost.
The other thing the Prime Minister was asked about is gun legislation.
When is he going to bring in guncontrol?something that has been delayed because of the change in everything.
One of the restrictions is rightnow the agreement struck to havethe house only sit one day in person and then virtual sittingsafter.
The legislation can only be about the pandemic.
So they can't bring it right nowwhile they're operating under this deal.
They have to wait until the end of may when there is a hope theycan go back to the normal rules, or they would need consent and agreement, including from the conservatives, who have been on the opposite side of this debatefrom the federal liberals.
Quickly, you can't.



**Rosemary**:
He did say they were on the verge of bringing it in before this happened.
I mean, I'm not sure exactly what means.
It certainly wasn't something on the notice paper.



Bill Blair said it was going to be done in the spring session.
Going back to the cabinet retreat in January I want to say.
But it was something on their to-do list for the session.



**Rosemary**:
Going back to the Chinese planes, the planes in china, because they were our planes in china.
It does speak to, though, the lack of reliability on P.P.E. Coming, maybe particularly from china, but maybe from everywhere.
and the fact that you're sendingover government planes to get things and they're coming back empty and now, it's great if youconfirm, david, it's still there, still in the warehouse.
But now we're waiting more days for it to get here and we don't have a lot of time in terms of getting that stuff to people.



**Vassy**:
It's huge.
Think about it, we have planes going over there to pick up equipment and because they don'tfit into the time frame the Chinese government has allowed, they're having to come all the way back to Canada empty.
and that equipment, we heard a number of questions to the Prime Minister, and those should be pointed toward each of the provinces, because a lot of the jurisdiction lies with them, but there are genuine questions about how many health care workers are having to reuse their equipment?or are worried, yes, they have to the supply right now, but maynot in a few weeks' time.
We've heard them throughout the entire pandemic.
It highlights the issue and Canada and the fact that we are incredibly reliant on china and the procurement of these supplies in that country.
They haven't specifically -- I'mtrying to think about the interviews with the Minister in charge of this -- I've asked many times, how much of our stuff comes from china?and they won't put a percentage on it, but often uses the word "significant" to describe it. It's clear we have a heavy reliance on that country.
Things are not easy in china right now.
Certainly they haven't been.
But they really aren't right now.
We've seen planes stopped going to the United States as well.
It's a global issue right now and I think there is no easy fix, but the idea of these planes sort of leaving with nothing in them and, yes, you'reright, it's good we have the supplies still, we haven't lost them, it's not like they're gone, but it remains an issue they have to come all the way back here.
If I could touch on the gun legislation you were talking about.
There are genuine questions of accountability for the government.
I take the point given the current structure of parliament it's not going to be happening soon.
That is -- they did massive consultations on what this type of bill would look like, following calls from the mayors of toronto and montreal to bringin stricter gun control.
Those consultations wrapped a full year ago.
Then they promised in the campaign to bring in legislation.
Then they promised on the anniversary of ecole polytechnique that was coming soon.
Bill blair signalled it was going to come, I think david pointed out, in the spring.
With we don't know if that -- wedon't know if that would have made a difference.
But on the specific question about that legislation, you know, yes, it was intended to beintroduced, but they've had multiple opportunities in the past prior to this outbreak to do so. and they had signalled for a long time, many had raised the issue.



**Rosemary**:
I think they said after the consultation they wanted to campaign on it to get a mandate and that's what they were going to do this spring.
You're right, there will be questions.
Thank you, both.
I'll take the viewers to the federal briefing.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland is speaking about what happened in Nova Scotia.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:
It is to difficult to process it when they are lost.
At the events in Nova Scotia over the weekend.
This would be a tragedy at any time.
But for this to happen now as nova Scotians are all making great personal sacrifices to preserve life is a particular horror and particular sorrow.
To the people of Nova Scotia, all Canadians with are you in your grief.
So today we will hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam.
The deputy chief public, Dr. Howard njoo.



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:
[speaking french]there are now 37, 000 -- 37, 374 cases including 1, 728 deaths.
We have tested over 565, 000 people to date with around 6.5% of those testing positive.
But we are still aways off and the path remains uncertain.
I know recovery is what is on everyone's mind right now.
Canadians are continuing to practise social distancing, physical distancing, and stayingat home.
and this continues to be vitallyimportant.
Public health authorities are closely monitoring for continuedand stable slowing of the epidemic, while carefully considering approaches to ease public health restrictions when and where there is possible.
But there are hard truths that haven't changed.
This is a marathon and we're going to have to plan, pace ourselves and not take sharp turns.
The second truth, there is stilla lot of unknowns and no 100% proven path before us. To get this right, there will bea need to learn as we go, evaluate and adjust as we take cautious steps.
These next steps may sound challenging, but there are things we learned and things we know will keep us safe as we carefully navigate this path forward together.
We know that the epidemiology ineach jurisdiction is different, so the approaches won't all be the same.
We know the timing, types and range of public health measures will be tailored to address the unique challenges and context ofthe disease in each province andterritory.
Likewise, additional measures may need be to adopted and maintained to protect vulnerablepopulations in high-risk settings within jurisdictions.
Most importantly, we know that Canadians have demonstrated whathas worked to slow the spread ofthis disease and what has kept our health system from being overwhelmed.
There is no doubt that our sacrifices and everyday inconveniences over the past weeks have prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada like the ones that overwhelm health care systems in places like italy, spain and new york.
What all this tells us, we can'tbe too confident.
We can't let our guard down.
and we can't afford to have any weak points in our system.
What we can do is ensure we all work together, stay the course and work to strengthen supports that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of society.
If we ensure that basic needs are met for everyone we will protect the health of all Canadians.
Thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Now we'll hear from the minister of families.



Thank you very much, Bonjour.
When the experience personal difficulties as a result of natural disasters, be it wildfires in British Columbia or tornado right here in Ottawa or something closer to home, like losing a job, that every time countless charities across the country are there to help them.
They're there to step up and help them in every way they can.
Canadian charities and non-profits are there to help us in our time of need.[speaking french][voice of interpreter] charity organizations are always there to help Canadians in times of need.[end of translation] bringing real challenges to these really important organizations.
At the very time that countless Canadians across the country arerelying on these organizations, some for the very first time, canadian charities and non-profits are having to deal with extra costs procuring and obtaining personal protective equipment, increased costs as a result of staffing shortages.
Other challenges as a result of getting materials needed to do their work.
and to make matters worse, they also experiencing a dramatic drop in the amount of donations they usually receive.
At a time when canadian charities and non-profit organizations are asked to do more by Canadians who need theirservices, they're seeing a drop in donations and the number of volunteers they can rely on. This has a direct impact on vulnerable Canadians.
Like older Canadians, people with disabilities, racialized Canadians, including black-Canadians, are being significantly impacted by these developments.
So our message to Canada's community organizations and charities is that we will support you.
The time that more and more Canadians are calling on you to provide more services for them, we will support you so that you can meet that request, so that you can answer that call.
As the Prime Minister said, we have your back.
That is why the Prime Minister announced that we are providing $350 million to support in emergency fashion to help charities and non-profit organizations adapt their frontline services to vulnerablecanadians during COVID-19.[speaking french][voice of interpreter] that's why the Prime Minister announced up to $350 million in emergency funding for charity organizations and non-profit organizations.
These organizations are providing help to Canadians during COVID-19.[end of translation] like the united way, the canadian red cross and community foundations of Canada, to ensure charities and non-profit organizations from across the country are ableto provide much needed support to vulnerable Canadians.
and they will be able to do thisby flowing the money quickly to everyone, including local community-based organizations that have the relationships thatknow the people in their communities who need these services immediately.
This money will help groups likethose in eastern Ontario that are working to provide meals to those who cannot leave their homes.
Who are not able to do that.
It would also help organizationssuch as the atlantic compassion fund, or the vancouver foundation which is providing much needed support to women fleeing domestic violence.
We know these are very difficulttimes for Canadians, but the government of Canada is working to ensure that those organizations that Canadians arerelying on have the resources that they need so they can continue to help Canadians now and into the future.
I want to thank all the organizations, charities, and community leaders, including faith leaders, that have reachedout to me and My colleagues overthe last number of weeks for their hard work on this and their feedback and their guidance on how to get this right.
Lastly, I want to thank the volunteers and the front-line workers, the service providers, who are tirelessly working day and night to provide much neededcritical services to our most vulnerable in their homes and intheir communities.
Thank you so much for everythingthat you do.[speaking french][voice of interpreter] we are here for you.
Thank you.
