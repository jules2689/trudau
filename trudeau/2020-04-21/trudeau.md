[speaking french].hello, everyone.
I want to begin by noting the innocent men, women and children systematically murder by the nazis.
 also pay tribute to the brave itself and resiliency of survivors and all those who risked their lives to save others during the holocaust.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
First of all, I'd like to say that this is holocaust remembrance day.
Today we remember the six million men and women who were systematically murdered by the Nazis paying frill to the courage and resilience of the survivors and all those who risked their lives to save others during the holocaust.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
This morning, I want to again extend My most sincere condolences to the friends and families of the victims of terrible Nova Scotia attacks.
Since yesterday, I've had a chance to speak with constable chad  the RCMP officer who was wounded as well as constable Heidi stevenson's family.
On behalf of all Canadians, I thanked them for their service and their sacrifice.
Yesterday, when I offered My sympathies to the RCMP officers who support me, I was amazed to see how many of them knew Heidi and had incredibly fond memories of her and worked with her on the musical ride.
They remembered her as an extraordinary person and it really goes to show just how tightly knit not just the RCMP is as a force, but how close we are as a country.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Yesterday, I had a chance to mention to the RCMP officers with me that I wanted to extend My condolences to them and I was very happy to hear about their stories about her.
They served on the musical ride with her and told me what an extraordinary person she was.
and that made me realise that it is not only about the RCMP being family and connected can, but all of US as Canadians being connected.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
The Canadian police and peace officers memorial on parliament hill to pay tribute to constable Stevenson and recognize the contributions of all law enforcement members to keep US safe.
I also spoke to a number of colleagues from Nova Scotia, both past and present, and sought Senator Sam kutcher's advice.
These calls all reinforce what had we know about Nova Scotia -- that it's a special place where people stick together and look out for each other.

It's now been a number of weeks that we've been asking everyone to follow experts' destroys protect your health and the health of others.
The lock down t social and physical distancing are an adjustment for most of US But for some, the consequences of the pandemic are far more profound than a simple adjustment.
The virus has had the effect of worsening the inequalities that already exist in our society.
The most vulnerable, seniors and young homeless or people without jobs or single-parent families.
Many are all particularly affected by Covid  the same time, the total number of people who need help to get through this difficult period has also gone up. Woel  the pandemic upset our lives, charities were there for our communities.
I'm thinking of PEI Royal in park extension that helps young people at risk or an organization in st. Michele.
In papineau,  across the country, community organisations are an essential resource for the most vulnerable and their mission in this pandemic does not change.
But they need more support in order to help a large number of people.
and expanding clientele.
So, the government is putting in place the emergency fund for community support today.
This will be an envelope of $350 million to support community organisations and nonprofit organisations.
Part of the money will go droektly  small independent organisations and the rest will go through the national organization like the united way and the red cross.
This is money our community leaders will be able to use to train volunteers or increase deliveries at home for the seniors or provide transportation services for people with a disability.
With this fund, we are giving organisations more resources to adjust to the current realities and difficulties associated with COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
Charities and nonprofit organisations were doing crucial work to help our communities.
Their mission has always been to support people in their time of need and that hasn't changed.
But COVID-19 is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on those organisations because more people need help.
Back in march, one united way partner in Winnipeg made and district ed 1475 emergency kits for families, seniors and homeless people in just five days.
They had to change services because of the rules that everyone has to follow to keep each other safe.
Here in  there are a number of organisations focused on serving isolated seniors.
Usually they have day programme where seniors can socialize, participate in activities, eat well and maintain a connection to their community.
That is no longer possible because of COVID-19 so organisations are now delivering meals and providing support via phone.
In  Tropicana community services is now helping vulnerable youth access their COVID-19 benefits.
It takes resources to make these adjust.
S, resources these groups don't have because they're spread so thin trying to help as many people as possible.
So to support charities and nonprofits in their important work, our government is setting up a $350 million emergency community support fund.
a portion of these funds will go directly to smaller, independent front line organisations and the rest will flow through national organisations like the united way community foundations Canada and the red cross that can get funds to local organisations and vulnerable people quickly.
This is money for things like training volunteers, increasing at-home deliveries for seniors or driving people with disabilities to appointments.
With this fund, we're giving more resources to charities and nonprofits so they can adapt to the new realities and difficulties brought on by this pandemic.[speaking french].

I want to turn now to some encouraging news on the innovation front.
Our super cluster initiative brings together small, medium-sized and large companies, academic institutions and not-for-profit organizations to generate bold ideas and innovate.
So a few weeks ago, the digital technology supercluster challenged its  of over 500 firms to come up with solutions to help Canadians get through this pandemic.
They received over 300 submissions and they are now moving forward on a number of key projects.
Toronto's DNA Stack is developing a new cloud-based network that allows researchers who are looking to improve our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19 to share their  Another company, foodex, is working with  partners to develop an e-grocery management system to make sure our health care workers, seniors and others have access to fresh food dhurg crisis.-- during this crisis.
 innovators are among the best in the world and it is great to see so many of them use their talents to help our communities.
This is yet another example of what we can achieve when we work together as team Canada.[speaking french].
