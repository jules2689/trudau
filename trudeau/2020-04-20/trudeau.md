**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:


[speaking french] 

[voice of interpreter] good morning, everyone.

[end of translation] we are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic, to save lives, and to help each other make it to a better day.
But yesterday we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy in Nova Scotia.
a gunman claimed the lives of atleast 18 people.
Among them, a woman in uniform whose job it is to protect lives, even if it endangers her own, constable heidi stevenson of the RCMP.
Constable stevenson died protecting others.
She was answering the call of duty, something she had done every day when she went to work for 23 years.
This happened in small towns, Portapique, Truro, millford, andenfield are people have deep roots, places where people know their neighbours and look out for everyone.
There everyone knows a mountie because they're everything from social workers to teen counsellors.
Now these communities are in mourning and Canada is in mourning with them.
To the grandparents who lost a child, to the children who lost a parent, to the neighbour who lost a friend, we are so sorry for your loss.
Such a tragedy should have neveroccurred.
Violence of any kind has no place in Canada.
We stand with you and we grieve with you and you can count on our government's full support during this incredibly painful time.

[speaking french] 

[voice of interpreter] yesterday, at least18 people lost their lives aftera shoot-out in Nova Scotia, plunging families and their loved ones in mourning.
Some lost children, some lost a parent, some lost a friend.
Our thoughts and the thoughts ofall Canadians are with you.
Such a tragedy should never haveoccurred.
There is no place for violence in our country.
We share in your mourning and westand with you and mourn with you as you go through these verypainful times.

[end of translation] I want to wish a full and speedy recovery to all those injured, including another RCMP officer.
Canada is a vast and sweeping country, filled with long stretches of lonely roads.
With unwavering courage and compassion, our royal canadian mounted police patrol these roads to keep us safe, as they have for over 100 years.
I know from coast to coast to coast, the women and men who wear the red surge in service tocanada are grieving deeply the loss of one of their own and one of our best.
This tragedy is a painful reminder of the risks all of ourfirst responders take to keep ussafe, of the sacrifices they mayevery single day to protect our communities, paramedics, doctors, nurses, firefighters, and police officers, they're always here for us. They've been stepping up throughthe pandemic, and yesterday in Nova Scotia they showed that bravery.
I want to take a moment to thankthem all for the professionalismand their courage.
Many of you are already working overtime because of this pandemic.
Our communities need you now more than ever.
I know that can weigh on you at times.
These are exceptional circumstances, yet you did what you always do. You ran towards danger, without pause, without hesitation, you put your life on the line.
On behalf of all Canadians, thank you for your service.

[speaking french] 

[voice of interpreter] I'd just like to take a moment to thank all our first responders for their courage and their professionalism.
You're already working hard because of the pandemic.
More than ever, we need you, andsometimes that must seem to be aheavy responsibility and burden on your shoulders.
Despite these exceptional circumstances, you have done what you're used to doing.
You did not hesitate to risk your own lives to save others.
On behalf of all Canadians, thank you for everything you're doing.

[end of translation] this day ismade all the more difficult because of the precious lives lost and the senseless act of one person.
Just how could this happen?we may never know why.
But we do know this.
Know one man's action can build a wall between us and a better day, no matter how evil, how thoughtless, or how destructive.
Canadians are kind and generous.
We are there for each other and we look out for one another.
As families grieve the loss of aloved one, all Canadians are standing with them.
The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be heldvirtually to celebrate the livesof the victims on 7:00 p. M. on friday, through the facebook group account -- "colchester supporting our community."it's important we come together to support our communities.
I've spoken with premier mcneil, RCMP commissioner lufti and manyother nova Scotians.
I know that people have questions.
This is an ongoing investigation, but the RCMP and local authorities will keep you updated.
I want to ask the media to avoidmentioning the name and showing the picture of the person involved.
Do not give him the gift of infamy.
Let us instead focus all our attention on the lives we lost and the families and friends whogrieve.

[speaking french] 

[voice of interpreter] while the pandemic will prevent us from gathering and mourning together, a virtualvigil will be held on friday at 7:00 p. M. through the facebook group colchester supporting our community.
It will be an opportunity to support the lives of these victims and be there for their families and their loved ones.
I hope many of you will join with us on this occasion.
As we seek to understand what happened yesterday, we must be there for each other.
Since this tragedy I've had discussions with premier mcneil, the RCMP commissioner brenda lucki, the Minister of public safety bill blair, our Nova Scotia caucus, among other people.
We will continue to work together on this issue.
I know people have questions.
The investigation is still underway, but I can assure you the RCMP and local authorities will make you aware of latest developments.
I'm also asking the media not touse the name or photos of the person behind these terrible actions.
Let's not give him this gift, but focus instead on the victimsand the loved ones.

[end of translation] I want to address the kids in Nova Scotia and right across the country.
I know the world can seem like amean and ugly place right now, but there is a whole lot of goodin the world too.
You'll see it in your neighboursand in Canadians in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
This is a difficult time and it can be a scary time too, but we're here for you and we're going to get through this together.
I promise.

First question Laura Osman "the Canadian press."line open.

**Question**:
Mr. Prime Minister, conservative leader Andrew schemer accused you of being inflexible about the number of sittings in parliament.
I wonder if there's any room fora compromise, two sittings per week, given that moving forward may be preferable to no deal at all?



**Answer**:
Look, I don't want to get into arguments with anyone today.
We are working together amongst all parties to try to figure out a way to both protect and uphold our democracy to ensure that there is proper accountability, while at the same time doing that responsibly.
I'm hopeful we will be able to come to an appropriate arrangement.



Follow-up question.

**Question**:
I was wondering if we could have an accounting of all of the ways that the opposition has been kept informed of the ongoing crisis and the government's actions outside of the house to date.



**Answer**:
As I said, we have been engaged with all parties over the course of the pandemic.
There have been many good ideas brought forward by business leaders, community groups, individual Canadians, but also by M.P.s from their communities about what is needed to help.
We are trying to make sure we are giving Canadians the help they need to get through this difficult time and we will continue to do that.



**Operator**:
Next question Kate bongero, bloomberg.
Line open.

**Question**:
Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.
I have a question for you regarding navigating Canada through this crisis.
Obviously you're leading this g7country through this pandemic and you've also been personally impacted by this.
I'm wondering, how would you saythis pandemic has impacted your governing style as a leader and your perception of your role as a Prime Minister?



**Answer**:
I think one of the things we've seen right across the country is how Canadians have pulled together through this difficult time, and that's something we've always done.
We make sure we're there for each other when we encounter.
We've seen Canadians step up for each other.
The privilege of being able to serve Canadians through this difficult time is really quite something when you see just how Canadians are resolute in their desire to support each other through this.
Obviously the capacity to work across all orders of government, work together as a country, is what is keeping us on a good path through this.
There are too many tragedies to name going on as people lose loved ones right across the country, but at the same time we know that what we are doing is helping prevent further tragedies.
We're going to continue to do that.



On a follow-up, kate.

**Question**:
How would you say -- how would you describe your strategy?what has it been in terms of inside the p. M.o. Office to getting us through these tough times and how would you say -- how would you assess your own performance on that?



**Answer**:
Our focus every step of the way has been listening to the best advice from experts and scientists on what we need to do to keep Canadians safe in this and to ensure that everything we're doing is giving Canadians the comfort and confidence that we're all in this together and that we are going to be there for each.
I think that is key to making sure people are able to self-isolate and are able to take the difficult measures necessary to get us through thispandemic, to know as a country, as systems, and as government, we're there for each other and making sure that Canadians have support and know that we will get through this together, that has been key in getting through this together.

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I understand that you don't really want to talk about parliament at this time, but I do have to discuss this with you in spite of that.
I would like you to comment on your impression of what citizens are thinking looking at what's happening in Ottawa right now.
People are at home and have been there for more than a month now.
We are seeing what's happening with this pandemic.
and now parliament is resuming in person because a number of political parties can't agree.
What do you think citizens are thinking to themselves in seeing this today?



**Answer**:
Well, I think citizens understand that it is important, not because of the crisis or in spite of the crisis, but that we continue to defend our institutions in parliament and to do that responsibly.
I think it's important to continue to have questions and to talk about the measures that will help Canadians.
We are proposing various ways of working together responsibly andconstructively.
Most of the parties agree and I know that there will be further discussions today to try and figure out what the process should be and how we could defend our democratic principle sand institutions.

---

**Question**:
There is some parties -- well, one party, the bloc quÉbÉcois, which is accusing the conservatives of holding parliament hostage.
I'd like to have you comment on that characterization of the current situation.
I'd also like to hear you comment on the idea of a compromise in the sense that there is one party demanding three in-person sittings per week.
You don't agree.
and if you don't agree, there will be five.
That would seem to be worse based on your current perspective, where you're sayingnow there should be almost none.
Do you not think it would be better to negotiate and try to agree on three sittings rather than being stuck with five?



**Answer**:
I do not want to get involved in any partisan bickering today.
I don't think that's something Canadians want to see.
Canadians do want to know that we are doing our job and defending our institutions and continuing to allow our parliament to function in the midst of a crisis so that we're asking the right questions and getting the right answers.
I am very confident that today we will be able to agree on a approach that will ensure the continuity of our parliamentary institutions in this difficult time, but also be able to do that in a responsible way.

---

**Question**:
Yes, good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Will your government be introducing legislation to tighten up gun control, given what has just happened in Nova Scotia?



**Answer**:
Well, obviously there are many, many questions now and there is an investigation to be conducted as to what exactly happened in Nova Scotia.
I don't want to draw any conclusions yet, but there will be a commitment in terms of tightening up gun control.
We were to the point where we would have introduced legislation to ban assault weapons in this country.
We will bring forward those measures again as soon as we have an opportunity to do so once we have come through COVID-19.



Follow up.

**Question**:
Yes.
In quÉbec this morning, construction workers have gone back to their construction sites.
Now, is your government in support of this measure being taken in quÉbec and across the country potentially?



**Answer**:
Well, I think that the various jurisdictions are making their own decisions within their field of jurisdiction.
I think it's up to each region and province to determine what can be done at what time.
We are trying to coordinate these actions right across the country, but of course the decisions will be different from one place to the other.
and of course it is absolutely critical that whatever decisions are made, the health and safety of workers and all Canadians to avoid the further spread of COVID-19 must be the top priority if we're talking about any type of work starting up again.[end of translation].

---

**Question**:
You promised a ban on assault-style weapons.
Given what we know about the shooting in Nova Scotia, could that have prevented these crimes?if not, would you consider even tighter gun-control measures?



**Answer**:
As we know, this is very much an ongoing investigation that is in its early stages in Nova Scotia right now.
So I don't want to jump to conclusions or make characterizations about what happens until we get a full accounting from the authorities.
But in regards to gun control, we took very serious commitments in the election campaign and are moving forward on them to make sure we're strengthening gun control in this country.
I can say we were on the verge of introducing legislation to ban assault-style weapons acrossthe country.
It was interrupted when the pandemic caused parliament to besuspended.
We have ever intention of movingforward on that measure and potentially other measures when the parliament returns.

---

**Question**:
Would you return of relaxing some physical distancing measures to allow the people in Nova Scotia to bury their loved ones properly?



**Answer**:
I think that's a reflection that communities, that the province, and that all of us are going to have to have.
We understand how incredibly painful it is for families who've lost loved ones in Nova Scotia this past day to imagine that they're not going to be able to see them off together as a community.
But at the same time, there are thousands and thousands of Canadians across the country who've lost loved ones to COVID-19 over the past days and others who lost family members to cancer and to other causes who haven't been able to gather, to mourn, to grieve, to attend funerals.
This is something that we are dealing with right now that is heart break on top of other heart breaks.
and I know that everyone will be looking for ways to demonstrate their solidarity without putting further at risk communities, first responders, our health professionals, and our seniors.[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] I recognize that there are people who have lost loved ones in this past day or so in Nova Scotia.
There are also people who have lost family members and friends or parents in the recent weeks because of COVID-19. They have been unable to come together for funerals or to mourn together.
This is a difficult situation made even worse in times of lossand mourning.
But we must continue to try to be there for each other in thesetragic times and ensure that we are not creating greater risk for our loved ones, our neighbours, our first responders, or healthcare workers.
We need to do everything we can to keep people safe and healthy, even in the midst of this tragedy and pandemic.[end of translation].

**Question**:
Prime Minister, was the Nova Scotia shooter on the federal government's radar?were any federal agencies watching him?



**Answer**:
There are many questions people are asking about what happened and that investigation and the RCMP will be sharing details as they can and choose in the coming days.
There will be many opportunities to talk about this once we have a clearer idea of the facts.

---

**Question**:
What did you think when you learned about the degree of planning in this terrible crime?does it concern you someone could create such a good fake?



**Answer**:
I think as we learn more about this we'll have to ask ourselves many questions about how it happened and what we can do to keep communities safe in the future.
My first thoughts when I heard of this tragedy yesterday and saw the numbers climb in terms of victims, My first thought was for nova Scotians, who for the most part know each other so much.
They are such a connected group that I know the vast majority of nova Scotians will have a direct link with one or more of the many victims.
The entire province and the entire country is grieving right now as we come to grips with something that is absolutely unimaginable.

**Question**:
Kevin Gallagher CTV news.
Prime Minister, as we're talking about the tragedy in nova scotiaand Canadians living under strict public health guidelines, how appropriate is it to bring back parliament.
Why can't your government reach a deal on this?



**Answer**:
I'm very hopeful that over the course of the day Canadians will see parliamentarians coming together to demonstrate that our democracy is strong, that our institutions need to function, including during difficult times, indeed because of the difficult time we're going through, but that we can do so in a responsible way.
As I've said, there is agreement amongst most of the parties in the house of commons.
I hope to see by the end of this day that we're all in a place where we can both have our parliamentary institutions functioning, but doing so in a responsible way, given the context we're in.[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] I do hope that between now and the end of the day, we will have found a way ofensuring that our parliament is functioning, that our democracy is functioning.
We will have to see.
We do have the agreement of a number of parliamentarians.
We will find the right solution in order to continue to sit as aparliament responsibly given thecurrent circumstances.[end of translation].

---

**Question**:
What responsibility does your government take for not having this deal in place?



**Answer**:
I think it's all of our collective responsibility todo the best we can through this difficult situation.
It is really important to me that we continue to uphold our democracy, the democratic principles, the principles of accountability, the ability to move forward with new legislation to help Canadians.
That really matters, but it really matters that we do so responsibly, that we have agreement amongst most parties.
I'm hopeful that by the end of the day today we'll have a clear path forward that will both defend our institutions and appreciate the context that we're in right now.

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] radio-Canada.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I understand that there are questions that will be asked formany weeks to come about what happened in Nova Scotia, but My question is more about Canada ingeneral.
How is it that in 2020 we are still seeing mass shootings likethis?



**Answer**:
Well, this is a tragic situation that reminds us that unfortunately there is still gun violence in this country.
We have taken steps to try and strengthen gun control in Canada, but we must do more.
We have pledged to do more and we will do more.
We need to make sure Canadians can live in safety, in their communities, in their streets, and that's what we will continue to work on together.

---

**Question**:
Now, will you be participating in that ceremony and could you introduce your gun control bill in the coming weeks?parliament will be sitting, so you could introduce it as early as this week.



**Answer**:
Yes, I intend to participate in the virtual vigil as much as possible.
We will most certainly be listening very carefully to whatcanadians are saying with respect to more gun control.
So we will look at what the options are when it comes to introduce that bill when the appropriate time is with us.[end of translation] I have every intention of participatingin the vigils.
I know that many Canadians will want to express their solidaritywith those in Nova Scotia who are grieving.
I am very much open to moving forward with our gun control legislation.
I think there is always going to be questions of when is the right moment to do that.
We are in the middle of a different crisis right now, but with parliament returning in some fashion over the coming weeks, I think we will look at opportunities to do just that.[end of translation].



**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister of Canada giving his daily briefing, but today a different tone and message, primarily about the shooting that killed at least 18 people not including the shooter in Nova Scotia.
Let me bring in My colleagues Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
Vassy, over to you first.



**Vassy**:
Hey, Rosie On the comments of what happened in Nova Scotia, a number of different condolences offered by the Prime Minister.
He was asked interestingly if he was willing to relax any of the social distancing rules for those who will find it tough to mourn all of this and grieve all of this from their homes rather than getting together.
He talked about how difficult it would be from a public health standpoint.
He said there is going to be a virtual vigil.
Some things that stood out for me on this subject were questions, first of all, whether or not the subject was on the federal government's radar or onagencies' radar.
He didn't at this point have an answer about that.
I don't know to what degree the suspect might have been.
That is a pertinent question, given the severity of these actions.
As we learn more about the motive and about what happened, those kinds of questions will persist.
He was also asked how he felt and what his reaction was upon learning that the suspect was almost obsessed with the RCMP.
Had dressed up and taken cars and things like that.
He didn't really respond necessarily to that, but kept pointing out that there is a lot more to learn and put focus back on the victims of course where all of our thoughts are on the severity of the crime.
He was also asked about gun control legislation.
Again, it's difficult to know because there are so few details about motive and about how this all unfolded at this point whether or not that would have made a difference, but those questions are interesting because the government had been promising gun control legislation for a number of months.
My understanding the last conversation about it was that something was expected this spring.
They had been promising it right through the election campaign.
They did a consultation last April so about a year ago.
There were calls for people who wanted more to bring that legislation in sooner.
I notice the Prime Minister said they still intend to, but once this pandemic thing is over.
That gives us an indication when that might happen.
a number of policy-oriented questions and intelligence questions associated with what we've seen unfold in Nova Scotia.
Not a lot of answers because there are so few details at thismoment.



**Rosemary**:
Borrowing a page from the Prime Minister of new Zealand ardern, when she called on media to do the same thing the Prime Minister said here, not to show the photo or say the name of the killer in the media.



**David**:
For the second time in2020 we've seen him leaning into the symbolism of his foal as Prime Minister to comfort people in a time of great tragedy.
Iran flight 752 was just over a hundred days ago.
The stark difference between then and now is just how much COVID-19 is robbing people the ability to go to rituals and milestones and seeking cold front from their loved ones.
and being asked if we can relax things to allow that to happen.
There is an acute focus on these18 murders, because as the killer went door to door, the police today are going door to door and making terrible and horrible discoveries.
He pivoted to the point that it's not just -- it's people who are dying of cancer, people who are dying of heart disease, people dying of the ordinary run-of-the-mill things we see each year and the total inability of families to find comfort and seek relief from their grief with loved ones and gatherings and how difficult that is. This is why when he's asking thepolitical questions, he says I don't want to be bickering or arguing with anyone on this.
It does seem there's going to bean agreement by the end of the day to sit in person once a weekand supplement that with virtualsittings.
On fundamental issues of life and death, nothing is working asit should because of this.
Everything from parliament on down have to find ways to adapt.



**Rosemary**:
Thank you for this.
I will come back to you if I have time.
I wanted to go to colchester where we are speaking to Lenora the M.P. there.



**Interview**:
Thank you, Rosie



**Rosemary**:
How did you find out what was unfolding in Portapique, I guess late Saturday



**Interview**:
I didn't hear anything about it until yesterday morning.
The government did give me a call to let me know that there was an active shooter and I should let My constituents know.
So I immediately went to twitter and retweeted some of the stuff the RCMP were saying.
At that point in time he was still on the loose and we were telling people to make sure they locked their doors and if they saw a gentleman with his description, not to go anywhere near him, that he was armed and dangerous.
Not quite the type of thing you would expect to wake up to on a Sunday morning in the middle of a sleepy little town, in the middle of COVID-19 shutdown, where everyone is in their home s. Within an hour or an hour and a half I found out that he had been apprehended and shortly after that we heard that he was deceased.



**Rosemary**:
Tell us a little bit some of those communities.
We were talking to Brett Ruskin Portapique is cottage country and these are small towns where people would know each other I would imagine?



**Interview**:
Oh, yes.
As the Prime Minister said, we all know each other here.
Where you live in Portapique or Debert or shubenacadie, we are all related, cousins, sisters, brothers, husbands, wives.
So many, many, many of us know people who know people who are definitely involved and their family members have been affected.
Many people were looking for loved ones yesterday, putting up their pictures saying, have you seen them?they live in Portapique.
I can't get ahold of them.
and Wentworth is another area.
Sadly I found out that a number of those folks they were lookingfor are deceased.



**Rosemary**:
Some of the names and the stories of the people that were killed are starting to emerge today.
We heard the Prime Minister say there, Lenore that it's up to 18 people that were killed.
How do you react to that knowing that these are your people in some ways?



**Interview**:
I mean, obviously it's really heart breaking.
People are in shock.
We're still in shock right now.



**Rosemary**:
Sure.



**Interview**:
Some people are starting to mourn, but the mourning is going to go on for some time, I believe, as the shock waves keep growing and more and more people realize who was killed and basically senselessly.
I know a lot of people are also saying we do not want to become known as, oh, the place where the biggest killing ever took place in Canada, mass killing.
We don't want to become known asthat.
We are a beautiful, quiet, peaceful part of the world and everybody is really very warm and kind and caring.
We prefer to be known and remembered as that, rather than some place where this horrific thing has happened.



**Rosemary**:
You spoke to the Prime Minister yesterday.
What was he able to say to you that was helpful or to the community that they need to know?



**Interview**:
Basically he was very, very compassionate.
Very kind and understanding.
He wanted to know if there's anything that I need, understanding how difficult this is to go through.
Making sure I knew if our community needs anything, the government will be there.
Today he came on the phone with all of us, with the entire nova scotian liberal caucus and basically said the same thing.
It's nice to have a leader who is kind and compassionate and understanding and takes the time to do this with his members and anyone else who has been affected.
I know My community appreciates it and we appreciate the outpouring of love from across Canada to be honest.
We're very moved by that.



**Rosemary**:
We only have identified a number of the victims, so if there's some that we haven't, maybe we won't get into names, but do you personally know any of the 18 people that lost their lives?



**Interview**:
I don't know all of the names myself yet, but I know who some of them are and I have friends who are friends of those people.
I also have friends who knew the gunman who contacted me and saidthey're in a state of shock because they went to school withhim.
They've known him since he was 16. He was such a nice guy.
They talked to him all the time.
He seemed to be fine.
Another friend said that the gentleman drove into his brother's yard in a car on Sunday and they had a few words and he seemed normal and drove off and said he was having a drive.
So, you know, as the RCMP said, this is an ongoing investigation.
Because there are so many places where the crimes took place, it's going to be very interesting.
It's like a jig-saw puzzle and trying to pull those pieces together.
It's going to be interesting, but it's heart breaking for us on the ground.



**Rosemary**:
You heard the Prime Minister get the question about whether physical distancing should be relaxed for some of the families involved in this.
I understand completely that everyone across the country, there have been more than 1, 600 deaths related to COVID-19 and then deaths due to other illnesses and accidents.
All those people are having to do funerals and memorials without being in attendance.
But I wonder if because of the violence and the magnitude of this incident, whether you think there should be some ability for people to, in some safe way, come together to feel things together as a community.



**Interview**:
Well, I think for one thing that would be up to the premier of Nova Scotia I would imagine, but the thing is I wouldn't want to go to a funeral thinking that perhaps I might spread a disease to somebody else and have more deaths because of My involvement.
I think we have to think of the bigger picture of all of us and protecting all nova Scotians and all Canadians.
That's why we are doing what we're doing and sacrificing our lives and jobs and everything by staying home.
So there are going to be vigils.
There are going to be online vigils.
I know there is one on Friday night at 7:00 on Facebook that communities -- colchester supporting our community is the name of that Facebook page.
That's a community-led vigil.
I'm going to take part in that and that's what I would do.



**Rosemary**:
Do you recognize how difficult this is because of the fact we're in the pandemic, even for yourself personally, the fact that we're so disconnected from people?



**Interview**:
I definitely do. We're all on Facebook We're not a Twitter-verse here in cumberland and colchester.
Most of us are of an age where we prefer facebook.
We are actually reaching out andtalking to each other.
a number of friends have posted things where they're broken-hearted because it's their family members and they can't go and see them.



**Rosemary**:
Lenore zann, thank you for taking the time.
Nova Scotia M.P. lenore zann.
We are all thinking about you and your riding.



**Interview**:
Thank you very much from Nova Scotia.
We love you.
Thank you.
