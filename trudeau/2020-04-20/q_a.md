**Question**:
Mr. Prime Minister, conservative leader Andrew schemer accused you of being inflexible about the number of sittings in parliament.
I wonder if there's any room fora compromise, two sittings per week, given that moving forward may be preferable to no deal at all?



**Answer**:
Look, I don't want to get into arguments with anyone today.
We are working together amongst all parties to try to figure outta way to both protect and uphold our democracy to ensure that there is proper accountability, while at the same time doing that responsibly.
I'm hopeful we will be able to come to an appropriate arrangement.

**Question**:
I was wondering if we could have an accounting of all of the ways that the opposition has been kept informed of the ongoing crisis and the government's actions outside of the house to date.



**Answer**:
As I said, we have been engaged with all parties over the course of the pandemic.
There have been many good ideas brought forward by business leaders, community groups, individual Canadians, but also by MP's from their communities about what is needed to help.
We are trying to make sure we are giving Canadians the help they need to get through this difficult time and we will continue to do that.

**Question**:
Hello,  Prime Minister.
I have a question for you regarding navigating Canada through this crisis.
Obviously you're leading this g7country through this pandemic and you've also been personally impacted by this.
I'm wondering, how would you saythis  has impacted your governing style as a leader and your perception of your role as a Prime Minister?



**Answer**:
I think one of the things we've seen right across the country is how Canadians have pulled together through this difficult time, and that's something we've always done.
We make sure we're there for each other when we encounter.
We've seen Canadians step up for each other.
The privilege of being able to serve Canadians through this difficult time is really quite something when you see just how Canadians are resolute in their desire to support each other through this.
Obviously the capacity to work across all orders of government, work together as a country, is what is keeping US on a good path through this.
There are too many tragedies to name going on as people lose loved ones right across the country, but at the same time we know that what we are doing is helping prevent further tragedies.
We're going to continue to do that.



ON A FOLLOW-UP, KATE.

**Question**:
How would you say -- how would you describe your strategy?what has it been in terms of inside the p. M.o. Office to getting US through these tough times and how would you say -- how would you assess your own performance on that?



**Answer**:
Our focus every step of the way has been listening to the best advice from experts and scientists on what we need to do to keep Canadians safe in this and to ensure that everything we're doing is giving Canadians the comfort and confidence that we're all in this together and that we are going to be there for each.
I think that is key to making sure people are able to self-isolate and are able to take the difficult measures necessary to get US through thispandemic,  know as a country, as systems, and as government, we're there for each other and making sure that Canadians have support and know that we will get through this together, that has been key in getting through this together.

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] good morning,  Trudeau.
I understand that you don't really want to talk about parliament at this time, but I do have to discuss this with you in spite of that.
I would like you to comment on your impression of what citizens are thinking looking at what's happening in Ottawa right now.
People are at home and have been there for more than a month now.
We are seeing what's happening with this pandemic.
and now parliament is resuming in person because a number of political parties can't agree.
What do you think citizens are thinking to themselves in seeing this today?



**Answer**:
Well, I think citizens understand that it is important, not because of the crisis or in spite of the crisis, but that we continue to defend our institutions in parliament and to do that responsibly.
I think it's important to continue to have questions and to talk about the measures that will help Canadians.
We are proposing various ways of working together responsibly  Most of the parties agree and I know that there will be further discussions today to try and figure out what the process should be and how we could defend our democratic principle sand institutions.

**Question**:
There is some parties -- well, one party, the bloc quÉbÉcois, which is accusing the conservatives of holding parliament hostage.
I'd like to have you comment on that characterization of the current situation.
I'd also like to hear you comment on the idea of a compromise in the sense that there is one party demanding three in-person sittings per week.
You don't agree.
and if you don't agree, there will be five.
That would seem to be worse based on your current perspective, where you're sayingnow  should be almost none.
Do you not think it would be better to negotiate and try to agree on three sittings rather than being stuck with five?



**Answer**:
I do not want to get involved in any partisan bickering today.
I don't think that's something Canadians want to see.
Canadians do want to know that we are doing our job and defending our institutions and continuing to allow our parliament to function in the midst of a crisis so that we're asking the right questions and getting the right answers.
I am very confident that today we will be able to agree on a approach that will ensure the continuity of our parliamentary institutions in this difficult time, but also be able to do that in a responsible way.

**Question**:
Yes, good morning,  Trudeau.
Will your government be introducing legislation to tighten up gun control, given what has just happened in Nova Scotia?



**Answer**:
Well, obviously there are many, many questions now and there is an investigation to be conducted as to what exactly happened in Nova Scotia.
I don't want to draw any conclusions yet, but there will be a commitment in terms of tightening up gun control.
We were to the point where we would have introduced legislation to ban assault weapons in this country.
We will bring forward those measures again as soon as we have an opportunity to do so once we have come through COVID-19.

**Question**:
Yes.
In quÉbec this morning, construction workers have gone back to their construction sites.
Now, is your government in support of this measure being taken in quÉbec and across the country potentially?



**Answer**:
Well, I think that the various jurisdictions are making their own decisions within their field of jurisdiction.
I think it's up to each region and province to determine what can be done at what time.
We are trying to coordinate these actions right across the country, but of course the decisions will be different from one place to the other.
and of course it is absolutely critical that whatever decisions are made, the health and safety of workers and all Canadians to avoid the further spread of COVID-19 must be the top priority if we're talking about any type of work starting up again.[end of translation].

**Question**:
You promised a ban on assault-style weapons.
Given what we know about the shooting in Nova Scotia, could that have prevented these crimes?if not, would you consider even tighter gun-control measures?



**Answer**:
As we know, this is very much an ongoing investigation that is in its early stages in Nova Scotia right now.
So I don't want to jump to conclusions or make characterizations about what happens until we get a full accounting from the authorities.
But in regards to gun control, we took very serious commitments in the election campaign and are moving forward on them to make sure we're strengthening gun control in this country.
I can say we were on the verge of introducing legislation to ban assault-style weapons acrossthe  It was interrupted when the pandemic caused parliament to besuspended.
 have ever intention of movingforward  that measure and potentially other measures when the parliament returns.

**Question**:
Would you return of relaxing some physical distancing measures to allow the people in Nova Scotia to bury their loved ones properly?



**Answer**:
I think that's a reflection that communities, that the province, and that all of US are going to have to have.
We understand how incredibly painful it is for families who've lost loved ones in Nova Scotia this past day to imagine that they're not going to be able to see them off together as a community.
But at the same time, there are thousands and thousands of Canadians across the country who've lost loved ones to COVID-19 over the past days and others WHO lost family members to cancer and to other causes WHO haven't been able to gather, to mourn, to grieve, to attend funerals.
This is something that we are dealing with right now that is heart break on top of other heart breaks.
and I know that everyone will be looking for ways to demonstrate their solidarity without putting further at risk communities, first  our health professionals, and our seniors.[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] I recognize that there are people WHO have lost loved ones in this past day or so in Nova Scotia.
There are also people WHO have lost family members and friends or parents in the recent weeks because of COVID-19.  have been unable to come together for funerals or to mourn together.
This is a difficult situation made even worse in times of lossand  But we must continue to try to be there for each other in thesetragic  and ensure that we are not creating greater risk for our loved ones, our neighbours, our first responders,  healthcare workers.
We need to do everything we can to keep people safe and healthy, even in the midst of this tragedy and pandemic.[end of translation].

**Question**:
Prime Minister, was the Nova Scotia shooter on the federal government's radar?were any federal agencies watching him?



**Answer**:
There are many questions people are asking about what happened and that investigation and the RCMP will be sharing details as they can and choose in the coming days.
There will be many opportunities to talk about this once we have a clearer idea of the facts.

---

**Question**:
What did you think when you learned about the degree of planning in this terrible crime?does it concern you someone could create such a good fake?



**Answer**:
I think as we learn more about this we'll have to ask ourselves many questions about how it happened and what we can do to keep communities safe in the future.
My first thoughts when I heard of this tragedy yesterday and saw the numbers climb in terms of victims, My first thought was for nova  WHO for the most part know each other so much.
They are such a connected group that I know the vast majority of nova Scotians will have a direct link with one or more of the many victims.
The entire province and the entire country is grieving right now as we come to grips with something that is absolutely unimaginable.

**Question**:
Kevin  CTV news.
Prime Minister, as we're talking about the tragedy in nova  Canadians living under strict public health guidelines, how appropriate is it to bring back parliament.
Why can't your government reach a deal on this?



**Answer**:
I'm very hopeful that over the course of the day Canadians will see parliamentarians coming together to demonstrate that our democracy is strong, that our institutions need to function, including during difficult times, indeed because of the difficult time we're going through, but that we can do so in a responsible way.
As I've said, there is agreement amongst most of the parties in the house of commons.
I hope to see by the end of this day that we're all in a place where we can both have our parliamentary institutions functioning, but doing so in a responsible way, given the context we're in.[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] I do hope that between now and the end of the day, we will have found a way ofensuring  our parliament is functioning, that our democracy is functioning.
We will have to see.
We do have the agreement of a number of parliamentarians.
We will find the right solution in order to continue to sit as aparliament  given thecurrent  of translation].

---

**Question**:
What responsibility does your government take for not having this deal in place?



**Answer**:
I think it's all of our collective responsibility todo the best we can through this difficult situation.
It is really important to me that we continue to uphold our democracy, the democratic principles, the principles of accountability, the ability to move forward with new legislation to help Canadians.
That really matters, but it really matters that we do so responsibly, that we have agreement amongst most parties.
I'm hopeful that by the end of the day today we'll have a clear path forward that will both defend our institutions and appreciate the context that we're in right now.

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] radio-Canada.
Good morning, mr.  I understand that there are questions that will be asked formany  to come about what happened in Nova Scotia, but My question is more about Canada ingeneral.
 is it that in 2020 we are still seeing mass shootings likethis?



**Answer**:
Well, this is a tragic situation that reminds us that unfortunately there is still gun violence in this country.
We have taken steps to try and strengthen gun control in Canada, but we must do more.
We have pledged to do more and we will do more.
We need to make sure Canadians can live in safety, in their communities, in their streets, and that's what we will continue to work on together.

**Question**:
Now, will you be participating in that ceremony and could you introduce your gun control bill in the coming weeks?parliament will be sitting, so you could introduce it as early as this week.



**Answer**:
Yes, I intend to participate in the virtual vigil as much as possible.
We will most certainly be listening very carefully to  are saying with respect to more gun control.
So we will look at what the options are when it comes to introduce that bill when the appropriate time is with us.[end of translation] I have every intention of participatingin  vigils.
I know that many Canadians will want to express their solidaritywith  in Nova Scotia WHO are grieving.
I am very much open to moving forward with our gun control legislation.
I think there is always going to be questions of when is the right moment to do that.
We are in the middle of a different crisis right now, but with parliament returning in some fashion over the coming weeks, I think we will look at opportunities to do just that.[end of translation].
