We are standing by to bring you the Prime Minister's briefin
This is not like another briefin
Nova Scotians are trying to come to terms with a mass shooting, gunman killing at least 16 peopl
We're hearing more about the victims, their names, their storie
a RCMP constable, a grade schoolteacher, a volunteer firefighter, and a nurse among the dea
We are expecting an update from Nova Scotia at 2:00 local tim
We are expecting the Prime Minister to address this today as well, but because of the nature of this story and how important it is, we will start in Nova Scoti
Brett Ruskin and tom Murphy  Brett is in Portapique where this all began, but we'll start with tom in Halifax for the latest on what we kno


**TOM**:
We're expecting an rcmpbriefing in a couple of hours now to shed more light on what happene
We're hearing of more victim
The count is up to 17 including the kille
You mentioned the occupations of some of those peopl
Just devastatin
People woke up in Nova Scotia wondered if this was a drea
is this going to be ove
People are trying not to let this define them, saying they'regoing to help families who are feeling the pain and give them virtual hu
The RCMP have been scant with the detail
They are still trying to piece together the crime scenes, and there are multiple crime scenes across Nova Scotia, which makes it complicate
There were house fires in  where Brett is, and we learned that three people died in that locatio
Little bits and pieces like that are starting to come throug
We're learning more about the personalities and the people behind the deadly stats her


**Rosemary**:
What do we know more about the second shooter, who is also dea
What more do we know about him or his interactions or connections to the communit


**TOM**:
He's a myster
People in his community of Portapique where he lived and  where he had a  people liked hi
They felt he was a good community perso
There is the other side of him that is being expose
This is a guy who had a penchant for old police car
He used to buy them and fix  He had an RCMP car that was fake but he was driving it and he also had RCMP clothin
This all points to a premeditatio
In terms of what motivated him and why he did this, that is unanswere


**Rosemary**:
As we learn more about the shooter, we're also learning more about the victim
We know a veteran RCMP  Stevenson was also kille
What do we know?



**TOM**:
Heidi Stevenson was a 23-year veteran of the RCM
She was at one point the face of the RCMP in this provinc
She would do interviews for the RCM
I know some people from the media know her and there has been some reaction coming in about how important she was in people's lives in this part of the provinc
We know three of the people who died in the fire in  one of those was a corrections office
That's a loss that that professional community is feeling as wel
Two Victoria order nurses staff members, who were busy helping in the COVID-19 figh
They died as wel
and Lisa McCully who died and left behind a famil


**Rosemary**:
Tom  thank you for tha
Let me turn to Brett Ruskin who is in  It's a small communit
How are people dealing with things today as they start to understand the magnitude of 



**Brett**:
a small community indee
This is the police check-point that is set up her
Only residents being allowed in and ou
Investigators going in to begin the process of piecing together what happened at this scene, butit  all across the provinc
This really proves this type of thing could happen anywher
If it were to happen here, this is a quiet, not even a community, a neighbourhood, about 100 residents down this road, about a few dozen home
Nothing really happens her
Certainly not the types of things we have been seeing over the last 24 hours, police cars zooming in and out with swat team officers and large guns drawn, with huge structures ablaze in the middle of the nigh
This is not something you would typically expect from this communit
As for the other communities we've seen Wentworth,     are rural communities, farm land, you could drop them anywhere in the countr
They're small towns, tight-knit communities, everyone knows everyon
One of the things about the communities is police put out a notice in the middle of this emergency with the risk of an active shooter saying stay hom
Lock your doors, stay in the basement, many people I've spoken with say they never lock their door
This is taking this community byshoc


**Rosemary**:
Brett Ruskin in Portapique and tom  in  As Brett mentioned, the investigation is spanning over at least 50 kilometre
There is an RCMP briefing we are expecting that will be an important on
The Prime Minister is expected to give his daily briefing outside Rideau cottage in about eight minutes or s
We do expect him to spend a lot of time talking about what happened in Nova Scotia, given the magnitude of the traged
I want to show viewers the inside of the house of common
That's where I'll bring in My colleagues the host of "power & politics," Vassy  and David  In the midst of this it seems the house of commons has returned because there was no agreement between four of the parties and the conservatives todo something differen
This is also something that is preoccupying Ottawa right no
 what is the latest we know?



**Vassy**:
The latest I'm hearing is there will be a motion introduced by the liberal
and the nature of the tension I should just say is over how many times they should be meetin
The liberals are offering once a week in person and then some virtual, supplemental session
The DP and the bloc quÉbÉcois are supportive of that in various form
The conservatives are arguing for more in-person sessions withreduced   My understanding is the liberalswill  a motion with that plan in plan, one that the rest of the parties agree t
It might take up most of the dayand  there will be some kindof  on i
All of that is subject to chang
As you've been reporting, rosi
 fluctuated minute to minuteand  to hour, and also set against the backdrop of everything you've been talking abou
Difficult to I guess see the sort of benefits of all this arguing right no
I think that -- expect some sortof  between most of thepartie
 not sure this will continue much beyond that, but who know


**Rosemary**:
It does in the light of the pandemic, which we continue to cove
That's obviously affecting the entire countr
and now the killing of 16 people in a mass shooting in Nova Scoti
It becomes a little difficult I think for politicians in moments like thes
It's not that it's not important to have accountability inside the hous
It's in light of the other things happening, the arguments are a little more difficult to mak
David, your perspectiv


**David**:
It's interestin
Andrew schemer has been like an auctioneer going in revers
He wanted five days a week and now he's down to three days a wee
That has been the compromise that the other parties have agreed t
The greens don't want any session unless there is a vot
The bloc is content to have rules of engagement so they don't have to go through this every time they have to come bac
Yves-franÇois blanchet  the conservatives of holding them hostag
While there's an obsession here about the numbers of sittings and the numbers of hours of question period, I think the country might be worried about other numbers, 3
000 cases of COVID-19, and 16 deaths in Nova Scotia due to a shootin
In the times we're in, no funerals or wake
This is a time when the Prime Minister and other dignitaries would travel to Nova Scotia to offer comfort in a time like this, and none of that is happening because of what's going o
It makes it difficult to argue that politics as much as you canneeds  continue in parliament with as many as three sittings a wee
Andrew scheer  if MPs  go to a grocery store, they can come her
But what are we told about tha
Go once a wee
and you don't need to get on a plane from vancouver  ottawa  buy your grocer
It looks like the majority is going to get its way with the motion that is going to be presented and voted o


**Rosemary**:
I will say, I did go to bed last night thinking they would reach an agreement in light of the things you've mentioned, the times we're in and the gravity of what we're dealing with no
That doesn't appear to have happene
I don't think all the parties believe that parliament should have some role to play, that there should be some attempt to be able to hold the government to account and answer some question
That is a vital part of our democrac
It's just like on a day like today quibbling about the hours and the times, it becomes a little bit difficult to talk about the importance of tha
There is an importance to it, it becomes a legitimate concer
 I'll get you to weigh in as we continue to wait for the Prime Ministe


**Vassy**:
At the heart of all of this is like you and David point out a desire for accountabilit
There's evidence that that accountability has worked over the past month, righ
There's lots of legislation that the government has introduced that has some holes that the opposition parties pointed ou
They went back and got agreemen
I think the disagreement is how that accountability should be  There are some saying they don'twant anything in person and they feel saf
Some are saying there should be more MP's than are there no
I think it's hard for people sitting at home watching the horror in Nova Scotia unfold, who are living the reality of  There is a need for accountabilit
I wouldn't disagree with that especially as a journalis
The contention from the conservatives is that the Prime Minister is answering questions every day, why isn't he in the hous
He should be open to receiving those questions from the oppositio
It sounds like what was being proposed is different than norma
There would be a few hours of accountabilit
There is a question mark over how this virtual thing would g
If it would be effectiv
We've seen examples of things right across the country of things not workin
You would have thought much of this would have occurred in negotiations behind the scene
Instead, we'll see this play out in the house of commons toda
Maybe there will be an agreement and they will vote on i
Certainly not the first thing onpeople's minds right no


**Rosemary**:
I think that's fair to sa
I agree with all of your point
We will see if the Prime Minister is asked about it and whether there is any sign from him if we are closer to a dea
There is a necessity for politics and politicians to be playing their important roles right no
But how that looks and what that looks like is still being  As we stand by to wait for the Prime Minister and his daily briefing which is usual his government's response to the COVID-19 pandemi
Today we are told it will be about around what happened in Nova Scoti
Not surprisingl
He did address it yesterday  just offering his thanks to first res ponders and people for following instructions, but at that time the scale of what had happened was not well understoo
The RCMP has not confirmed the number of deaths nor had they confirmed that one of their own had falle
There will be other things for the Prime Minister to say toda
We are expecting of course to hear from public safety minister bill Blair a little bit later as well as of course the Nova Scotia RCM
Just to remind you what we are dealing with in terms of number sand what happened in Nova Scotia, it started to unfold Saturday nigh
The shooter now believed to have taken out at least 16 people and he himself was also killed when he was taken into custody is  Let me go back to David if I ca
