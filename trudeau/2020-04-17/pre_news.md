I'm rosemary  Thank you for joining us on  CBC news network, or streaming around the worl
We are, as we do at this time of day, standing by to hear from Prime Minister Justin  He is expected today to respond to some of the urgent appeals to support various industries across Canad
For weeks, as his government has been rolling out emergency aid for Canadian businesses and worker
The Prime Minister has also been promising second -- sect oral help by certain industries that have been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 shutdow
Let me bring in My colleagues as we stand by and wait for the Prime Ministe
The host of "power & politics", Vassy  and   I don't think this is an oil and gas announcement from what I'm hearin
But there will be components that will help Alberta and other place


**Vassy**:
Yeah, and I'll tell you why I think we've all been asking various people in government, is this going to be targeted,  to oil and ga
Back at the end of march, I think it was the  or  bill  said help for the oil patch would be coming in hours or day
That didn't materializ
There is sort of a double whammy when it comes to the oil patch right no
Not just because of COVID-19 and decreased demand for oil, much decreased demand, but also this price war that emerged between Russia and Saudi Arabia that kind of got resold last week, but didn't really end up buoying oil price
They're at all-time low
a barrel of canadian  was selling for less than $
The idea was -- or the question raised to the government is going to be is there specific help for the sector?and what might that help look like?there's been two specific asks for i
The first is orphan well
These are sites that the company ended up going broke and didn't clean u
It's estimated the cleanup of those sites could cost billions of dollars, upwards of $8 billion, one assessment put out ther
The Alberta government has announced that some money would be directed to i
There is the expectation that the federal government will chip in on that endeavou
I don't know to what degre
The second big ask, particularly from industry, is around liquidity for producers that have had to shelve capital projects, for example, or are trying to keep employees on the payrol
There is the wage subsidy that they can access, but they also asked for help with liquidit
It will be interesting to see that part of the announcemen
There are indications so far that there this won't necessarily be, you know, a big package targeted specifically at the oil sector, that there is also an announcement coming from the Prime Minister that would be aimed at helping people who the CERB or the  business loan have missed and we have certainly heard from a lot of those peopl
Think of some musicians, for example, or others in the culture secto
That kind of thin
I'm going to be looking to see what announcement that involves but there are people looking for sector-specific help and to what degree will this announcement address tha


**Rosemary**:
Yea
It does not sound like a, quote-unquote, bailout for oil and gas toda
There will be some sort of measures there as you suggested to help them alon
But it will be, from what we're hearing anyway, a much broad way of helping different industries that have been hit in different ways and you alluded to the cultural sector, but tourism is an example and there are certainly other
Are we expecting that -- it should be fairly substantive, I would guess, too, talking about many sectors and many ministers showing up at the noon press conferenc


**Reporter**:
Yea
We're hearing it is across multiple sectors and that has been the focus from the government from the git-g
As Vassy  bill more know did talk about help for the oil and gas sector coming within hour
That was three long weeks ag
Whenever the government has been talking about this, they have been framing it as help for multiple vulnerable industrie
As you mentioned, tourismt  sector as well and the focus has been on worker
So, getting people back working on thi
We are hearing regional developments will play a part in this, in terms of, as Vassy Was mentioning, what certain areas are really feeling more particularly -- you know, certain tourism -- the focus on tourism, people aren't going on tour buses and people aren't, you know, signing up to go into museums and whatno
So, it is really the focus on workers and that in particular across a broad spectrum of sectors that are really hard hit by thi


**Rosemary**:
and one of the things that the government has said is that the first priority was to get money to individuals and the second was to get help to businesses and now we're broadening out to larger industrie
Ab don't know if that includes even the airline industry, which, as we know, is what's happening to the wage subsidy benefit, which is not working yet, up and running ye
But maybe they also are looking for some substantive mone
I'm going to -- I'll come back to both of yo
While we wait to hear more from the Prime Minister about these details of various industries, Vassy talked a little bit there about what could happen in doing to help Alberta 
Let us go to Alberta to talk about what they are asking for because we know that the economy has been hit very har
Not only by oil prices, but also the pandemi
a double whammy in that part of the countr
and Jason kenned has said that it's possible that employment there -- the unemployment rate hits 25%, which would be just astoundin
The cbc's Carolyn Dunn joins me from  All right,  I know you talked to people in the industry regularly and there have been a lot of ask
It doesn't sound like this is the big, big package that they maybe were looking fo
But there will be something her


**Reporter**:
I think that is what I'm watching fo
Are we going -- is this going to be parceled out of the giant industry package or are we going to start out smaller today and kind of [inaudible] with those big announcements with airlines, et
What Alberta is asking for is very clear.$20 to $30 billion packag
Likely a lot of that will be around liquidity, you know, around backstopping credit, around low-interest loans, that kind of thin
and you mentioned the fallout for workers, an unemployment rate of up to 25% or beyond, which is astoundin
and I guess for industry, if they don't get immediate help with their liquidity, they will be losing oil and gas companies, guarantee
But even, you know, it is good to accelerate and it could even be the big on
We are also hearing from industry that they would like the see a freeze in the carbon tax as well as a delay in, you know, climate and collusion regulations, which is coming under some criticism as perhaps the industry using this pandemic crisis, you know, to kind of get through the backdoor what it couldn't get through the beginning, through the front doo
But what's really interesting is that orphan well package and I expect that we hear from the Prime Minister today on tha
There are more than 15
000 orphaned wells in Albert
Those are wells that have been abandon and they're not being service
So just sitting, wrecking farmer's fields, reall
and a it would be, you know, billions of dollars, perhaps $8 billion to remediate  What it might mean at this time is sort of a double whammy that would put oil workers back to work cleaning those up and get them cleaned u
Normally it would come under a lot of criticism that taxpayers will be paying to clean up the mess that oil companies lef
But these are not normal times as you kno
So if there is some help for orphan wells, it could actually help the industry by keeping people working and deal with a real environmental problem here in Albert


**Rosemary**:
Yea
It would do a couple of things all at once, that's for sur
Thank you for tha
You'll stand by in case we need to get back to yo
Carolyn Dunn in  As we wait for the Prime Minister, expected in about seven minutes, let me go to Kathy duk
She is CEO Of destination s
John's, the agency that works hard to bring in visitors to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and like all places across this country, it is a tough challenge in these difficult times because tourism and visiting places isn't really something that is happenin
Kathy, good to see yo


THANK YOU FOR HAVING M


**Rosemary**:
a pleasur
How are things there?obviously your industry, what you're doing isn't happening right no


**Caller**:
Absolutel
The impact of COVID-19 on our tourism here in Newfoundland and Labrador has really been devastatin
The tourism industry is really important to the provinc
We have maybe 2
000 people working in the industry and maybe 2500 small businesse
The organization that I work for, destination s
John's, represents s
John's regio
and we certainly have felt it her
Many of our hotels are close
Which is amazing that that could happe
and it is happening across the countr
Restaurants and pubs, retails and businesses on water street are closed and they're all very, very worried that they may not be around when the tourism industry start


**Rosemary**:
I imagine you do pretty well in normal time


SURE.WELL, [INAUDIBLE] ABOUT $1.3 BILLION.IN S
JOHN'S, WE REALLY DEPEND ON THE BUSINESS.FOR EXAMPLE, IN MEETINGS AND CONVENTIONS, WE MAY DO 100 CONVENTIONS A YEAR AND THAT WOULD BRING IN $450 MILLION JUST IN THAT SECTOR IN S
JOHN'S.SO IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICAN


**Rosemary**:
So what could the government do or what have you been asking the government to do that would be of help for this particular industry and obviously you're just one example, but this is happening across the countr


YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.THINK THAT THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY WAS THE FIRST INDUSTRY HIT AND HIT THE HARDEST.WITH THE COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF TRAVEL, IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE THE  IMPACT AND THAT'S HAD A RIPPLE EFFECT TO OTHER BUSINESSS THAT SERVE OUR TRAVELERS WHEN THEY COME TO OUR DESTINATION.WE'RE WORKING WITH THE TOURISM INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF CANADA AND PUTTING TOGETHER SOME OF THESE IDEAS TO BE PRESENTED TO GOVERNMENT.I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES WON'T EVEN BE AROUND WHEN OUR TOURISM SEASON STARTS AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT RECOVERY PLAN, THAT MARKETING RECOVERY PLAN.SO I THINK THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 75% WAGE  SUBSIDY IS WONDERFUL, BUT FOR MANY OF OUR TOURISM OPERATORS, THEY NEED THAT [INAUDIBLE] IN THE SUMMER.THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE UNIQUE, IF YOU WILL, TO THE TOURISM INDUSTRY THAT WE NEED TO SEE WITH EXTENDED PROGRAMMES AROUND THOS


**Rosemary**:
The Prime Minister is talking about weeks still of having to live under these very strict public health restriction
Can this happen still for weeks or is there any pressure coming from any of your members to get the economy up and running again?



OH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IF WE HAD OUR [INAUDIBLE], WE WOULD START TOMORROW, OF COURSE.THE TOURISM INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES THAT WE WORK WITH REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHEN THINGS ARE GOING TO TURN AROUND.AND I THINK [INAUDIBLE].IT MAY START JULY OR AUGUST.OTHERS THE FOLLOWING SUMMER SAYING THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY VISITATION UNTIL 2021.WE DO KNOW THAT AS TRAVEL COMES BACK, IT WILL BE MOSTLY DOMESTIC TRAVELERS AND THAT IS GOOD FOR NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR IN THAT 80% OF OUR VISITORS HAVE TRADITIONALLY COME FROM CANADA.SO WE REALLY IMMEDIATE TO BE TARGETED TO THE TRAVELER.WE UNDERSTAND THAT [INAUDIBLE] DRIVE RATHER THAN FLY AND PUTS A HUGE EMPHASIS ON SPACE, SOCIAL DISTANCING, PLANES.SO I THINK ALL OF OUR TOURISM OPERATORS WHO HAVE TO RETHINK WHO THE TRAVELER IS.IT WILL COST US A LOT MORE TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR INDIVIDUAL TRAVELER THAN WE DID IN THE PAS


**Rosemary**:
All righ
Cathy  I will happily come back to water street anytime I can get ther
Sending your province all the bes
Thank you very muc
Appreciate i


THANK YO


**Rosemary**:
 Cathy duke, CEO Of destination s
John's, agency of tourism for that province which, of course, is another sector that has been hit har
Just to give you a sense of how bad things are, and then I'll bring in  the accommodation and food services sector in this country has shrunk by a  Arts and culture lost 13% of all its job
Education, 9%.wholesale and retail trade lost 7%.the only place that continues to add some jobs, other than grocery stores and essential services work would be agricultur
Nearly 
000 jobs there created as obviously the reliance on the domestic food chain becomes more and more importan
I'll bring in My colleagues again and turn to you,  about it guess the ways in which the government has tried to shore up suppor
and how this might be different given that there are particular areas, of course, that are basically not functioning anymor


**Vassy**:
Yea
I think we've seen the unveiling and rolling out of two giant financial aid packages, right?the first being directed at individuals who have to stay home because of COVID-19,  can't work, and who have lost most, if not all of their incom
They're getting right now $
000 and, as you reminded our viewers yesterday, they should be re-applying for the second month, which they might need that mone
That was the first ste
The second step was aimed at businesse
and it involves wage subsidies as well as this loan, this canadian emergency  accoun
Basically a $4
000 interest-free loan, a quarter of it can be forgive
They expanded the parameters yesterday to who can qualify for that loa
I I think they had 22
000 applications approved so far.$
8 billion worth of credi
So, the need is clear and it's evident
However, as  been discussing with carolyn and your  guest, there are certain sectors and the Prime Minister always -- I've noticed names in tande
Airlines, tourism and the I'll patch.-- oil patc
Those are clearly what the government has indicated and what we can discern from what we see in front of us as sectors, industries that are particularly hard hi
They're sort of suffering from double or triple whammie
So, you know, what we're looking towards here from the Prime Minister is beyond an acknowledgment that that is the cas
Some specifics about how the government plans to address the more acute needs in those industrie
and obviously we're paying close attention to the oil patch because there is -- it is set against the backdrop of a very different political discussio
and I think sort of tensions that existed prior to all of this between Alberta and the federal government and I think, you know, that factors into all of this, to a certain degre
We know about this discussion apparently happening at cabinet where there's pushback to subsidizing  oil patch to any degre
So I think it is something to keep our eye o
But as I said, I think what we really need to focus on is, if those are the industris that are  acutely feeling the pain right now, what is the remedy the government proposes here toda


**Rosemary**:
and I think  mentioned this, too, there are government agencies like the co-op or the atlantic  where federal money can be sort of distributed in a very quick wa
If there are particularly hard-hit areas, it is probably easier and faster for those agencies to be able to get it to people that need it rather than the federal government doing it centrally from ottaw
So  would expect some of that to be addressed here today as wel
I'll turn to shalima shivj
  Minister is running a few minutes lat
There are ongoing conversation around the Canada-US borde
We know that that suspension, the prevention to travel across the border except for essential workers, is set to expire next wee


**Reporter**:
That's righ
and there are discussions whether that would be extended or no
Those discussions are still ongoing, that obviously this situation, we're still in the midst of it in terms of this crisis and the health effects of thi
So t limited movement, of course, limited to only essential supplies, essential businesses across the Canada-US border set to -- there was always a deadline for it as most of these things and, of course, we're hearing that there are talks to extend that as we're still going through this and as we're still seeing effects and cases risin
We're hearing that is still an ongoing discussion and working on that with officials down in the United State


**Rosemary**:
and there had been concern after the president said earlier this week that the Canada-US border would be one of fastest to re-open and some interpretation that it was about to re-ope
That is not the case from the deputy Prime Minister that there will likely be an extension but they haven't actually reached that deal ye
That would be important, you're righ
Because the containment of the virus and seeing how Canada is doing at a time like this versus the United States, probably the last thing that anyone would want is open borders and start to see travel move agai
We're waiting for the Prime Minister as we do at this time of da
He is running a couple of minutes lat
That is Rideau cottage you  looking at liv
I'm sure you are familiar with it no
a couple other issues to keep your eye on toda
and we heard earlier from conservative leader and doctor sheer and that is the return of parliamen
It, too, was on a deadlin
All parties had agreed that it would be suspended until monday unless they  reach another agreement to continue that suspensio
As of now, there is no deal on, that eithe
and andrew scheer has   very hard to see in-person siting
He is asking  four times a wee
Doesn't sound like that is acceptable to the governmen
and it doesn't even sound like other partis are interested in  in and having MPs here in a  capacity for that many days of wee
But it is something that conservatives continue to pus
and for now, there is no dea
and if they don't get a deal by monday, which I imagine  will, we would be in a place where the house of commons would have to resum
Which obviously would fly in the face of public health directive
Another issue to keep your eye o
and I will bring in Vassy because there is  two-minute warnin
I don't know if I can do that much on My own.[laughter]maybe we'll just pick up on that issue that the conservatives are pushing very hard for increased accountability and increased questions to the government, which, you know, I totally ge
But I'm not sure that we are -- it doesn't sound like we're anywhere near close on a deal in terms of everyone agreeing that one or two or three times a week will actually happe


**Vassy**:
This is an interesting Ottawa scenario her
In the midst of all of this, that is understandable, I think, from both points of vie
The nexus of the disagreement seems to be how much in-person parliament should politicians be engaging i
As you mentioned, the conservatives want sitings  four times a wee
My understanding late yesterday is it looked like there might be some movement towards an agreement for a reduced number of siting
Maybe  a week and end up being a few hours and very much an accountability sessio
Maybe not like question period, but something that we've come to know as committee as the whol
The opposition getting a chances to ask questions of the government about the policies that they have rolled out and they plan to roll ou
The corresponding request is, well can they do that virtually?will they be able to do that virtually?the speaker's office, in particular, is working on some sort of plan to make that happe
For the opposition, they would like to continue some in perso
They say the virtual thing can be a companion piec
If it's not ready yet, there has to be something happening in perso
The government has put forward the idea that that virtual idea might work going forward, but to have those in-session sitings every single day, to  in person every single day doesn't really adhere to physical distancing rules from where they sit or doesn't speak to the sentiment behind physical distancing and then the message that they put fort


**Rosemary**:
Here's the Prime Minister of Canad
