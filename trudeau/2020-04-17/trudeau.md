**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
Over the past few weeks, the pandemic has created anxiety and uncertainty for all Canadians but some are going through an especially tough tim
COVID-19 has brought many industries to a halt and workers across the country are struggling as a resul
From the start, our goal as a government has been clear -- to help all Canadians get through these challenging time
As I've said many times before, we're here to support you, to lend you a helping hand when you need it mos
Across the country, Canadians are standing shoulder to shoulder and we're all in this togethe
Today, our government is announcing more help for workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, BC and Newfoundland and Labrado
We're also announcing more help for small businesses and more help for those who work in the arts, culture and sports sector
I'll start with the energy secto
Right now, workers and families are struggling because of things beyond their contro
Both the devastating effects of the pandemic and price war driven by foreign interests are a challeng
As a result, companies have had to slowdown or pause their operations, leaving too many people out of wor
To help these worker, our government will invest $
7 billion to clean up orphan and inactive wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and BC.these wells, which are no longer in use, can be detrimental not only to our environment, but to people's healt
Think of the farmer who can't go anything on his land because of an abandoned well a few steps away from his hom
Think of the small town or indigenous communities strugling  this issuthat  been festering for years or even decade
Cleaning them up will bring people back to work and help many landowners who have had these wells on their property for years but haven't been able to get them taken care of and the land restore
Our goal is to create immediate jobs in these provinces while helping companies avoid bankruptcy and supporting our environmental target
In Alberta alone, these investments will maintain 5200 job
We listened to the concerns of landowners, municipalities and indigenous commuters who want to make sure that the pollute or pay principle is strengthened and their voices are hear
I want to thank government of Alberta for working with us and listening to their concern
Our government will also establish a $750 million emission reduction fund with the focus on methane to create and maintain jobs through pollution reduction effort
This includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrado
This fund will primarily provide repayable contributions to firms to make them more competitive, reduce waste and pollution and most importantly protect job
Right now, many energy firms are experiencing a cash crunch so they don't have the funds to invest in technologies, to reduce emissions or fix methane leak
Today's announcement will allow for this kind of work to be done and create jobs people need during this difficult tim
Through the wells and methane initiatives, we estimate that we will maintain roughly 1
000 jobs across the countr
Just because we're in a health crisis doesn't mean we can neglect the environmental crisi
We're also working with BDC and EDC  expand credit support for at-risk medium-sized energy companis so they  maintain operations and keep employees.[speaking french].

Our government will be investing $
7 billion to clean up orphaned and abandoned wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbi
The goal is to create jobs for workers in the energy sector to avoid companies going bankrupt and support our environmental target
These wells, which are no longer used to produce oil may present a risk not only for our environment, but also for our healt
By cleaning them up, we will create jobs for worker
We will also help people who have these abandoned wells on their land and we are predicting that these funds will maintain electoral college $5200 jobs in Alberta alon
We develop this policy with the government of Alberta and municipal partners and I want to thank them for their contribution
Our government will also be setting up a $750 million fund to reduce emissions that will focus on pollution caused by methane in order to create and maintain job
Of that sum, $75 million will be allocated to oil and gas companies who work offshore, Newfoundland and Labrador, to reduce their emission
This fund will provide for repayable contributions to companies in order to protect jobs, increase their competitiveness and reduce pollutio
Right now, energy sector companies have cash flow problems, which means that they don't have the necessary money to invest in technologies that help to reduce emissions or repair methane leak
Today's announcement will allow these companies to carry out that work while, at the same time, creating jobs for workers during this difficult tim
This public health crisis must not prevent us from taking action to fight the climate crisi
With this  to clean up the wells and the fund to reduce emissions, we believe that 1
000 jobs will be maintaine
At the same time, we're working with BC and EDUC To strengthen credit support for medium-sized energy companies that are particularly at ris
Once again, the goal is to allow these companies to continue their activity in order to keep their employee
