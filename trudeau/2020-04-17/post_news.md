**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking tocanadians on a daily update in the government's fight againstcovid-19. Another huge amount of money to help different Canadians in different sectors in this country.
and I'll bring in Vassy kapelosand salimah shivji to muddle through what we heard there, because there's a lot of it, andwe're waiting for a federal briefing as well.
Let me just say this part thatquÉbec did ask for additional help from the federal government and that has now been negotiated and confirms that 125 canadianforces members are on their way to help at long-term carecentres, presumably, to do someof the additional work thatdoctors and the nurses and aideworkers can't do. and they could be there as earlyas this afternoon.
So that is significant.
But there's just an astoundingamount of money flowing fromfederal coffers right now andi'll say this, that we gotupdated numbers on the CERB,$7 billion so far $25 billionfederal loan programme, the$71 billion wage subsidy.
and now today on top of this, Vassy, what parts stood out toyou there as highly significant.
Oil and gas is probably what youwant to talk about.



**Reporter**:
I will, if you don't mind, Rosie zero in on oil and gas.
Because as we had discussed prior to this, there's heightened need for help in thissector, especially for workers who have been laid off with the double whammy of COVID-19 and its consequences and then also Price war that emerged between Saudi Arabia and Russia The announcement from the Prime Minister today somewhat anticipated and geared towards cleaning up what are known as orphan wells in both Alberta andsaskatchewan.
I think that British Columbia as well.$1.7 billion directed towardsthat, that the government saysthat will help to maintain 5, 200 jobs.
and they have an emissionreduction fund and combiningthat and that will gospecifically towardsnewfoundland and labrador, butcombining that with the wellsannouncement, that saves ormaintains is the word that theyused about 10, 000 jobs.
On the orphan wells just toexplain -- basically this is a big problem in Alberta.
and it has actually been fordecades.
Usually an oil company willcome, drill on someone's land.
In Alberta you have rights toyour land but not to theminerals and the resourcesunderneath them.
If that company goes broke, whatended up happening is that manyof the wells then sit thereunclaimed.
They're not remediated andcleaned up and thousands of suchwells exist in Alberta rightnow.
The provincial government hasput some money towards it. The industry has put a littlebit of money towards it. But this by far is the biggestchunk of change that has beendirected towards that.
I would highlight one finalthing and that is on the secondpart of what was being asked forby the province of albertaspecifically -- more liquidityfor oil producers.
The Prime Minister said thatthey're going to be working withthe bbc, the development banksand the EDC, to offer morecredit to small and medium-sizedoil companies.
But he did not offer any specifics about how much money they would be using and if it would be, in fact, to backstop those loans.
I think that the hint they could take from that is not for big oil companies.
So that addresses some of the criticism that the government is bound to receive that they are in a way subsidizing industry.
Obviously, with environmental concerns that is sort of vulnerability for them.
I think that is aimed at addressing that possiblecriticism.
I just don't know what that backstop means, what that liquidity looks like and there were no details offered today.



**Rosemary**:
I would say that both of those measures sound interesting and we'll have to go to the press conference -- both of the measures, while they were helping the gas and oilindustry, they also have environmental components to try to move the government's agenda forward on those components.
Salimah, I'll have you talk to that if this press conference wraps up because it might never.
Thank you both.
and let's go now to the press conference with the ministers.
This is the deputy Prime Minister.

To measure our progress we must take into account the evolution of COVID-19 in Canada.
The nature and the intensity of spread depends on where you are in the country.
Although our four largest provinces continue to report the bulk of cases in Canada, the highest case numbers have been coming out of quÉbec and ontariorecently.
That is an important juncture in the intense public health efforts that are needed to stamp out the existing outbreaks, prevent new outbreaks, and trace and manage chains of transmission in the community.
To get this done without slipping backwards, allcanadians need to continue to stay home and to practise physical distancing.[end of translation]the COVID-19 outbreak in canadato be aware of as we measure ourprogress is a differentcharacter and intensity ofspread, depending where you arein the country.

So remember this is not asprint, it is a marathon and itwill only be unpleasantsurprises if we quit early.
Thank you.



Okay, thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
and now we'll hear from our minister of finance billmorneau.
Bill, please.



The hon.
Bill morneau:well, thank you very much, Chrystia.
It's good to be here, evenremotely today.
I think that as you know and ascanadians know that we've beenvery focused on supportingpeople through the course of all of the initiatives that we havetaken on an economic front.
and today is particularlyimportant in that regard.
You've seen us put forward waysto support people at the canadaemergency response benefit andthe Canada emergency wagesubsidy.
We know that some orginisationshave not been able to fully getaccess to those programmes, including the business accountfor small businesses.
So today we're announcing asignificant funding to helpthose small businesses in therural communities in particularthat might not get access to thecanada emergency businessaccount or may not be eligiblefor the Canada emergency wagesubsidy.
We also know that among theplaces hardest hit in ourcountry are the cultural sector, the arts and the culture and thesports sector.[speaking french]



**Rosemary**:
That is our daily briefing here on CBC If you want to continue watching go to CBC Ca or continue watching us on CBC news network.
We will be back here most likelytomorrow.
I'm rosemary Barton Thank you for watching.(♪♪♪)



**Rosemary**:
I'm rosemarybarton and you're watching CBC News network or CBC Ca streaming around the world.
Let's go back to finance minister bill morneau.



**The Hon.
Bill Morneau**:
That would go through heritage canadathat My colleague will be talking about.
and we know that there are manystart-up companies, companiesthat are just getting going, that might not be able to haveaccess to the Canada emergencywage subsidy or the emergencybusiness account so we'reputting money in that regard as well towards those firms.
I know that My colleague navdeepbains will be talking aboutthat.
We also recognize that there's areal importance to supportingjobs in parts of our countrythat have been particularly hardhit.
In Alberta and Saskatchewan andin Newfoundland and Labrador.
So I'm very pleased to talkabout some initiatives todaythat will support people inthose regions, in particular inthe energy sector.
We have importantly a programmewhere we're going to providesupport for Alberta and insaskatchewan and in britishcolumbia for the remediation oforphaned wells, orphan oilwells.
and abandoned oil wells.
So we'll be putting this fundingforth to the oil wellsassociation in Alberta andtogether with the government inalberta and Saskatchewan andbritish columbia, supportingabandoned wells, so that we cancreate employment and also dealwith an environmental problem.
We're also moving forward onproviding $750 million in loansto companies -- Alberta andsaskatchewan and newfoundlandand labrador -- to reduce theirmethane emissions.
So it's going to create jobs.
At the same time it allows us toreduce our environmentalsituation.
So we're trying to make surethat we're putting moneysomewhere that it will have thebiggest impact both today andover the long term.
Finally, what we know is soimportant to -- especially tofirms in the energy sector -- isthey need access to credit.
So we're very pleased today totalk about credit on acommercial basis for mid-sizedfirms in the energy sector tohelp them to bridge through areally difficult time and to be able to support their business, but also to support theiremployees.
So from that perspective, whatwe're announcing today is verymuch important for jobs, supporting people across thecountry, that might not getaccess to the programmes that wehave announced.
and helping people in particularin the energy sector to havesupport so they can have jobs orcreate jobs that will be veryhelpful to places that areparticularly hard hit.
and so with that, Chrystia, I'llsay thank you, and I lookforward if there's any questionslater.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:okay, thank you very much, bill.
Now we'll hear from our ministerof natural resources, seamuso'regan, seamus, please.
We can't hear seamus.
Seamus, we can't hear you.
Have you turned on --



It's on.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:perfect, we can hear you now.



Every time, every time.
Thank you.
So every day over the past few weeks I have been listening to workers and business owners and the industry leaders in the energy sector and living here innewfoundland and Labrador I know firsthand how hard Canada'spetroleum industry has been hit.
Canada is the fourth largest producer of oil in the world.
It is an industry that employs over 576, 000 Canadians from right across the country, including 11, 000 indigenousworkers.
It is an industry made up of more than 4, 500 businesses, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized.
It's an industry facing not onebut two crises -- the impants ofcovid-19 and the subsequent dropof global demand of 30% to 35%and the impacts of a price warbetween russia and saudi arabiathat flooded the market withunderpriced product.
Many of the measures that wehave already announced arehelping energy companies andtheir workers, including thecanada emergency businessaccount, and the canadaemergency wage subsidy.
Internationally we're workingwith the g20, the internationalenergy agency, and our United Statespartners, to bring pricestability to the oil market.
Today as bill pointed out we'redoing more.
Our goal here is twofold.
First, it addresses theshort-term liquidity needs ofthese companies.
This is both industry andlabour, and they have told me istheir most immediate priority.
Firms will be able to stayafloat for workers to have jobsto come back to. Secondly, to support the energysector's transition to net-zerowe're providing funding in twoareas -- cleaning up orphanedand inactive wells and reducinggreenhouse gas emissions.
Orphan and inactive well cleanupoffers an opportunity to put ourhighly-skilled people to workright away.
In addition, natural resourcescanada will provide $750 millionto help companies invest intechnologies that will help themto reduce their methaneemissions.
and $75 million of this fundingis particularly earmarked forcapital investment and researchgeared towards emissionreductions in the offshoreenergy sector to make thenewfoundland and labradorindustry even more competitiveinternationally.
and we will continue to workover the weeks ahead in otherways that we can maintain ourworkforce and make them morecompetitive internationally.
Thank you, Merci.
Back to you, Chrystia.

We'll now go to Minister joly.
Minister joly?



**(Voice of Translator)**:
In recent weeks I had an opportunity to have discussions with a number of heads of chambers of commerce across thecountry, to montrÉal, quÉbec, moncton and Edmonton What they've all said is that this crisis is hitting themhard.
They've shared their concerns with me, their realities, theiranxiety, and we have heard themessage.
Our objective today in conjunction with the Minister offinance, is to protect ourstreets, our small communities.
We are doubling the budget of our economic development agencies across the country, so essentially $1 billion in additional funding will go to these development agencies across the country.
Be it in the east, the middle ofcanada, the west or the north.
What we've heard is that access to financial institutions is oftentimes more difficult, so our objective is this -- we want to prevent entrepreneurs from falling through the cracks when they have critical roles to play in their communities.
Through our development and community futures orginisations, which do excellent work on theground, we will be in a position to help companies to have access to various government measures to help them to make it through the crisis.
The development agencies incanada work locally and bring the government into the communities and defend the economic reality there.
It's also responsible for helping during crises.
As it has in the past in fortmcmurray, for example, during the fires.[end of translation]we have discussions withbusiness owners via differentchambers of commerce from surreyto charlottetown and, of course, saskatoon and st. John's. and we know the crisis ishitting hard.
We heard many of the businessowners' anxieties andpreoccupations and we are --we've heard -- our mainobjective today is to make surethat we protect our main streetsall across the country.
This is why we're answering thecall by nearly doubling thebudget of our different regionaldevelopment agencies across thiscountry, from atlantic Canada toquÉbec, Ontario, the west andnorthern territories.
The idea is to provide tobusinesses, to support thebusinesses that may be fallingthrough the cracks and areplaying vital roles within theircommunities.
We're doing also another thingby making sure that we'reincreasing the budget of ourorginisations that are key toour local businesses and the aimis to make sure that we supportthem while they're doing greatwork on the ground.
So the mission of the agenciesis to make sure that the eyesand the ears of the federalgovernment are on the ground, and they're always there intimes of crisis, to deal withmaybe the fort mcmurray firesor the lac-megantic tragedy.
So what we're saying to businessowners today across this countryis that we've got your back.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:okay, thank you very much, melanie.
and now our Minister ofinnovation and science andindustry navdeep Bains, now, please.



Thank you very much, Chrystia.
In every industry and sector, companies are stepping up to lend a hand wherever possible.[speaking french](voice of translator):Minister Bains.
Companies are coming and helpingpeople as much as they can.[end of translation]canadian businesses and highlyskilled innovators that we willhelp in this period ofuncertainty.
You know, during the normalcourse of things, one of theimportant roles of government isproviding economic support tohigh potential innovative firms in the early stages ofdevelopment.
Especially in a country likecanada where science andinnovation are our strengths.
Time and time again we'veinnovated small and medium-sizedcompanies to become key economicdrivers for long-term growth ingood quality jobs for allcanadians.
We sometimes call them thefuture gazelles of Canada'seconomy.
Since they end up putting canadaleaps and bounds ahead of thecompetition.
Now government is in a uniqueposition of being able toprotect these importantcompanies and the highly skilledpeople they employ through thenational research councilsindustrial research assistanceprogramme.
Called irap.
These innovative companiescontribute disproportionatelymore to the success of thecanadian economy.
But right now many are facingreal challenges because of theeconomic downturn resulting fromcovid-19. They're looking at supply chaindisruptions, cash flow issues, acollapse in demand, and, therefore, an inability tomaintain staff to performresearch and development.
and we've heard from thestart-up community that some ofthese early stage firm does notqualify for the wage subsidy orbusiness liquidity measures thatwe announced.
We've heard the call for helpfrom the canadian businesscommunity.
and today we're answering it byinjecting $250 million into theindustrial research assistanceprogramme.
This is an investment to protectcanada's highly skilledinnovators.
This support will be targeted tocompanies identified asstrategic to the canadianeconomy, impacted by COVID-19. Whether they are pre-revenue ornot.[speaking french](voice of translator):Minister Bains.
This assistance will helpstrategic companies.[end of translation]I encourage any technology orinnovation-based business thatis unable to access the currentsupport measures to go on to thenational research council'swebsite today.
and they'll be able to sign upto be notified when theapplication opens up early nextweek.
With today's announcement weexpect to support over 1, 000canadian innovative firms andmaintain 10, 000 canadian jobsover the next three months.
Funding will begin to bedelivered within a matter ofdays.
When we support early stagefirms, we're not only protectingthe next generation of canadianentrepreneurs, but also thepeople they employ.
and we make sure that Canada'sbest technology and researchstays in Canada.
Thank you.
Merci.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:thank you very much, nav.
and we're now ready to take yourquestions.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
So we'll start with three questions on the phone and turn to the one, and one question an done follow-up.[speaking french]

---

**Question**:
Thank you.
Merci.
Our first question... fromradio-Canada.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:
(voice oftranslator): journalist.
Mr. Guilbeault, can you give us more details on the assistance that you'll provide to the cultural and the sportsindustries, who will the money go to?how will it assist?go to the sports associations?to the athletes morespecifically?



(voice of translator):answer.
Thank you, madam.
The funding goes to theorginisations.
Our sector is different in thatit is based -- or made up of, rather, of people who areindependent workers.
So they're not employees.
For whom the wage subsidy wouldhave applied.
So we're talking aboutnot-for-profit orginisations, sports orginisations at thenational level, sports centres, media orginisations, editors, companies, tv companies, musicgroups.
and the programmes that we havealready announced weren'ttailored for them and didn'ttake into account the specificnature of the arts and cultureand sporting sector.



[speaking french]

---

**Question**:
(voice oftranslator): follow-upquestion.
Minister joly, can you tell us alittle bit more about theannouncement that you've made.
You have talked aboutmunicipalities in various townsand villages across the country.
There are companies there, arethose companies not eligible forthe programmes that you'veannounced?and pwhat type of assistancewill you be offering.



(voice of translator):answer.
What we have offered throughgovernment measures recently area safety net.
and what we're doing now isensuring that no one is fallingthrough the cracks.
So we're tightening it up. We know, for example, that the$40, 000 loan and the wagesubsidy have impacts for manycompanies.
There are some that still don'thave access to that funding.
So the regional developmentagencies will be providingassistance.
The development agency inquÉbec, for example, it's calleddeck, and these agencies provideassistance in smallercommunities in quÉbec, forexample, and across the country.
So they're on the ground andthey will be helping to provideassistance to small localbusinesses in those areas.



(voice of translator):thank you, Minister.



Our next question [speakingfrench]teresa wright with canadianpress.
Please go ahead.[speaking french]

---

**Question**:
Good morning.
Dr. Tam, I'm wondering if you could tell us if there's any guidance for health workers and doctors on how ventilators should be rationed, if it comes to that.
and if anyone is working on any such guidelines?



Yes, so this allocation of the supplies has a different framework and that's in collaboration with the province sand the territories in terms of the supplies of ventilators that we have.
Now on the ground, physician sand other health workers have to make some very difficult decisions sometimes if there was not enough ventilators or I. C.u. Beds.
So those guidances have been putin place at the provincial andthe territorial level.
and, certainly, that flows downto the hospital level.
So that you have these andthey're drafted by a broad rangeof experts, including ethicistsand clinical and I. C.u. Andother experts and health systemexperts, so that those difficultdecisions can be facilitated atthe time that they're needed.



Follow-up?

---

**Question**:
Yes, and myfollow-up question is forminister morneau.
mane people on social assistanceprogrammes are surviving on lessthan people getting the CERB.
and many marginalized canadiansjust can't access it. So rather than continue to tweakit as you have been doing, whynot just make the cerbuniversal?



The hon.
Bill morneau:well, thank you for thequestion.
I think that it's important toacknowledge that there arecertainly people who areexperiencing real challenges.
We understand that.
What we've been trying to dothrough the course of thiscrisis period is to address thepeople who have lost theirincome, who have lost theirability to continue to lead thelife they were leading beforethe crisis as a result ofcovid-19. So that's how we've directed ourattention.
The good news is that it'simpacting the measures that wehave put forward are reallyhaving a big impact.
As you know we have seenliterally millions, more thanfive million people, come on thecanada emergency responsebenefit.
We as of yesterday had more than220, 000 small firms that appliedfor the Canada emergencybusiness account.
So the measures that we'retaking are having very, verywide application.
As you see today we're trying tomake sure that for placeswhere -- in particular forbusinesses that employ peoplewhere they need additionalsupport, we're coming forward tomake sure that we provide thatsupport.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question, [speakingfrench]please go ahead.

---

**Question**:
(voice oftranslator): journalist.
I'm not sure who to put my question to, but anyone can answer it. It deals with soldiers being sent in to help out in quÉbec.
In the "maclean's" article, Doctor who served in the force stalked about some 2, 500 soldiers who are trained that could be available but there's a problem with respect to their qualifications in quÉbec and inontario.
is there some way to make an exception so that more than --these particular soldiers can be used to provide assistance?



**The Hon.
ChyrstiaFREELAND**:
(voice oftranslator): Minister Freeland, answer.
The decision to respond toquÉbec's request that went to the Prime Minister is an important one.
It's a decision that was made in close cooperation with quÉbec, the Canadian forces, the minister of public safety, the minister of health, the minister of defence.
We worked hard to identify the necessary people with the language skills, the trainingrequired, to help in quÉbec.
We identified 125 people and decision was made in conjunction with quÉbec.
and these people will make adifference.
With respect to providing additional assistance, we continue to hold ongoing discussions with quÉbec.
We are working with quÉbec to support the province.
I'd also like to add that the prime Minister has stated that we will be working with the red cross and we'll also help inquÉbec.
and then there are the volunteers who have registered, so we'll also be working with that list of people to identify those who can help.
Thank you.



(voice of translator):follow-up question.
What about the volunteers?can you give us an idea of howmany more people could be sentto quÉbec from the red crossthen?and from that list of volunteers.



**The Hon.
ChyrstiaFREELAND**:
(voice oftranslator): answer, ministerfreeland.
At this point, no. What I do want to underscore is that it is essential to work in close cooperation with theprovince.
We are doing this work together and I'd also like to assurequÉbecers that we fully understand the urgency of thesituation.
and we are working very hard to find the resources to helpquÉbecers.



Thank you, Minister.
Starting with David thurton, CBC

**Question**:
The woes in the oil and gas sector isn't going away anytime soon, so some people are probably wondering if there'sgoing to be anymore help on theway?and can you maybe walk usthrough the range of things thatyou're thinking of, ministermorneau, Minister regan?



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:I'm going to -- just becausewith all of the people on thescreens it requires a bit oftraffic activity.
So I'm going to turn to seamusfirst, is that okay, david?

---

**Question**:
That's fine.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:okay, seamus, please.
You need to turn your mike backon.



a lot of what bill has already put in place has a very positive effect with the cerband with the wage subsidyparticularly.
I mean, what we're announcing today are very particularinitiatives.
Firstly, what I've heard fro mall sides, whether it be --whether it be labour or whether it be industry, everybody is talked about liquidity.
I remember My first meeting after the lock down with the petroleum producers and saying that their top five priorities were liquidity, liquidity, liquidity, liquidity.
We heard the same from workers.
So this is, you know, really important for small tomedium-sized businesses.
I think that there's aperception that the industry isdominated by massive capitalprojects, big oil rigs, miles ofpipeline.
In fact, it's dominated by smallto medium-sized businesses andthat's roughly about 85% of theworkforce is. and so concentrating on themright now is a very good thing.
I'll send the rest over to bill.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:okay, bill.



The hon.
Bill morneau:really I think that seamus gavea good indication.
and writ large across thecountry what we're seeing isthat there are businesses acrossthe country that need access tocredit during a challengingtime.
What we're announcing today isthat the energy sector isparticularly challenged, andthat's why that is so important.
The other initiatives that wehave put in place today -- theability to remediate orphanedwells and abandoned wells, toreduce our methane emissions, these are going to get peopleworking.
It's about jobs in places wherewe don't have access to jobs.
So I think that this iscritically important for peoplein those places where they'reseeing extreme challenges.
We need to recognize that we will have other measures toprovide credit acrossmedium-sized businesses andlarger businesses.
and there's more for us to talkabout in that regard in comingdays.

---

**Question**:
Okay, thank you.
and this question is from one of my colleagues.
She's asking, we know that contact tracing is important in the fight against the spread ofcovid-19. Minister Bains, what discussions are you having at the federal level about using technology to facilitate that?and are there any conversationsabout using cellphone data?



Thank you very much, thank you very much for that question.
As we've indicated, all options are on the table.
We're going to deploy all of the tools that we need to make sure that we protect Canadians'health and well-being.
Right now we're focused oneconomic measures.
We are evaluating differentsolutions with respect toproviding more information tocanadians on better practices tofollow, social distancing, physical distancing, making surethat they take those appropriatesteps to keep themselves safe.
With respect to contact tracingwe're looking at otherjurisdictions.
We want to make sure that if weare moving forward in that areathat we also deal with issueswith respect to privacy in ameaningful way.
Still early stages and we haveengaged with a robust group ofpeople across the country thatare working on some early stagetechnology projects.
But we haven't made any finaldetermination in terms of whatwe Watt to support and to moveforward with.
But we have some credibleinnovative companies across thecountry that are stepping upthat I are thinking throughthese challenges and we areengaged with them.

---

**Question**:
Thank you, ministerbains.
Mike?

---

**Question**:
Good morning, Dr. Tam.
How would you charactericize the country and what are the differences between quÉbec and the prairies and the maritimes?



I think that the majority of the cases as I said are in the four biggest jurisdictions, perhaps not surprisingly.
and that different variations in terms of the actualepidemiology.
However, I would have to say that the long-term care homes orseniors' residences outbreaksare in quite a number of themand that's what is driving someof the unfortunate increase indeaths.
So the bigger jurisdictions, particularly right now inontario and quÉbec.
But, yeah, I think that themarch break as I said might havehad some different -- adifference in timing of some ofthe epidemic trajectories.
Some jurisdictions haveimplemented measures and haven'tactually gotten the communitytransmission.
So some of the smallerjurisdictions and theterritories, they've managed topick up all of the importedcases and prevented onwardtransmission and did contacttracing.
So they're actually quitedifferent.

---

**Question**:
and this is for --well, I'll ask and see who wants to answer.
Does this suggest that there's different approach that we could take to re-starting the country, depending what province we'redealing with?



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:thanks for the question, mike.
and let me just say that thequestion of -- the economicimpact of the lockdown wasabsolutely discussed at thefirst ministers -- on the firstministers' call with the Prime Minister last night.
and all of the premiers sharedthe very diverse experienceacross the country and spokeboth about the diverseapproaches that people aretaking to fighting thecoronavirus.
and the call is very useful thatway because people can sharebest practise.
and they spoke about thedifferent places that they arein flattening the curve andabout how that was shaping theirown views about steps -- nextsteps to take.
What I will say is that we as acountry, of course, we need tounderstand that we are a huge, huge country.
and, therefore, understandablyvery, very diverse.
As Dr. Tam has just said.
One thing that we have in commonthough is that every singlecanadian has made a hugesacrifice already in fightingthe coronavirus.
That sacrifice is starting topay off.
As we heard from Dr. Tam earlierthis week, overall in the wholecountry that it is now possibleto be I think as Dr. Tam put it, ever so slightly cautiouslyoptimistic that we are achievingsome kind of flattening.
What is so essential for us allis not to squander thatachievement.
We have all paid too high aprice already to throw it away.
and so what I can say on behalfof the federal government isthat we believe really stronglythat we need to be really, really careful, reallydeliberate, and reallythoughtful about next steps.
Above all, let's remember thatwe've paid a really high pricealready and let's be sure thatthe sacrifices that we have madeare not wasted.

**Question**:
Good afternoon, this question is directed to deputy Prime Minister freelandand Dr. Tam.
With concerns about the lack of transparency from china in the start of this outbreak, the death toll in Wuhan has increased by 50% in a recent revision from the chineseauthorities.
How has the inaccuracy of the data and the suppression of the information about the outbreak in china affected Canada'sresponse to this crisis?



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:I'll let Dr. Tam start and I'mhappy to offer a response as well.



Yeah, I think that I've just been made aware of the numbers.
and I think, you know, I'mreally keen to learn further about what that means.
It's such a rapidly evolvingsituation, but I think that Otis important globally to understand the full spectrum of the illness.
So I think that getting further clarification is important.
Of course, you know, we actually have to have an understanding from every country as much as possible so that it actually helps us with some of our actions going forward.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:and I would just add to that, that first and foremost the verydifficult decisions that we havehad to take as a country inresponse to this global pandemicare based first and foremost oncanadian data.
and on the canadian reality.
and those are decisions taken bycanadian political leadersinformed by the best expertadvice that we can get.
Our primary job is fighting ithere at home.
and we make our battle plansbased on what is happening onthe ground here in Canada.
Of course the actions that wetake in Canada are informed bywhat we are seeing around theworld, and we consult, includingat a political level, widelywith colleagues and partnersaround the world.
Our Minister of healthparticipates in a g7 healthministers' call which is weekly.
I have spoken to the deputyprime Minister of singapore, whohappens to be a friend.
and I think that the singaporeanexperience is very valuable forus.
and then just a final thing thati would add is that because thispandemic poses such a threat toour country, it is absolutelyappropriate for our response to be informed by the bestintelligence that we can get, and our response is informed bycanada's excellent intelligenceexperts who are a very importantpart of the work that thegovernment is doing and havebeen briefing the government andthe ministers.
They, of course, work first andforemost with our closestsecurity partners.
The five eyes and nato and noradand the advice is informed by the information shared andcollected together by thatcommunity.

**Question**:
As a follow-up. Just how is it best to moveforward with all of these thingsbeing, what you said off thecourse, the data that you'relooking at from other countries, including china, thatrelationship that you had withother countries when you'retrying to combat a globalpandemic.
Are there any concerns that thechinese cooperation and the lackof access of the informationcoming out of china, you know, could have in any ways affectcanadian researchers that arecooperating with the lab inwuhan, for example?is there any concern about thatin terms of combating the spreadof this pandemic?and devising ways to stop it.



Well, I think that global collaboration on scientific discovery and research is really important and it can be in any area like diagnostics andtreatment.
So I think that as much global collaboration as possible isimportant.
In terms of our research, I know that our colleagues at thecanadian institute of health research had looked at the way that our government project is funded is based on peer review, and that process is independent.
So I think we have to rely on the scientific processes itself as to whether the projects are worthy of funding.
and I think -- and manyprojects, actually, involve manycountries.
So there's quite a number of projects funded in Canada that involves not just china, butmulti-country approaches.
So I think that we're going to get the solutions fast.
You still have a construct.
But the bottom line is that theyare peer reviewedscientifically, validated beforefunding is provided.



Thank you, doctor.
We'll now turn back to thephone.
Operator.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question [speakingfrench]please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

**Question**:
(voice oftranslator): Marie kastelle.
I have a question for ministerregan and morneau.[end of translation]mr. Regan, I'm worried whatfurther help could come for theoil industry?and many were asking and maybeeven expecting that thegovernment do more -- forexample, by taking equity sharesinto oil companies as thegovernment did in 2008 withautomobile companies.
I'm wondering if the governmentis considering that?and, if not, why not?and Minister morneau, I don'tknow if this was related tothat, but you sort of alluded to the credit for medium-sizedbusinesses.
I wonder if you could elaborateon what you were suggesting?



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:seamus, if you want to start andremember to unmute yourself.



It's open and I have learned my lesson twice over.
Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
The focus today was on workers.
I think that if you look at our initiatives in any sector or anybenefit, that we have -- we have changed over time.
I mean, bill has been making, you know, tweaks and changes to almost everything that we haveintroduced.
So nothing quite looks the same, because we're listening tocanadians and we're listening to stakeholders and making changes where it's needed.
Today was focused on workers in two fashions.
First of all, liquidity, to make sure that the companies that hire those workers remain intact so they can keep those workers.
and, secondly, with orphaned and inactive wells, this is, youknow, technical work, highly-skilled work.
We think that --



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:I don't think that you havemuted yourself, but thetechnology is muting you, seamus.
Let's pause for a moment.
Okay, I'm sorry, seamus, we can't hear you here.
Maybe try again.
You said highly-skilled workers, that was the last phrase that weheard.



In speaking about orphan and inactive wells, yes.
These are highly-skilledworkers, you know, that we thinkthat can employ upwards of 5, 000people and getting them workingright away because they'realready deemed to be essentialworkers.
It has the added benefit, obviously, and an environmentalbenefit in cleaning up thesewells.
So it's in keeping with ourenvironmental priorities and ourcommitment to net zero.



The hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:okay, thank you.
and maybe now, bill, would youlike to answer the part of thequestion directed at you andcould you -- there we go. We see you now.



**The Hon.
Bill Morneau**:
The key -- the key thing that we'veheard from businesses across the country really is that they need access to credit.
We've got a particular challenge where businesses are either not operating or operating with significantly less revenue for a period of time.
and they need credit to get through that time.
So that's why we've come forward with today and it is so appropriate for businesses.
Businesses don't want government taking equity in their business.
They want to find a way they can continue in their business operations so they can continue to have the opportunities, both for their people and for theirorginisation that they'reseeking.
We have been working together asseamus said with organisations in the sector.
Also speaking to people within the various provincialgovernments.
We think this is targetedappropriately.
It's credit, it's on commercial basis and it would allow businesses -- and businesses importantly in the energy sector -- that are important to jobs innewfoundland and Labrador to bridge this time to get to what we know is a better time once we get through this crisis.



[speaking french]

**Question**:
It sort of sounds like you weren't quite in agreement in your questions.
So I guess that I'll ask itagain.
In terms of the possibility of the government buying equity shares in oil companies, it sort of sounds, Minister o'regan, like you were saying maybe?am I correct in understandingwhat you were saying?



No, what I am saying is that we continue to listen to stakeholders and to listen to their suggestions and listen directly to them.
Myself and My colleagues spend most of our day doing that.
We have listened very carefully.
and some things we're able to dotoday.
In the case, for instance, withnewfoundland and Labrador there's further initiatives thatwe're looking at to keep the industry competitive.
We'll be working with them onthat.
I'd like to take the opportunity to speak to how constructive our relationship has been with theprovinces.
I enjoy very good relationships with energy ministers and natural resource ministers right across the country, andcanadians should know how constructive they've been, particularly the three energy ministers from the three oil andgas-producing provinces innewfoundland and labrador andsaskatchewan and, of course, Alberta.
They have been very, veryconstructive.
and a lot of what we've beenable to do we've been able to dotogether.[please stand by]at this point?



Heather started with bill, so why don't we start with bill, too.
Bill, please.



Well, thanks, heather.
So, first of all, the broad picture, we recognize there are businesses across the country that need access to credit.
So that is creditically important.
The emergency business account is for the smallest of businesses.
The credit we already put out over the course of the last three weeks through the business development bank and export development Canada is up to $12.5 million of credit for small to mid-sized businesses.
What we're talking about today is for credit for those mid-sized businesses and we start with the energy sector where we know the challenges are very significant.
It's COVID-19, it is the challenge in the changing oil prices and decrease in demand.
These things together means that credit is very much needed for those businesses.
That is why we started there.
There will be more that we need to do for credit across mid-sized businesses across the country and that will be coming shortly.



Seamus?



Just to reinforce the point that the vast majority of workers in the oil and gas sector and small and medium-sized businesses whether it's contractors or drillers or producer and small operators across the country.
So, focus on them is a focus on workers and ensuring that these companies remain in tact so that these workers have jobs to come back to once we get through this.



**Reporter**:
Ok. As a follow-up, did you put a number on the --



**Rosemary**:
Ok. We'll pull away from the federal briefing today and leave you with the notion that the Prime Minister announced earlier, $1.7 billion to help clean up orphan wells in Alberta.
More possible credit to come for oil and gas companies that have been hit by a double want my of COVID-19 and significant drop in oil prices.
I'll leave it there for you today.
Let us bring you now to Toronto where the premier of Ontario, Doug ford, is speaking.
