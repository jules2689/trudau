**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking  on a daily update in the government's fight  Another huge amount of money to help different Canadians in different sectors in this country.
and I'll bring in Vassy    to muddle through what we heard there, because there's a lot of it, andwe're waiting for a federal briefing as well.
Let me just say this part thatquÉbec did ask for additional help from the federal government and that has now been negotiated and confirms that 125  members are on their way to help at long-term carecentres,  to do someof  additional work thatdoctors and the nurses and aideworkers  do. and they could be there as earlyas  afternoon.
So that is significant.
But there's just an astoundingamount  money flowing fromfederal  right now andi'll say this, that we gotupdated  on the CERB,$7  so far $25 billionfederal  programme,  billion wage subsidy.
and now today on top of this, Vassy,  parts stood out toyou  as highly significant.
Oil and gas is probably what youwant  talk about.



**Reporter**:
I will, if you don't mind, rosier zero in on oil and gas.
Because as we had discussed prior to this, there's heightened need for help in  especially for workers who have been laid off with the double whammy of COVID-19 and its consequences and then also price war that emerged between Saudi Arabia and  The announcement from the Prime Minister today somewhat anticipated and geared towards cleaning up what are known as orphan wells in both Alberta  I think that BC as well.$1.7 billion  towardsthat, that the  saysthat will help to maintain 5, 200 jobs.
and they have  emissionreduction fund and combiningthat and that  gospecifically towardsnewfoundland and  butcombining that with  wellsannouncement, that  ormaintains is the word  theyused about 10, 000 jobs.
On the orphan wells  toexplain -- basically this is a big problem in Alberta.
and it has actually  fordecades.
Usually an oil  willcome, drill on someone's land.
In Alberta you have  toyour land but not  theminerals and  resourcesunderneath them.
If that company goes  whatended up happening is  manyof the wells then  thereunclaimed.
They're   andcleaned up and thousands  suchwells exist in Alberta rightnow.
The provincial  hasput some money towards it. The industry has put a littlebit of money towards it. But this by far is  biggestchunk of change that  beendirected towards that.
I would highlight  finalthing and that is on  secondpart of what was being  forby the province of albertaspecifically --  liquidityfor oil producers.
The Prime Minister said thatthey're going to be   bbc, the  banksand  EDC., to  morecredit to small and  companies.
But he did not offer any specifics about how much money they would be using and if it would be, in fact, to backstop those loans.
I think that the hint they could take from that is not for big oil companies.
So that addresses some of the criticism that the government is bound to receive that they are in a way subsidizing industry.
Obviously, with environmental concerns that is sort of vulnerability for them.
I think that is aimed at addressing that  I just don't know what that backstop means, what that liquidity looks like and there were no details offered today.



**Rosemary**:
I would say that both of those measures sound interesting and we'll have to go to the press conference -- both of the measures, while they were helping the gas and  they also have environmental components to try to move the government's agenda forward on those components.
 I'll have you talk to that if this press conference wraps up because it might never.
Thank you both.
and let's go now to the press conference with the ministers.
This is the deputy Prime Minister.

A LOT OF WHAT BILL HASALREADY PUT IN PLACE HAS A VERYPOSITIVE EFFECT WITH THE CERBAND WITH THE WAGE SUBSIDYPARTICULARLY.I MEAN, WHAT WE'RE ANNOUNCINGTODAY ARE VERY PARTICULARINITIATIVES.FIRSTLY, WHAT I'VE HEARD FROMALL SIDES, WHETHER IT BE --WHETHER IT BE LABOUR OR WHETHERIT BE INDUSTRY, EVERYBODY ISTALKED ABOUT LIQUIDITY.I REMEMBER MY FIRST MEETINGAFTER THE LOCKDOWN WITH THEPETROLEUM PRODUCERS AND SAYINGTHAT THEIR TOP FIVE PRIORITIESWERE LIQUIDITY, LIQUIDITY,LIQUIDITY, LIQUIDITY.WE HEARD THE SAME FROM WORKERS.SO THIS IS, YOU KNOW, REALLYIMPORTANT FOR SMALL TOMEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES.I THINK THAT THERE'S APERCEPTION THAT THE INDUSTRY ISDOMINATED BY MASSIVE CAPITALPROJECTS, BIG OIL RIGS, MILES OFPIPELINE.IN FACT, IT'S DOMINATED BY SMALLTO MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES ANDTHAT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT 85% OF THEWORKFORCE IS.AND SO CONCENTRATING ON THEMRIGHT NOW IS A VERY GOOD THING.I'LL SEND THE REST OVER TO BILL.

Good morning, Dr. Tam.
How would you  the country and what are the differences between quÉbec and the prairies and the 



I THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OFTHE CASES AS I SAID ARE IN THEFOUR BIGGEST JURISDICTIONS,PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY.AND THAT DIFFERENT VARIATIONS INTERMS OF THE ACTUALEPIDEMIOLOGY.HOWEVER, I WOULD HAVE TO SAYTHAT THE LONG-TERM CARE HOMES ORSENIORS' RESIDENCES OUTBREAKSARE IN QUITE A NUMBER OF THEMAND THAT'S WHAT IS DRIVING SOMEOF THE UNFORTUNATE INCREASE INDEATHS.SO THE BIGGER JURISDICTIONS,PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW INONTARIO AND QUÉBEC.BUT, YEAH, I THINK THAT THEMARCH BREAK AS I SAID MIGHT HAVEHAD SOME DIFFERENT -- ADIFFERENCE IN TIMING OF SOME OFTHE EPIDEMIC TRAJECTORIES.SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVEIMPLEMENTED MEASURES AND HAVEN'TACTUALLY GOTTEN THE COMMUNITYTRANSMISSION.SO SOME OF THE SMALLERJURISDICTIONS AND THETERRITORIES, THEY'VE MANAGED TOPICK UP ALL OF THE IMPORTEDCASES AND PREVENTED ONWARDTRANSMISSION AND DID CONTACTTRACING.SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITEDIFFERENT.

The Hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT,THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST THE VERYDIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WE HAVEHAD TO TAKE AS A COUNTRY INRESPONSE TO THIS GLOBAL PANDEMICARE BASED FIRST AND FOREMOST ONCANADIAN DATA.AND ON THE CANADIAN REALITY.AND THOSE ARE DECISIONS TAKEN BYCANADIAN POLITICAL LEADERSINFORMED BY THE BEST EXPERTADVICE THAT WE CAN GET.OUR PRIMARY JOB IS FIGHTING ITHERE AT HOME.AND WE MAKE OUR BATTLE PLANSBASED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING ONTHE GROUND HERE IN CANADA.OF COURSE THE ACTIONS THAT WETAKE IN CANADA ARE INFORMED BYWHAT WE ARE SEEING AROUND THEWORLD, AND WE CONSULT, INCLUDINGAT A POLITICAL LEVEL, WIDELYWITH COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERSAROUND THE WORLD.OUR MINISTER OF HEALTHPARTICIPATES IN A G7 HEALTHMINISTERS' CALL WHICH IS WEEKLY.I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE DEPUTYPRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE, WHOHAPPENS TO BE A FRIEND.AND I THINK THAT THE SINGAPOREANEXPERIENCE IS VERY VALUABLE FORUS.AND THEN JUST A FINAL THING THATI WOULD ADD IS THAT BECAUSE THISPANDEMIC POSES SUCH A THREAT TOOUR COUNTRY, IT IS ABSOLUTELYAPPROPRIATE FOR OUR RESPONSE TOBE INFORMED BY THE BESTINTELLIGENCE THAT WE CAN GET,AND OUR RESPONSE IS INFORMED BYCANADA'S EXCELLENT INTELLIGENCEEXPERTS WHO ARE A VERY IMPORTANTPART OF THE WORK THAT THEGOVERNMENT IS DOING AND HAVEBEEN BRIEFING THE GOVERNMENT ANDTHE MINISTERS.THEY, OF COURSE, WORK FIRST ANDFOREMOST WITH OUR CLOSESTSECURITY PARTNERS.THE FIVE EYES AND NATO AND NORADAND THE ADVICE IS INFORMED BYTHE INFORMATION SHARED ANDCOLLECTED TOGETHER BY THATCOMMUNITY.

**Question**:
As a follow-up. Just how is it best to moveforward  all of these thingsbeing,  you said off thecourse,  data that you'relooking at from other countries, including china, thatrelationship  you had withother  when you'retrying to combat a globalpandemic.
 there any concerns that thechinese  and the lackof  of the informationcoming  of china, you know, could have in any ways affectcanadian  that arecooperating  the lab inwuhan,  example?is there any concern about thatin terms  combating the spreadof this  devising ways to stop it.



WELL, I THINK THAT GLOBALCOLLABORATION ON SCIENTIFICDISCOVERY AND RESEARCH IS REALLYIMPORTANT AND IT CAN BE IN ANYAREA LIKE DIAGNOSTICS ANDTREATMENT.SO I THINK THAT AS MUCH GLOBALCOLLABORATION AS POSSIBLE ISIMPORTANT.IN TERMS OF OUR RESEARCH, I KNOWTHAT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THECANADIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTHRESEARCH HAD LOOKED AT THE WAYTHAT OUR GOVERNMENT PROJECT ISFUNDED IS BASED ON PEER REVIEW,AND THAT PROCESS IS INDEPENDENT.SO I THINK WE HAVE TO RELY ONTHE SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES ITSELFAS TO WHETHER THE PROJECTS AREWORTHY OF FUNDING.AND I THINK -- AND MANYPROJECTS, ACTUALLY, INVOLVE MANYCOUNTRIES.SO THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER OFPROJECTS FUNDED IN CANADA THATINVOLVES NOT JUST CHINA, BUTMULTI-COUNTRY APPROACHES.SO I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TOGET THE SOLUTIONS FAST.YOU STILL HAVE A CONSTRUCT.BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEYARE PEER REVIEWEDSCIENTIFICALLY, VALIDATED BEFOREFUNDING IS PROVIDED.

**Question**:
(voice  Marie  I have a question for  and  of translation]mr. Regan,   whatfurther help  come for theoil industry?and  were asking and maybeeven expecting that  do more --  by taking  sharesinto oil companies  thegovernment did in 2008  companies.
I'm  if the governmentis considering that?and,  not, why not?and Minister morneau, I don'tknow if this  related tothat, but you sort of alluded to the credit for medium-sizedbusinesses.
I wonder if you could  what you were suggesting?



The Hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:SEAMUS, IF YOU WANT TO START ANDREMEMBER TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.



IT'S OPEN AND I HAVE LEARNEDMY LESSON TWICE OVER.THANK YOU, DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER.THE FOCUS TODAY WAS ON WORKERS.I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OURINITIATIVES IN ANY SECTOR OR ANYBENEFIT, THAT WE HAVE -- WE HAVECHANGED OVER TIME.I MEAN, BILL HAS BEEN MAKING,YOU KNOW, TWEAKS AND CHANGES TOALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVEINTRODUCED.SO NOTHING QUITE LOOKS THE SAME,BECAUSE WE'RE LISTENING TOCANADIANS AND WE'RE LISTENING TOSTAKEHOLDERS AND MAKING CHANGESWHERE IT'S NEEDED.TODAY WAS FOCUSED ON WORKERS INTWO FASHIONS.FIRST OF ALL, LIQUIDITY, TO MAKESURE THAT THE COMPANIES THATHIRE THOSE WORKERS REMAIN INTACTSO THEY CAN KEEP THOSE WORKERS.AND, SECONDLY, WITH ORPHANED ANDINACTIVE WELLS, THIS IS, YOUKNOW, TECHNICAL WORK,HIGHLY-SKILLED WORK.WE THINK THAT --



The Hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVEMUTED YOURSELF, BUT THETECHNOLOGY IS MUTING YOU, SEAMUS.LET'S PAUSE FOR A MOMENT.OKAY, I'M SORRY, SEAMUS, WECAN'T HEAR YOU HERE.MAYBE TRY AGAIN.YOU SAID HIGHLY-SKILLED WORKERS,THAT WAS THE LAST PHRASE THAT WEHEARD.



IN SPEAKING ABOUT ORPHAN ANDINACTIVE WELLS, YES.THESE ARE HIGHLY-SKILLEDWORKERS, YOU KNOW, THAT WE THINKTHAT CAN EMPLOY UPWARDS OF 5,000PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM WORKINGRIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THEY'REALREADY DEEMED TO BE ESSENTIALWORKERS.IT HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT,OBVIOUSLY, AND AN ENVIRONMENTALBENEFIT IN CLEANING UP THESEWELLS.SO IT'S IN KEEPING WITH OURENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES AND OURCOMMITMENT TO NET ZERO.



The Hon.
Chyrstia Freeland:OKAY, THANK YOU.AND MAYBE NOW, BILL, WOULD YOULIKE TO ANSWER THE PART OF THEQUESTION DIRECTED AT YOU ANDCOULD YOU -- THERE WE GO.WE SEE YOU NOW.



**The Hon.
Bill Morneau**:
The key -- the key thing that we'veheard from businesses across the country really is that they need access to credit.
We've got a particular challenge where businesses are either not operating or operating with significantly less revenue for a period of time.
and they need credit to get through that time.
So that's why we've come forward with today and it is so appropriate for businesses.
Businesses don't want government taking equity in their business.
They want to find a way they can continue in their business operations so they can continue to have the opportunities, both for their people and for  that they'reseeking.
We have been working together  said with organisations in the sector.
Also speaking to people within the various  We think this is  It's credit, it's on commercial basis and it would allow businesses -- and businesses importantly in the energy sector -- that are important to jobs  and  to bridge this time to get to what we know is a better time once we get through this crisis.

**Question**:
It sort of sounds like you weren't quite in agreement in your questions.
So I guess that I'll ask  In terms of the possibility of the government buying equity shares in oil companies, it sort of sounds, Minister o'regan, like you were saying maybe?am I correct in understandingwhat  were saying?



NO, WHAT I AM SAYING IS THATWE CONTINUE TO LISTEN TOSTAKEHOLDERS AND TO LISTEN TOTHEIR SUGGESTIONS AND LISTENDIRECTLY TO THEM.MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES SPENDMOST OF OUR DAY DOING THAT.WE HAVE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY.AND SOME THINGS WE'RE ABLE TO DOTODAY.IN THE CASE, FOR INSTANCE, WITHNEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR,THERE'S FURTHER INITIATIVES THATWE'RE LOOKING AT TO KEEP THEINDUSTRY COMPETITIVE.WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM ONTHAT.I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITYTO SPEAK TO HOW CONSTRUCTIVE OURRELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN WITH THEPROVINCES.I ENJOY VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPSWITH ENERGY MINISTERS ANDNATURAL RESOURCE MINISTERS RIGHTACROSS THE COUNTRY, ANDCANADIANS SHOULD KNOW HOWCONSTRUCTIVE THEY'VE BEEN,PARTICULARLY THE THREE ENERGYMINISTERS FROM THE THREE OIL ANDGAS-PRODUCING PROVINCES INNEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR ANDSASKATCHEWAN AND, OF COURSE,ALBERTA.THEY HAVE BEEN VERY, VERYCONSTRUCTIVE.AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE BEENABLE TO DO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DOTOGETHER.[please stand by]AT THIS POINT?



HEATHER STARTED WITH BILL, SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH BILL, TOO.BILL, PLEASE.



WELL, THANKS, HEATHER.SO, FIRST OF ALL, THE BROAD PICTURE, WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT NEED ACCESS TO CREDIT.SO THAT IS CREDITICALLY IMPORTANT.THE EMERGENCY BUSINESS ACCOUNT IS FOR THE SMALLEST OF BUSINESSES.THE CREDIT WE ALREADY PUT OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE WEEKS THROUGH THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK AND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CANADA IS UP TO $12.5 MILLION OF CREDIT FOR SMALL TO MID-SIZED BUSINESSES.WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS FOR CREDIT FOR THOSE MID-SIZED BUSINESSES AND WE START WITH THE ENERGY SECTOR WHERE WE KNOW THE CHALLENGES ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT.IT'S COVID-19, IT IS THE CHALLENGE IN THE CHANGING OIL PRICES AND DECREASE IN DEMAND.THESE THINGS TOGETHER MEANS THAT CREDIT IS VERY MUCH NEEDED FOR THOSE BUSINESSES.THAT IS WHY WE STARTED THERE.THERE WILL BE MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO FOR CREDIT ACROSS MID-SIZED BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT WILL BE COMING SHORTLY.



SEAMUS?



JUST TO REINFORCE THE POINT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WHETHER IT'S CONTRACTORS OR DRILLERS OR PRODUCER AND SMALL OPERATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.SO, FOCUS ON THEM IS A FOCUS ON WORKERS AND ENSURING THAT THESE COMPANIES REMAIN IN TACT SO THAT THESE WORKERS HAVE JOBS TO COME BACK TO ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS.



**Reporter**:
Ok. As a follow-up, did you put a number on the --



**Rosemary**:
Ok. We'll pull away from the federal briefing today and leave you with the notion that the Prime Minister announced earlier, $1.7 billion to help clean up orphan wells in Alberta.
More possible credit to come for oil and gas companies that have been hit by a double want my of COVID-19 and significant drop in oil prices.
I'll leave it there for you today.
Let US bring you now to Toronto where the premier of Ontario, Doug ford, is speaking.
