and a happy orthodox Easter to everyone celebrating today.
Even if it's just over  I hope you can spend this special with family and friends.
Although this pandemic has affected everyone, some people have been hit especially hard.
Right now, too many Canadians are facing some really difficult situations.
If you live with a disability, I don't have to tell you what this can look like.
You might be worried about whether your support worker will be able to keep coming.
You might be concerned about getting groceries or about your finances.
and if you're caring for someone with a disability, you're probably anxious about getting support, too.
Your voice matters.
Your experience is important.
and our government is listening.
If this crisis has laid the gaps that still exist for far too many Canadians, it is also given US an opportunity to address them.
It has encouraged US to have even more meaningful conversations about how we can make our country a more inclusive and a more equitable place.
Last week, Minister  lunched a COVID-19 disability advisory group as part of our plan to. Keep all Canadians healthy, informed and safe.
We're addressing key issues like equal access to health care and information as well as support on jobs and income.
and we're doing all of this work with you at the table.
On that note, I want to recognize the outstanding organisations across the country.
Like the rick Hansen foundation that are bringing these issues to the fore.
You are doing inc*ep  work.
and we are proud to be your partner.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
Last week, Minister  launched the disability advisory group.
That is part of our plan to help everyone to stay healthy and safe.
We are facing an unprecedented situation and we are now looking at the most important issue, such as equal access to health care and information.
We also want to provide financial support to those WHO need it and we have put measures in place to protect jobs.
This is work we're doing together.
I want to thank all the leaders and organizers around the country that are drawing attention to particular challenges that the most vulnerable Canadians are facing.
Few are doing an extraordinary job and we're there to be your full partner.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
In responses to this pandemic, we've developed a three-point economic plan to help Canadians get through this tough time.
We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit to help people WHO have lost their wages.
We brought in new loans for businesses and we introduced the wage subsidy.
But there is still work to do. There are still people to reach.
That's why this past week we expanded the emergency response benefit to include workers making up to $1, 000 a month, seasonal workers and those whose e. I. has recently run out.
It's why we put in place new measures to support people in the energy industry, which is suffering right now.
and we also brought in support for people WHO continue to do incredible work in the arts, culture and sports communities.
and it's why we kept making attempts with the progress and territories on increasing wages for essential workers WHO need it. Things are tough for employers, too.
So we brought in a whole range of additional support on loans and credit and for indigenous businesses and businesses in the north.
and for communities that need extra support.
We approved requests to have the canadian  forces assist in long-term care facilities as well as in nunavik.
I  also announce that we approved an extension for Quebec to help first nations.
All these measures we brought in are about helping you do the things that will get US through this.
and it's working.
We're seeing the numbers trend in the right direction.
So we need to keep doing what we're doing and keep being extremely careful.
and we will get through this together.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
From the beginning of the crisis, we have been announcing historic measures with the emergency benefit, the wage subsidy and the loans to small businesses.
We are helping millions of families and workers and entrepreneurs.
But there are still people we need to help.
This week, we ex tented support through the benefit.
We put in place new measures for energy sector workers, a sector particularly hard hit by the epidemic.
and we also want to help people doing an extraordinary job in the arts and culture and sports communities.
At the same time, we're working with the territories to increase the wages of essential workers WHO need more support.
Of course, this is also a difficult period for employers.
Therefore, we introduced a whole series of additional measures, including loans and contributions to businesses, including for indigenous and northern businesses.
and for those communities that need a little bit more help, we have approved requests for the Canadian armed forces to be deployed to Quebec in long-term care homes and in nunavik and the lower north shore.
Today I can also announce that the rangers will be helping other communities in Quebec.
We introduced all of these different measures to allow you to follow the recommendations of our health experts and help US to fight this virus.
and it's working.
The numbers show that we're moving in the right direction.
So, we must continue to stay home and be cautious.
and together we will get through this.
Having said that, even if we're pointing out certain encouraging trends, we must not dilute ourselves.
Across this country, there are thousands of families going through terrible times.
Because of this pandemic.
I just want to take a moment to express My deep condolences to those WHO are mourning.
All Canadians share your sadness and they stand with you during these terrible ordeals.
Know that the government is there for you and they will come through these difficult times together.
We cannot see this news without thinking of the seniors in their residences that can't see their children, that can't see their grandchildren except on facetime and WHO are afraid, WHO see the news and hear about what's happening in seniors' homes across the province and across the country.
and they're worried as to whether they will ever see their children or grandchildren again.
It's extremely hard.
and we must do everything we can for them by working together, but also by making it clear that everyone has to continue to stay home.
We have to continue to slow the spread of this virus and together we will get through this.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:
and because it's Sunday, I want to end again by talking directly to all the kids WHO might be watching.
This week is national volunteer week.
That means we say thank you to everyone around US doing things like helping seniors get groceries or pouting in a shift at a food bank.
You can join in from home, too.
Ask your parents if you can help them make dinner and do extra cleaning around the house.
Help your brother or sister with school work.
Say hi over face time to your grandparents WHO I know are missing you.
Young, and young at heart, we can all make a real difference.
I heard a great story the other day.
About a restaurant in Nova Scotia, the canteen.
They turned the restaurant into a community kitchen where people pitch in and get meals to those in need.
and there have been thousands of Canadians WHO have already signed up through our national COVID-19 volunteer improvement campaign to lighten the load on our front line workers.
Everyone can help out.
Everyone can help US get through this.[speaking french].



**Interpreter**:
To all the children WHO are now at home, don't forget that we need you.
Ask your parents if you can help them prepare a meal or help with the cleaning.
Help your brother or your sister with their homework.
Say hello on face time to your grandparents WHO miss you.
We are all able to do our best and make this a better place.
and at this time, as we're facing a challenge like we've never seen before, we all have a chances to contribute.
But I know that we will all continue to do our part.
Thank you very much.
