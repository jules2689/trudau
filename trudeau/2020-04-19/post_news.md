The Prime Minister of Canada with his daily briefing, daily update on his government's approach to fighting the pandemi
I'll bring in the cbc's David  a couple of points I would make,  from listening to the Prime Ministe
There is no one, not any party that is asking for all 
Performs to return tomorro
So, that just in case people got that impressio
and there is nothing that would require all 338 MP's to come to Ottawa tomorro
They could continue to do their parliamentary work in their ridings if they chose not to com
But further to that, as they were speaking, the DP Made clear that no matter what happens tomorrow there will only be three of the MP's here tomorro
I don't want people to go away with the impression that they will suddenly, if there is no deal, be 338 MP's in the house of common
That's the image that he left with people and that is the wrong impressio


**Reporter**:
They are saying that conservatives are not taking a responsible approach wanting a minimum of three in-person sitings a wee
So they can have question period as much as they want during this pandemic, wanting to hold the government to account for the actions it's take or not takin
The greens wanting to go completely virtual and the liberals and the NDP  an agreement to do one day in-person and then two days virtua
N
There is no requirement for all 338 to come back and nobody necessarily wants tha
Absent an agreement, it is possible that an undetermined number of 
Performs could come back to parliament and insist on taking their sea
There was some unpredictability even when there was an agreement tos pa  a several weeks ag
Scott reid showed  to protest what was being don
So negotiations are continuing with public pronouncements being made by political leaders 
Conservatives essentially saying trudeau is  taking the accountable approach and if he can take questions from reporters every day and ministers can hold press conferences every day sitting next to D
Tam and D
Njoo,   they go down the hall into the house of commons and give some answers to the dully-elected members of the house of common
There is no consensus on thi
The bulk of the parties, which is the majority of the 
Performs, think that the conservatives are asking for too muc
and the conservatives saying the government giving too littl


**Rosemary**:
O
Thank you for your help with your coverag
I appreciate tha
and we'll have an update on whether they'll return in some way by the end of the da
Let's go to our breaking news in Nova Scoti
Because the Prime Minister also talked about tha

The shooter has been identified by the RCMP as 51-year-old -- excuse me -- his last name is and it has been such a -- gunman wortman --  scaped  from
 began last night in Portapique,  about 10 -- excuse me -- it's about 10 minutes up the road from where I'm standin
I'm standing in great village right no
Portapique is not too far awa
It began last night around 11:3
With some kind of violent incident causing multiple victim
We don't know yet whether those victims are dead or whether they're injure
We don't know how many of them, whether multiple victims means two or mor
We do know that probably about an hour ago, maybe a little more than that, was apprehended by the RCMP on highway 10
He was heading toward halifax  dartmout
 can tell you a little bit more about no
We know that he is a denturis
 RCMP at one point said he might have access to a replica or some car that looked like an RCMP car or RCMP uniform but they were very clear he does not work for the RCM
We know that he is a denturis

Including several properties in Portapiqu

So this is certainly an unfolding incident and we expect to get more from the RCMP this afternoo


**Rosemary**:

**Rosemary**:
I appreciate the new  you found out about the suspect, gunman and a gentleman earlier said he heard fires and propane blowing, maybe propane attached to the home
But didn't really have a sense of how things were unfoldin
I just want to reiterate that point, though, about the RCMP vehicle and potentially unifor
Because at one point the suspect did change car

**Reporter**:
We know that the RCMP used Twitter, as I've been saying, they've been using that a lo
The suspect was traveling in an RCMP -- what looked like an RCMP vehicle and what looked like an RCMP unifor
We don't know too much about how he got those items or where exactly they came from, whether they were legitimate items or no
But he was traveling in an RCMP vehicle and then shortly after that, the RCMP told us that he had switched to a silver SUV Chevy tracke
We believe that's how it played ou
