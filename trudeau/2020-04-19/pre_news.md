And cbcnews. Ca. We are standing by for the Prime Minister's daily update on the federal responses to the pandemic. But, of course, we are also at this hour tracking breaking news out of nova scotia. Rcmp say they now have a shooting suspect in custody. The suspect has been on the run for several tense hours, following what is  being described as a violent incident in a small community near truro. We don't know a lot more. But we will expect the Prime Minister might likely address the situation now that the suspect is in custody. Let's begin with that breaking news story in nova scotia. Shaina luck joins me from great village, close to where some of this morning's events unfolded. And this has been going on for hours. What can you tell us about how it's played out?

Reporter:
Well, as you said, the suspect -- we know  from rcmp that gabriel wortman is now in custody and we know that he has been on the run for approximately 12 hours. The rcmp tell us that he was tracked down between here and halifax. We last know that he was seen traveling on highway 102. That is the highway, the major highway that runs between here and the city. About 45 kilometres away from where I am. And he was last seen traveling in a small silver s. U.v. We had heard from police that he might have been wearing an rcmp uniform or what looked like an rcmp uniform. At one point, he was also traveling, they believed, in a car that looked like an rcmp car. But the rcmp put out a heavy presence on that highway and they were able to apprehend him probably we first got word of that maybe just 20 minutes ago. Now we do know that this came out of some kind of incident that happened last night around 11:30. That. Happened in the town just about 10 minutes up the road from me. It's called portapique, a small community. We know that there are multiple victims. We don't know how many and we don't know how badly they are injured. And we do expect there will be an update from the rcmp at some point this afternoon. But for now we know the suspect is in custody. Rosey?

Rosemary:
So many unusual parts to this story. He is in custody now as you say. But the fact he did seem to be impersonating or pretending to be rcmp officer, the rcmp ga*ef a lot of information about that as well.

YES, THAT'S RIGHT.WE DO KNOW FROM THE RCMP THAT HE IS NOT ACTUALLY AN RCMP OFFICER.WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW EXACTLY HE CAME TO HAVE THAT RCMP VEHICLE AND RCMP UNIFORM, WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE ARTICLES.WE DO KNOW THAT HE IS NOT AN RCMP EMPLOYEE.CBC HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT HE IS A VENTURIST.

Rosemary:
Ok. Appreciate that. The cbc's shaina luck reporting from great village, nova scotia. To remind you a little bit about how that unfolded, starting at 11:30 last night. Near portapique, there was a tweet from the rcmp telling people that there was a situation unfolding, telling them that there was an active shooter. Earlier this morning, telling them to stay in their homes and go to their basements in order to stay safe. There was a lot of communication between local rcmp on the ground via twitter and other means to make sure that residents didn't get hurt further. They now say that the suspect, gabriel wortman, is in custody and they did manage to apprehend him there somewhere along the highway near truro, nova scotia and, again, we do know that there are multiple victims. We don't know if they have been injured or killed. We expect the rcmp in nova scotia to update us the moment we hear more about that situation. So obviously important, breaking news out of nova scotia. We'll continue to track it. At this hour, we're expecting to hear from Prime Minister justin trudeaus doing his daily briefing to the nation around his government's response to covid-19. So let's bring in david cochrane. I expect that the Prime Minister will probably say something about this incident in nova scotia first. And maybe give us some details if he has any, david. What else are we expecting from him today?

Reporter:
I'm not sure we'll get much in the way of a significant news announcement today. But the news that is happening here in ottawa is the negotiations happening behind the scenes with all the partis to figure out what to do about the house of commons which is due to come back in full force with all 388 m. P.s scheduled to come back and take their seats in the middle of a pandemic, an thao*uk no one is super keen to have at all. There are talks of reduced sitings with reduced numbers, but they are not all the way down yet. The liberals and new democrats have reached an agreement in the last 20 minutes as far as I can tell, that they would get the support of liberal n. D.p. To have one sitting this week with a lot of time dedicated to question period, the equivalents of a week of question period happening in one city and then move into one virtual sitting next week and the week after that, one in person and two virtual sitings and that would become the template for the house of commons on how it would function going forward. This is a move from the liberals who wanted one sitting and one virtual sitting as the baseline each week. They decided to go up to two to satisfy the new democrats. The greens and bloc quÉbÉcois, would go along with this. Andrew scheer is keen to have parliament come back and resume its normal function in what are abnormal times with a reduced sitting. Something like we saw before and theys paed legislation of 30 to 40m. P.s from around the ottawa area. The conservatives started with a request or demand for four in-person sitings as the negotiations have gone on, they have countered with three in-person sitings. The liberals, the greens, the bloc, they don't want to go to that. You can reduce the number of m. P.s, but you need staff, broadcasters, political staff, clerks and dozens and dozens of people would go into the west block and even last time with the reduced sitings, elizabeth may and others complained that when you left your seats there's lots of seats. And when you head back, there's too many support staff for people to safely social distance. These are the behind the scenes conversations in ottawa. What is the compromise?four of the parties have largely found an agreement that functions. The conservatives are not on board with that yet and we'll hear from andrew scheer a little bit later this afternoon to see what he has to say on this.

Rosemary:
I realise for people that that is a lot of days and a lot of information about what's trying to go on here. But essentially they're trying to find a way for parliamentarians to do their work in some capacity inside the house of commons and for the government to answer questions and be held to account for decisions that it's making. It is vitally important. I don't think anyone disagrees with that.

Reporter:
Everything is suspended and put on hold. But democracy hasn't been abandoned in canada. The house normally sits five days a week with people flying in from all over the country, there's no way for that to happen safely and practically. So, the liberals wanted to have one sitting day a week with an online virtual day. They are trying to find a solution for everybody. You can understand the em pulse of the conservatives of wanting to have an opportunity to question the Prime Minister and the various ministers. We're up to almost $300 billion in aid that has been put on the table by the government. You know, a full year's budget is normally about $350 billion. So, they have done almost a year of spending in a matter of four or five weeks. As the urgent needs caused by covid-19 keep expanding and growing and more and more people are. Captured by these programmes. We've seen andrew scheer come back to ottawa with his family and holding daily press conferences. And his argument is that this is necessary to hold the government to account by answering clear and specific questions about whether they were slow to resfonld the pandemic or close the borders or buy equipment. This is what he wants to do. The other parties, though, do not agree with the conservative leader's demand for the sheer volume for in-person sitings that he is looking for.

Rosemary:
Ok. David, I will come back to you shortly. I'm going to go back to our top story at this hour. A suspect is in custody after an active shooter's investigation. The suspect's name is gabriel wortman and he has been taken into custody by nova scotia rcmp within the last 30 minutes. But this all started to unfold yesterday evening. And mike mckay is a resident of portapique, nova scotia and he has been up all night as he says multiple homes around his are on fire. He joins us on the phone. How are you doing?

Caller:
Doing good. A little tired.

Rosemary:
I bet. When did this start for you?was it last night and what were you told?

Caller:
It was around 10:30 or 11:00 last night. We noticed police cars and then the house fire and two more fires after that. We're assuming warehousest as well. And with not much information we were a little concerned until this morning when we heard stay inside. So, we pretty much bunkered in for the time being.

Rosemary:
Did they appear to be large house fires?what can you tell me?

Caller:
Pretty large house fires, yes. And some explosions. Gas tank and propane tanks and what have you. And with no firefighter to be seen because of the other activity we were unaware of at the time. So -- [sirens]

Rosemary:
And do you know the residents of the homes?i don't know how much you could see in terms of what house was affected.

Caller:
We know a couple for sure that were kind of vizable from our yard. But the third we don't know for sure. But scary, I guess.

Rosemary:
Yeah. I can't imagine. And when you woke up this morning and found out that it was an active shooter investigation --

Caller:
We didn't wake up this morning. We were up all night.

Rosemary:
Fair enough. When you got word that that's what was actually happening and they told you to stay in your basement, I can't imagine what that must have been like.

Caller:
Well, we don't have a basement so we're still on the main floor and concerned, again, not knowing for sure what or who to be looking out for. So we didn't get a lot of information until this morning.

Rosemary:
Do you know the suspect?does his name --

Caller:
No.

Rosemary:
You said you knew the other houses. Had you been in contact with anyone in the other homes to see if they're ok?

Caller:
No. Just seing from where we're at, just seeing -- knowing where things are.

Rosemary:
And what is the presence like in portapique, now that the suspect is in custody?

Caller:
We're -- it's still pretty quiet here. Haven't seen much traffic on the road or anything. But we have to wait and see, I guess.

Rosemary:
Have police left or still there securing areas?

Caller:
From what we know, they're still here. I'm sure there will be investigations after this.

Rosemary:
I'm sure. I don't myself know much about portapique, mike. Give us a sense of how big or small or rural it is.

Caller:
Very rural. Very small community. On the water. It's cottage country here. Noise area a.-- nice area. Beautiful area. And houses are spread out. A lot of trees. So you can be in the blind a little bit.

Rosemary:
Yeah. We also have heard, and i'm sure you have now, too, that the suspect was wearing -- may be wearing an rcmp uniform and may have had some sort of car that looks like an rcmp car. How worrying is that?

Caller:
Well, that is pretty scary for, you know, people not knowing and he could have showed up on a doorstep and people thinking that he was police. That's scary.

Rosemary:
Totally. How many people are in portapique?

Caller:
A few hundred. I'm not 100% sure. It's not a huge population.

Rosemary:
And the people you know in town, they are all safe and ok?

Caller:
As far as we know, yes.

Rosemary:
Strange time, too. You're obviously staying at home because of pandemic and now this happens.

Caller:
We're just locked in a little longer.

Rosemary:
I know. I gather you're relieved?

Caller:
Yes.

Rosemary:
Yeah.

Caller:
As well as a lot of people will be, i'm sure.

Rosemary:
Thank you for talking to us. We hope you get a nap at some point and hope everybody there is safe. Appreciate it very much. That's mike mckay from portapique, nova scotia. He is one of the residents of that small town. And a it was in that town

-- TOWN JUST LAST NIGHT THAT THEY GOT HAD TWOER THERE WAS A SITUATION UNFOLDING AROUND 11:00, 11:30 P.M. LOCAL TIME AND THERE DID APPEAR TO BE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION.WE DO NOT KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE SITUATION AS OF YET.BUT POLICE SAY THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS.THEY WON'T SAY WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED AND THEY WORKED FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS OR SO TO LOCATE THE SUSPECT.A MAN BY THE NAME OF GABRIEL WORTMAN WHO, AS YOU HEARD ME ASKING MIKE THERE, APPEARED TO BE DRESSED AS AN RCMP OFFICER AND IN A CAR THAT APPEARED ALMOST TO BE A REPLICA OF AN RCMP VEHICLE, ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE RCMP.HE IS A DENTIST OF SOME -- A DENTURIST OF SOME KIND.THEY WERE VERY WORRIED FOR PEOPLE'S SAFETY.THE RCMP AT THE TIME TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND HE WAS, QUOTE, ARMED AND DANGEROUS.HE HAS BEEN IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES PICKED UP AND BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY BY THE ROLLER COASTER.MANY.WE'LL AWAIT MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE RCMP CAN TELL US ABOUT POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHY THIS MAY HAVE HAPPENED.SO WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU AS SOON AS WE GET IT, OBVIOUSLY.BUT WE ARE, AS WE DO AT THIS HOUR, WAITING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU TO EMERGE FROM HIS HOME.THERE IT IS.YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HIS FRONT DOOR BY NOW, RIDEAU COTTAGE, WHERE HE WILL BRING US UP TO DATE ON HIS GOVERNMENT'S MOVE TO CONTAIN AND COMBAT COVID-19 AND HE WOULD ALSO, I WOULD IMAGINE, LIKELY SPEAK TO THE SITUATION THAT HAS NOW BEEN, FOR NOW, IT WOULD SEEM RESOLVED IN NOVA SCOTIA.I WILL BRING IN DAVID COCHRANE AS WE STAND BY AND WAIT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER.YOU BROUGHT US UP TO DATE ON THE PARLIAMENTARY NEGOTIATIONS.

Reporter:
I have a slight update because i've been in contact with elizabeth may and to clarify the green's position, they are only in favour of sitting in person if there is a compelling reason, such as passing legislation. They don't want to sit just to have a question period. These can be done virtually and over zoom and to bring everybody together to have a question period sends the wrening message to canadians and that the government is telling everybody to stay home exempt bes us, us being members of parliament says she. They want to go to virtual as quickly and as often as possible and use that as a government accountability method, despite the glifms they've had with the technology on some of the committee hearings. For them, they say once a week with a small group of m. P.s constitutes an unreasonable risk and sends the wrong message to canadians that parliamentary should stay home. The greens don't want any in person unless it's required to vote and pass legislation as we saw with wage subsidy and business help, for example.

Marcy:
If they've done it before, sort of curious that they wouldn't find a way to do it again. And we're expecting toer that from the speaker about where they are at in terms of virtual sitings. But we know from press conferences, some cabinet ministers forget to unmute their microphones. You can imagine where you have the situation where people try to talk over one another. I'm sure it's possible. I'm just not sure how easy it will be and whether it will be the best demonstration of accountability. And the agree to suspend only goes until tomorrow. They have to reach some ort of agreement before the day is over and as we've seen throughout this pandemic, they do tend to reach agreement, but they to end do it right at the very last minute. Ok. I think mr. Trudeau, the Prime Minister, is about to come out in about a minute's time. Again, we are expecting him to perhaps bring us up to date on the negotiations of the return of the house of commons. And we expect him to address the situation that now appears, anyway, to be under control in nova scotia where a suspect has been taken into custody. He was an active shooter, the rcmp say, and they are talking about multiple victims. We don't know the extent of that, but perhaps the Prime Minister will have more to tell us right now.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
[speaking french].before we get started, I want to touch briefly on the unfolding events in portapique, nova scotia. I know we've all been watching this on the news. My heart goes out to everyone affected in what is a terrible situation. I want to thank the police for their hard work and people for cooperating are authorities.

Interpreter:
I'd like the speak briefly about the situation unfolding right now in portapique, nova scotia. I know we've all been following the news and I want you to know that our heart go out to all those affected by this event. I want to thank the authorities for their good work and everyone else for their cooperation. This morning, I also want to wish a happy orthodox easter to those celebrating today. Even if you do it on skype, I hope you can spend this special day with your family and friends.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
And a happy orthodox easter to everyone celebrating today. Even if it's just over skype. I hope you can spend this special with family and friends. Although this pandemic has affected everyone, some people have been hit especially hard. Right now, too many canadians are facing some really difficult situations. If you live with a disability, I don't have to tell you what this can look like. You might be worried about whether your support worker will be able to keep coming. You might be concerned about getting groceries or about your finances. And if you're caring for someone with a disability, you're probably anxious about getting support, too. Your voice matters. Your experience is important. And our government is listening. If this crisis has laid the gaps that still exist for far too many canadians, it is also given us an opportunity to address them. It has encouraged us to have even more meaningful conversations about how we can make our country a more inclusive and a more equitable place. Last week, minister qualtrough lunched a covid-19 disability advisory group as part of our plan to. Keep all canadians healthy, informed and safe. We're addressing key issues like equal access to health care and information as well as support on jobs and income. And we're doing all of this work with you at the table. On that note, I want to recognize the outstanding organisations across the country. Like the rick hansen foundation that are bringing these issues to the fore. You are doing inc*ep credible work. And we are proud to be your partner.[speaking french].

Interpreter:
Last week, minister qualtrough launched the disability advisory group. That is part of our plan to help everyone to stay healthy and safe. We are facing an unprecedented situation and we are now looking at the most important issue, such as equal access to health care and information. We also want to provide financial support to those who need it and we have put measures in place to protect jobs. This is work we're doing together. I want to thank all the leaders and organizers around the country that are drawing attention to particular challenges that the most vulnerable canadians are facing. Few are doing an extraordinary job and we're there to be your full partner.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
In responses to this pandemic, we've developed a three-point economic plan to help canadians get through this tough time. We introduced the canada emergency response benefit to help people who have lost their wages. We brought in new loans for businesses and we introduced the wage subsidy. But there is still work to do. There are still people to reach. That's why this past week we expanded the emergency response benefit to include workers making up to $1,000 a month, seasonal workers and those whose e. I. has recently run out. It's why we put in place new measures to support people in the energy industry, which is suffering right now. And we also brought in support for people who continue to do incredible work in the arts, culture and sports communities. And it's why we kept making attempts with the progress and territories on increasing wages for essential workers who need it. Things are tough for employers, too. So we brought in a whole range of additional support on loans and credit and for indigenous businesses and businesses in the north. And for communities that need extra support. We approved requests to have the canadian armed forces assist in long-term care facilities as well as in nunavik. I can also announce that we approved an extension for quebec to help first nations. All these measures we brought in are about helping you do the things that will get us through this. And it's working. We're seeing the numbers trend in the right direction. So we need to keep doing what we're doing and keep being extremely careful. And we will get through this together.[speaking french].

Interpreter:
From the beginning of the crisis, we have been announcing historic measures with the emergency benefit, the wage subsidy and the loans to small businesses. We are helping millions of families and workers and entrepreneurs. But there are still people we need to help. This week, we extented support through the benefit. We put in place new measures for energy sector workers, a sector particularly hard hit by the epidemic. And we also want to help people doing an extraordinary job in the arts and culture and sports communities. At the same time, we're working with the territoris to increase the wages of essential workers who need more support. Of course, this is also a difficult period for employers. Therefore, we introduced a whole series of additional measures, including loans and contributions to businesses, including for indigenous and northern businesses. And for those communities that need a little bit more help, we have approved requests for the canadian armed forces to be deployed to quebec in long-term care homes and in nunavik and the lower north shore. Today I can also announce that the rangers will be helping other communities in quebec. We introduced all of these different measures to allow you to follow the recommendations of our health experts and help us to fight this virus. And it's working. The numbers show that we're moving in the right direction. So, we must continue to stay home and be cautious. And together we will get through this. Having said that, even if we're pointing out certain encouraging trends, we must not dilute ourselves. Across this country, there are thousands of families going through terrible times. Because of this pandemic. I just want to take a moment to express my deep condolences to those who are mourning. All canadians share your sadness and they stand with you during these terrible ordeals. Know that the government is there for you and they will come through these difficult times together. We cannot see this news without thinking of the seniors in their residences that can't see their children, that can't see their grandchildren except on facetime and who are afraid, who see the news and hear about what's happening in seniors' homes across the province and across the country. And they're worried as to whether they will ever see their children or grandchildren again. It's extremely hard. And we must do everything we can for them by working together, but also by making it clear that everyone has to continue to stay home. We have to continue to slow the spread of this virus and together we will get through this.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
And because it'sunday, I want to end again by talking directly to all the kids who might be watching. This week is national volunteer week. That means we say thank you to everyone around us doing things like helping seniors get groceries or puting in a shift at a food bank. You can join in from home, too. Ask your parents if you can help them make dinner and do extra cleaning around the house. Help your brother or sister with school work. Say hi over facetime to your grandparents who I know are missing you. Young, and young at heart, we can all make a real difference. I heard a great story the other day. About a restaurant in nova scotia, the canteen. They turned the restaurant into a community kitchen where people pitch in and get meals to those in need. And there have been thousands of canadians who have already signed up through our national covid-19 volunteer improvement campaign to lighten the load on our frontline workers. Everyone can help out. Everyone can help us get through this.[speaking french].

Interpreter:
To all the children who are now at home, don't forget that we need you. Ask your parents if you can help them prepare a meal or help with the cleaning. Help your brother or your sister with their homework. Say hello on facetime to your grandparents who miss you. We are all able to do our best and make this a better place. And at this time, as we're facing a challenge like we've never seen before, we all have a chances to contribute. But I know that we will all continue to do our part. Thank you very much.

[SPEAKING FRENCH].OPERATOR:
Merci. Thank you. First question, the "globe and mail".your line is open. Please go ahead.

Reporter:
Good morning, Prime Minister. Thank you for taking our questions. My question is with regard to the government's decision to tighten the scrutiny of forced takeovers of canadian firms impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. Why is this decision important and why did you take this decision a month after european countries started doing this?

Prime Minister Trudeau:s WE RECOGNIZE THAT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE LOOKING AT THEIR OWN REGIMES AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE VULNERABLE BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO OUR RECOVERY WHO ARE PERHAPS EXPOSED TO FOREIGN PURCHASES IN A VULNERABLE TIME, THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AND ARE TAKEN CARE OF.WE'LL BE STRENGTHENING OUR OVERSIGHT AND PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS CRISIS.[SPEAKING FRENCH].

Interpreter:
We recognize it is important in this time of economic slowdown and vulnerability for many businesses that there are not people or companies overseas that are trying to take advantage of this situation to invest in canadian companies which normally would not be as a result negotiable that type of takeover. And that is why we're talking about just how important these measures are to ensure the protection of our industries and our economy.

Caller:
Are you aware of any foreign takeover deals that are occurring or are there any sectors that you're concerned about?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
Certainly as we look at challenges around supply chains for essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment as we strengthen our own domestic industry and production, we wouldn't want a foreign investor toic that production that is being made for canadians in this moment of crisis and send it overseas. We also recognize that there are perhaps some startups that we would want to remain canadian for the coming years that could be exposed to predatory foreign investors. This is something that, of course, we'll be keeping an eye on.

THANK YOU.[SPEAKING FRENCH].OPERATOR:
Thank you. Merci.[speaking french].

Reporter:
Bonjour.[speaking french].

Interpreter:
Good morning, mr. Trudeau. What can you tell us about the negotiations regarding the reconvening of parliament next week and if the 338 m. P.s have to be recalled tomorrow. Whose fault will it be?well, we're very concerned about the fact that we have not yet reached an agreement with all the opposition partis to not come back tomorrow morning. The current situation is that parliament is supposed to resume tomorrow on the 20th of april with 338 m. P.s from every corner of the country and their team, their staff, security guards and administrative personnel and, of course, we're not in a situation where that should be happening. We need a parliament that works. We need to do that in a responsible way. That's why we've had some good conversations with most of the parties and we're close to an agreement to be able to come back every week to ensure that they can ask questions and we can move forward with legislation. But the conservatives are resisting that reasonable solution at this time. But we do hope that this can be resolved soon. Follow-up?yes. So you're saying that it's the conservatives. Now you were talking to children earlier because it's sunday. So, what kind of image does this present if everyone is making sacrifices and does it really show that politicians are not able to agree at such a difficult time?well, that's a very good question, lena. And for me it is very frustrating. Because we're clearly hearing from our experts and public health authorities that we must continue to make the responsible choices and limit our movements and seems to me that it's fairly clear that parliament should not return in the same manner as before, starting tomorrow. I very much believe that i's extremely important to continue to support our democracy and keep our *ins using -- institutions working and i'm willing to answer questions. I take questions from the media every day and I think opposition m. P.s should have the chance to also ask questions as well and that is why we made a proposal that seems very reasonable to all the other parties but the conservatives. I don't know. I think you'll have to ask him, ask them what their approach is. And why they're unreasonable in this situation.

Prime Minister Trudeau:s WE'RE IN A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES, OUR EXPERTS AND COMMON SENSE TELLS US WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LIMIT OUR MOVEMENTS, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK FROM HOME.WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE KEPT SAFE FROM FURTHER SPREAD OF THIS PANDEMIC.THAT'S WHY IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO RESUME TOMORROW, AS SCHEDULED, ON APRIL 20 WITH 338 M.P.s, THEIR STAFF, SUPPORT STAFF IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, SECURITY, PEOPLE COMING IN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT.WE HAVE PROPOSED, AND IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY -- LARGELY ACCEPTED BY THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES.WE SHOULD HAVE PARLIAMENT THAT FUNCTIONS, BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY.THAT'S WHY COMING BACK EVERY WEEK FOR QUESTIONS AND FOR WORK ON PASSING NEW LEGISLATION IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REASONABLE AND IS ACCEPTABLE TO MOST PARTIES.I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO BE TAKE QUESTIONS EVERY DAY FROM MEDIA AND LOOKING TO WARD TO TAKING QUESTIONS FROM OPPOSITION PARTIES BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY AND RIGHT NOW THE CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT TAKING A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH.

THANK YOU.MERCI.QUESTION?OPERATOR:
Next question, canadian press. Please go ahead.

Reporter:
Yes, Prime Minister. Thank you for talking to us. The n. D.p. Is asking for, in terms of parliamentary sitings, one in-person day and two virtual sitings. You proposed only one virtual sitting. Can you explain why two is unaccepting?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
I think it is important that we have in-person sitings and one a week seems about the right number in a reduced fashion. But we also have been clear from the very beginning that we think there should be virtual sittings to allow parliamentarians from across the country who aren't within driving distance of ottawa to continue to participate and that is why we have been pushing for virtual sittings. We heard that they are incapable of standing up virtual sittings for this coming week. But we are very open to increasing them over the subsequent weeks because it's important that we be able to hear from all parliamentarians.

Reporter:
And there is report of a deal that has been reached. Can you confirm that a deal has been reached with the opposition partis?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
I can't confirm anything like that. As I came out this morning, I heard that we were very close on it. But I haven't in the past half hour got notice that there was a deal. It seems reasonable that we can agree that there needs to be a parliament functioning responsibly in this difficult time. Most parties have responsible proposals forward and I certainly hope that the conservatives will agree to doing the responsible thing here. Operator: [speaking french].

Interpreter:
Now the virtual sitings. What would they look like in concrete terms, mr. Trudeau?well, there are various proposals that the house of commons is looking at now. The idea is for members of parliament across the country to make speeches and ask questions via video conferencing with the same rights and ability to speak as people current will I have inside the house of commons. There would be some in the house and other m. P.s attending virtually. That is why the house of commons has asked for more time to get this ready. In your speech, you said that thousands of families are going through a terrible time and premier legault said yesterday that his government was not properly prepared for this pandemic. You said in the past that there will be a time for a postmortem. After a month of this crisis, there are question asked across the country. Do you think that your government was adequately prepared for this pandemic?i think when we're in the middle of the crisis and witness the tragedies, we will never fully be prepared. At the same time, we know that canadian and the different levels of government and organisations and everyone have come together to try and put in place measures to protect people and slow the spread of this virus. In a positive way compared to other countries. But even if we end up having a better history than other countries, let's not forget this is a terrible tragedy for too many families out there and we all have a responsibility to do our very best to ensure that we come out of this tragedy and this crisis without too many additional tragedies. Could you tell me why three in-person sitings per week with reduced numbers is unreasonable?well, I think we know that all parliamentarians cannot return to the house of commons. There are people who live in provinces that are far away from ottawa and cannot return. And that is why we've been saying it's very important to have virtual sittings so that people can participate in order to represent their community during this crisis. At the same time, in being there to answer questions regularly, it is also important for democracy and our canadians. It's fine to take media questions here. I do that about every day and parliamentarians have a role to play and the proposal we made for a session or a sitting every week was accepted by most of the parties as being a reasonable compromise during this crisis. It is important to remember that people are elected from all corners of this country to be their community's voice in parliament. Particularly in a crime of crisis, it is important to look at virtual ways that allow members from every corner of the country to engage in parliamentary debate and discussion and not just those who have the opportunity to proximity to be around the national capital region. That is why we've been pushing the virtual sittings. We know that accountability is important and taking questions every day from the media is a good thing. But it is also important that parliamentarians and opposition politicians go et to ask questions of the government which is why we proposed parliaments sit every fwhaoek reduced fashion and that is a proposal that was accepted by most parties. The conservatives still need to work on it a little bit in terms of their own reflection.

Interpreter:
Would you be open to there being several virtual sitings per week once that starts happening, three or four, for example?right now the opposition partis can not ask you to account every single day. And that is why they're unhappy. Would you be in favour of several virtual sittings?i can tell you that the proposals made by the opposition parties and the issues they are raising in terms of criticizing the government are, you know, hear in the media and we have adjusted our proposal and are trying to ensure that we're doing everything we can to respond to real needs across the country. We are coming to functioning parliament. It's extremely important that that be the case. That is why we're trying to find a solution and I can tell you that most opposition party dos agree, only the conservatives may force us to come back tomorrow morning with 338 members of parliament in the house of commons.

Reporter:
You just said that you respect parliament and believe in accountability. Why is your party still hallinging at the last minute over terms of the sitting. Why is this so complicated?

Prime Minister Trudeau:s WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHERE I SAID WE HAVE A PROPOSAL TO BRING BACK PARLIAMENT EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING AND LOOKING AT VIRTUAL SITTINGS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN.THIS HAS BEEN OUR POSITION AND WE'RE  CONSISTENTLY ON THAT POSITION.MOST OPPOSITION PARTIES FOUND THIS TO BE REASONABLE.THERE IS ONE PARTY, AND BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS SCHEDULED TO RESUME TOMORROW MORNING, THERE IS REQUIRED TO BE UNANIMOUS CONSENT BY THE PARTIES TO NOT COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING AND THE CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT WANTING TO BE REASONABLE IN THIS, I THINK.

Reporter:
Australia and other companies are calling for an independent investigation into the origins of covid-19 outbreak in china. You said this is not the time to point fingers or assign blame. Are you supportive of this investigation in the future and do you believe that china responded and reported adequately?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
I think it is important that we understand what happened and ask tough questions of all countries involved, including china. This is something that we need to pursue. My priority right now and the priority for countries around the world needs to be doing everything we can to keep our people safe and make sure that we have the resources necessary to protect our citizens and get through this. And that will always be my focus.[speaking french].

Interpreter:
We recognize that there are important questions to be asked and there needs to be reflection on what happened and what kind of responsibility some  countries have, including china. But our priority must be how we're going to protect our own citizens now and tomorrow. How we can ensure that we have everything we need to keep ourselves safe.

Reporter:
Prime minister, a correctional facility near montreal has confirmed dozens of covid-19 cases and the same is true with other facilities across the country, including one near vancouver. What are you doing to protect the incarcerated population and the staff in these facilities to stop the spread of covid-19.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
From the beginning, service canada has taken measures to protect staff and inmates in these facilities, including eliminating visits, reducing trantioner ifs, looking at measures including staggered timetables to keep inmates and staff more separate from each other, ensuring that there are different mechanisms in place and those reflections are ongoing. We're always looking for new ways to ensure protection of those canadians in those facilities.

Reporter:
Some provinces have had to cut  elective surgeris in hospitals to manage covid-19 patients or prepare for them. Canada's already -- canada already has long wait lists for some procedures. Is the federal government going to assist provinces to make sure that these existing backlogs aren't amplified wasn't we're through this?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
We have a tremendous amount of confidence that provinces are going to be able to continue to manage their health care systems appropriately. We sent them half a billion in new resources to ensure that they're able to continue with this crisis. One of the key elements through this crisis was ensuring that if more and more people got infected, there would still be emergency beds for them. There would still be intensive care units available for them to deal with the very real challenges of covid-19 and prevent the death rates from skyrocketing as they have in other countries where their medical systems were overwhelmed. I think canadians understand how important it is to make it through this crisis as quickly as possible so we can get back to normal. But getting through it as quickly as possible means being very careful about what we're doing right now.

Reporter:
Good morning, in austria, for example, they have a plan to get businesses re-opened and doing it in a two-week process. They open a small business, monitor for two weeks, if the cases don't go up, they continue with hotels, restaurants, etc. Provinces here in canada have plans that they're announcing on how they're going to do that. I'm wondering what the coordination is between your government and the provinces. Will the federal government put a plan up and what are you saying action which businesses should be able to re-open and when?

Prime Minister Trudeau:
Many of the decisions around what makes sense in terms of a careful restarting of the economy are much more appropriately made at the provincial level. Given both provincial authorities and the reality that the shape of this pandemic is very, very different in different parts of the country. What we are working on coordinating with the provinces is a set of principles and approaches that can be applied at different moments and in different ways across the country. We want to be there to ensure that there is a testing capacity, that we are supporting on contact tracing and we're remaining consistent in the messages that canadians are hearing from different orders of government across the country, about how to be very, very careful to not allow for a resurge enls of covid-19 just as restrictions start being eased. These conversations are very much live with the provinces right now. We are listening very carefully to what experts and looking very carefully at what is working and has worked in other  jurisdictions and how and if that can be adapted to us. We recognized from the begining that we have been slightly slower. We were able to hold off the pace of the virus in canada for a few more weeks and many other places and, therefore, we can take advantage of learning what works in different situations to adapt it to canada. We have been extremely thoughtful about that'sing. Again, people need to know it 's not going to suddenly re-open in any part of the country overnight to what it was before. We are going to have to be very, very careful, very gradual, very progressive if we are to prevend the kind of resurgence that would send us all back into lockdown as we were before. We want to make sure that what we're doing now is not for nothing. That we managed to get through this with the containment and control approaches that the proper measures will allow for.

Interpreter:
We know that people want to know when this is going to end and when we can relax certain restrictions. But we have a responsibility to be very careful, to do things properly and gradually and to be extremely vigilant. We're taking inspiration from what's been done elsewhere in the world and their success and there are challenges as well. In different parts of the country, and choices are being made and not necessarily the same choices. As the federal government, we're trying to co-ordinate our efforts so that the understand lying principles with respect to that gradual recovery will be allowed the same way across the country.



Reporter:
There are reports of 12 people sickened in alberta and other places of the country from that. Should measures be in place to make sure that returning workers isolate whether or not they have symptoms.

Prime Minister Trudeau:
We all understand how important it is to keep workers in essential businesses, workers who continue to work as safe as possible. Safety of workers, of their families as well needs to be the primary consideration of any government and I certainly expect that to be that one as well.

[SPEAKING FRENCH].

Rosemary:
The Prime Minister of canada with his daily briefing, daily update on his government's approach to fighting the pandemic. I'll bring in the cbc's david cochrane. A couple of points I would make, david, from listening to the Prime Minister. There is no one, not any party that is asking for all m. Performs to return tomorrow. So, that just in case people got that impression. And there is nothing that would require all 338 m. P.s to come to ottawa tomorrow. They could continue to do their parliamentary work in their ridings if they chose not to come. But further to that, as they were speaking, the n. D.p. Made clear that no matter what happens tomorrow there will only be three of the m. P.s here tomorrow. I don't want people to go away with the impression that they will suddenly, if there is no deal, be 338 m. P.s in the house of commons. That's the image that he left with people and that is the wrong impression.

Reporter:
They are saying that conservatives are not taking a responsible approach wanting a minimum of three in-person sitings a week. So they can have question period as much as they want during this pandemic, wanting to hold the government to account for the actions it's take or not taking. The greens wanting to go completely virtual and the liberals and the n. D.p. Having an agreement to do one day in-person and then two days virtual. No. There is no requirement for all 338 to come back and nobody necessarily wants that. Absent an agreement, it is possible that an undetermined number of m. Performs could come back to parliament and insist on taking their seat. There was some unpredictability even when there was an agreement tos pa it a several weeks ago. Scott reid showed up to protest what was being done. So negotiations are continuing with public pronouncements being made by political leaders t. Conservatives essentially saying trudeau is not taking the accountable approach and if he can take questions from reporters every day and ministers can hold press conferences every day sitting next to dr. Tam and dr. Njoo, why can't they go down the hall into the house of commons and give some answers to the dully-elected members of the house of commons. There is no consensus on this. The bulk of the parties, which is the majority of the m. Performs, think that the conservatives are asking for too much. And the conservatives saying the government giving too little.

Rosemary:
Ok. Thank you for your help with your coverage. I appreciate that. And we'll have an update on whether they'll return in some way by the end of the day. Let's go to our breaking news in nova scotia. Because the Prime Minister also talked about that. Saying that thanks people in the area and police for following instructions saying that the suspect in an active shooter investigation is in custody. We're told there are multiple victims. Shaina luck is live in great village, not far from where the events unfolded. What can you tell us?

Reporter:
The shooter has been identified by the rcmp as 51-year-old -- excuse me -- his last name is wortman and it has been such a -- gabriel wortman -- it's scaped me fromm. It began last night in portapique, probably about 10 -- excuse me -- it's about 10 minutes up the road from where i'm standing. I'm standing in great village right now. Portapique is not too far away. It began last night around 11:30. With some kind of violent incident causing multiple victims. We don't know yet whether those victims are dead or whether they're injured. We don't know how many of them, whether multiple victims means two or more. We do know that probably about an hour ago, maybe a little more than that, wortman was apprehended by the rcmp on highway 102. He was heading toward halifax in dartmouth. I can tell you a little bit more about wortman now. We know that he is a denturist. The rcmp at one point said he might have access to a replica or some car that looked like an rcmp car or rcmp uniform but they were very clear he does not work for the rcmp. We know that he is a denturist. We know that he owns multiple properties around nova scotia. Including several properties in portapique. Gabriel wortman has a business in dartmouth, a denturist business. So, we can tell you that, you know, he is -- we've been speaking over the phone with people in the community who tell us that he was fairly well known within portapique. Some people are saying that he was well-liked. So this is certainly an unfolding incident and we expect to get more from the rcmp this afternoon.

Rosemary:
Do we have a time for that yet?any sense when that might happen?

Reporter:
No, we don't know yet. The rcmp has been giving us information all morning. They've been using twitter to get that out there and there is a press conference coming but no timeline on that as of yet.

Rosemary:
I appreciate the new detheys you found out about the suspect, gabriel wortman and a  gentleman earlier said he heard fires and propane blowing, maybe propane attached to the homes. But didn't really have a sense of how things were unfolding. I just want to reiterate that point, though, about the rcmp vehicle and potentially uniform. Because at one point the suspect did change cars. Can you just tell people what we know about that car?

Reporter:
We know that the rcmp used twitter, as i've been saying, they've been using that a lot. The suspect was traveling in an rcmp -- what looked like an rcmp vehicle and what looked like an rcmp uniform. We don't know too much about how he got those items or where exactly they came from, whether they were legitimate items or not. But he was traveling in an rcmp vehicle and then shortly after that, the rcmp told us that he had switched to a silver s. U.v. Chevy tracker. We believe that's how it played out.
