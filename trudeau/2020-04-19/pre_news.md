We are standing by for the Prime Minister's daily update on the federal responses to the pandemi
But, of course, we are also at this hour tracking breaking news out of Nova Scoti
RCMP say they now have a shooting suspect in custod
The suspect has been on the run for several tense hours, following what is being described as a violent incident in a small community near  We don't know a lot mor
But we will expect the Prime Minister might likely address the situation now that the suspect is in custod
Let's begin with that breaking news story in Nova Scoti
Shaina luck joins me from great village, close to where some of this morning's events unfolde
and this has been going on for hour
What can you tell us about how it's played out?



**Reporter**:
Well, as you said, the suspect -- we know from RCMP that gunman is now in custody and we know that he has been on the run for approximately 12 hour
The RCMP tell us that he was tracked down between here and  We last know that he was seen traveling on highway 10
That is the highway, the major highway that runs between here and the cit
About 45 kilometres away from where I a
and he was last seen traveling in a small silver SUV We had heard from police that he might have been wearing an RCMP uniform or what looked like an RCMP unifor
At one point, he was also traveling, they believed, in a car that looked like an RCMP ca
But the RCMP put out a heavy presence on that highway and they were able to apprehend him probably we first got word of that maybe just 20 minutes ag
Now we do know that this came out of some kind of incident that happened last night around 11:3
Tha
Happened in the town just about 10 minutes up the road from m
It's called  a small communit
We know that there are multiple victim
We don't know how many and we don't know how badly they are injure
and we do expect there will be an update from the RCMP at some point this afternoo
But for now we know the suspect is in custod




**Rosemary**:
So many unusual parts to this stor
He is in custody now as you sa
But the fact he did seem to be impersonating or pretending to be RCMP officer, the RCMP  a lot of information about that as wel


YES, THAT'S RIGHT.WE DO KNOW FROM THE RCMP THAT HE IS NOT ACTUALLY AN RCMP OFFICER.WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW EXACTLY HE CAME TO HAVE THAT RCMP VEHICLE AND RCMP UNIFORM, WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE ARTICLES.WE DO KNOW THAT HE IS NOT AN RCMP EMPLOYEE.CBC HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT HE IS A VENTURIS


**Rosemary**:
O
Appreciate tha
The cbc's Shaina luck reporting from great village, Nova Scoti
To remind you a little bit about how that unfolded, starting at 11:30 last nigh
Near  there was a tweet from the RCMP telling people that there was a situation unfolding, telling them that there was an active shoote
Earlier this morning, telling them to stay in their homes and go to their basements in order to stay saf
There was a lot of communication between local RCMP on the ground via Twitter and other means to make sure that residents didn't get hurt furthe
They now say that the suspect, gunman  is in custody and they did manage to apprehend him there somewhere along the highway near  Nova Scotia and, again, we do know that there are multiple victim
We don't know if they have been injured or kille
We expect the RCMP in Nova Scotia to update us the moment we hear more about that situatio
So obviously important, breaking news out of Nova Scoti
We'll continue to track i
At this hour, we're expecting to hear from Prime Minister Justin  doing his daily briefing to the nation around his government's response to  So let's bring in David  I expect that the Prime Minister will probably say something about this incident in Nova Scotia firs
and maybe give us some details if he has any,  What else are we expecting from him today?



**Reporter**:
I'm not sure we'll get much in the way of a significant news announcement toda
But the news that is happening here in Ottawa is the negotiations happening behind the scenes with all the part is to figure out what to do about the house of commons which is due to come back in full force with all 388 MP's scheduled to come back and take their seats in the middle of a pandemic, an   one is super keen to have at al
There are talks of reduced sitings  reduced numbers, but they are not all the way down ye
The liberals and new democrats have reached an agreement in the last 20 minutes as far as I can tell, that they would get the support of liberal NDP  have one sitting this week with a lot of time dedicated to question period, the equivalents of a week of question period happening in one city and then move into one virtual sitting next week and the week after that, one in person and two virtual sitings and that would become the template for the house of commons on how it would function going forwar
This is a move from the liberals who wanted one sitting and one virtual sitting as the baseline each wee
They decided to go up to two to satisfy the new democrat
The greens and bloc quÉbÉcois, would go along with thi
Andrew scheer is keen to have parliament come back and resume its normal function in what are abnormal times with a reduced sittin
Something like we saw before and theys   of 30 to 40MPs  around the ottawa  The conservatives started with a request or demand for four in-person sitings as  negotiations have gone on, they have countered with three in-person siting
The liberals,  greens, the bloc, they don't want to go to tha
You can reduce the number of MPs, but you  staff, broadcasters, political staff, clerks and dozens and dozens of people would go into the west block and even last time with the reduced sitings, elizabeth may and  complained that when you left your seats there's lots of seat
and when you head back, there's too many support staff for people to safely social distanc
These are the behind the scenes conversations in ottaw
What is  compromise?four of the parties have largely found an agreement that function
The conservatives are not on board with that yet and we'll hear from andrew scheer a little   this afternoon to see what he has to say on thi


**Rosemary**:
I realise for people that that is a lot of days and a lot of information about what's trying to go on her
But essentially they're trying to find a way for parliamentarians to do their work in some capacity inside the house of commons and for the government to answer questions and be held to account for decisions that it's makin
It is vitally importan
I don't think anyone disagrees with tha


**Reporter**:
Everything is suspended and put on hol
But democracy hasn't been abandoned in Canad
The house normally sits five days a week with people flying in from all over the country, there's no way for that to happen safely and practicall
So, the liberals wanted to have one sitting day a week with an online virtual da
They are trying to find a solution for everybod
You can understand the em pulse of the conservatives of wanting to have an opportunity to question the Prime Minister and the various minister
We're up to almost $300 billion in aid that has been put on the table by the governmen
You know, a full year's budget is normally about $350 billio
So, they have done almost a year of spending in a matter of four or five week
As the urgent needs caused by COVID-19 keep expanding and growing and more and more people ar
Captured by these  We've seen Andrew schemer come back to Ottawa with his family and holding daily press conference
and his argument is that this is necessary to hold the government to account by answering clear and specific questions about whether they were slow to  the pandemic or close the borders or buy equipmen
This is what he wants to d
The other parties, though, do not agree with the conservative leader's demand for the sheer volume for in-person sitings  he is looking fo


**Rosemary**:

That's mike McKay from  Nova Scoti
He is one of the residents of that small tow
and a it was in that town



-- TOWN JUST LAST NIGHT THAT THEY GOT HAD TWOER THERE WAS A SITUATION UNFOLDING AROUND 11:00, 11:30 P.
LOCAL TIME AND THERE DID APPEAR TO BE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION.WE DO NOT KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE SITUATION AS OF YET.BUT POLICE SAY THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS.THEY WON'T SAY WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED AND THEY WORKED FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS OR SO TO LOCATE THE SUSPECT.A MAN BY THE NAME OF GABRIEL WORTMAN WHO, AS YOU HEARD ME ASKING MIKE THERE, APPEARED TO BE DRESSED AS AN RCMP OFFICER AND IN A CAR THAT APPEARED ALMOST TO BE A REPLICA OF AN RCMP VEHICLE, ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE RCMP.HE IS A DENTIST OF SOME -- A DENTURIST OF SOME KIND.THEY WERE VERY WORRIED FOR PEOPLE'S SAFETY.THE RCMP AT THE TIME TELLING PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND HE WAS, QUOTE, ARMED AND DANGEROUS.HE HAS BEEN IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES PICKED UP AND BROUGHT INTO CUSTODY BY THE ROLLER COASTER.MANY.WE'LL AWAIT MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE RCMP CAN TELL US ABOUT POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHY THIS MAY HAVE HAPPENED.SO WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU AS SOON AS WE GET IT, OBVIOUSLY.BUT WE ARE, AS WE DO AT THIS HOUR, WAITING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU TO EMERGE FROM HIS HOME.THERE IT IS.YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HIS FRONT DOOR BY NOW, RIDEAU COTTAGE, WHERE HE WILL BRING US UP TO DATE ON HIS GOVERNMENT'S MOVE TO CONTAIN AND COMBAT COVID-19 AND HE WOULD ALSO, I WOULD IMAGINE, LIKELY SPEAK TO THE SITUATION THAT HAS NOW BEEN, FOR NOW, IT WOULD SEEM RESOLVED IN NOVA SCOTIA.I WILL BRING IN DAVID COCHRANE AS WE STAND BY AND WAIT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER.YOU BROUGHT US UP TO DATE ON THE PARLIAMENTARY NEGOTIATION


**Reporter**:
I have a slight update because I've been in contact with Elizabeth may and to clarify the green's position, they are only in favour of sitting in person if there is a compelling reason, such as passing legislatio
They don't want to sit just to have a question perio
These can be done virtually and over zoom and to bring everybody together to have a question period sends the weening message to Canadians and that the government is telling everybody to stay home exempt bees us, us being members of parliament says sh
They want to go to virtual as quickly and as often as possible and use that as a government accountability method, despite the  they've had with the technology on some of the committee hearing
For them, they say once a week with a small group of MP's constitutes an unreasonable risk and sends the wrong message to Canadians that parliamentary should stay hom
The greens don't want any in person unless it's required to vote and pass legislation as we saw with wage subsidy and business help, for exampl


**Marcy**:
If they've done it before, sort of curious that they wouldn't find a way to do it agai
and we're expecting tier that from the speaker about where they are at in terms of virtual  But we know from press conferences, some cabinet ministers forget to  their microphone
You can imagine where you have the situation where people try to talk over one anothe
I'm sure it's possibl
I'm just not sure how easy it will be and whether it will be the best demonstration of accountabilit
and the agree to suspend only goes until tomorro
They have to reach some Oort of agreement before the day is over and as we've seen throughout this pandemic, they do tend to reach agreement, but they to end do it right at the very last minut
O
I think  Trudeau, the Prime Minister, is about to come out in about a minute's tim
Again, we are expecting him to perhaps bring us up to date on the negotiations of the return of the house of common
and we expect him to address the situation that now appears, anyway, to be under control in Nova Scotia where a suspect has been taken into custod
He was an active shooter, the RCMP say, and they are talking about multiple victim
We don't know the extent of that, but perhaps the Prime Minister will have more to tell us right no
