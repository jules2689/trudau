We are standing by, as we do every day almost to hear from the Prime Minister for his daily update on the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemi
Yesterday Justin Trudeau unveiled more than $2 billion in rescue money for Canada's slumping energy sector and other key industries like touris
Today we are expecting to hear more about additional help for indigenous businesses that may be taking a due to the pandemi
Justin Trudeau is also addressing the nation on a day that the Canadian military begin an operation to combat  125 personnel are being deployed to quÉbec to assist some overwhelmed staff in the province's long-term care home
QuÉbec requested that had he been in an effort to contain thedeadly  that are sweeping through the facilities are and of course in the province of Ontario as wel
That is a scene you are familiarwith  this stage, the front door at the Prime Minister's residence, Rideau  We will hear from him in 15 minutes' tim
I want to bring in Catharine   is here to help with coverag
More than half a million tests have been completed and testing is important to get a handle on things to allow the economy to reopen and restrictions to loose
The Prime Minister has been asked those questions virtually every day this wee


**Catherine**:
That's righ
He says it's key to moving forwar
Any attempt to reopen the economy will depend on testin
The world health organization, an organization that we should say is under added scrutiny, bu tit put forward this week six criteria for any jurisdiction that's looking at moving forward and widespread testing would be a part of tha
Canada, according to many experts, is not at a point to reopen the econom
Even beyond that there is a debate of larger jurisdictions, notably Ontario, they are still trying to ramp up to a level that everyone is happy with to deal with the situation as it is, let alone allow people to return to people's lives not as normal, not to some sense of normalc


**Rosemary**:
BC is already having that conversatio
Of course they were testing at much higher rate than other provinces and according to their public health officer, Bonnie  have flattened out the curv
There was a move last night that came late in the day by the federal government to start I guess putting different measures in place as things ease u


**Catherine**:
That's righ
Anyone now who enters an airport, anyone who is doing any airline travel will need to weary non-medical mask, a cloth facecoverin
 we're talking about membersof  general public, they do not want people using those medical masks, but more and morepeople  have gone out of their house see people with those mask
If you're in an airport or anywhere you cannot maintain that physical distancing, you will have to wear a face coverin
That would be going through security or an ID check, border checks, getting on the plane itsel
Monday at noon you will be expected to have some sort of face coverin
There will be exceptions for people under the age of 2 and people who have mobility issue
This is for moments in the airport where you wouldn't be able to maintain safe physical distancin
This also came with guidelines for other modes of transportation as wel
This raises questions about other places in society where people are unable to maintain that 2-metre distance as well, rosi
 heard from D
   briefing, could we see a scenario where there is widespread guidance that Canadians should be or must be wearing masks when they go outsid
Obviously that would be quite anevolution  the course of thelast  week
First they were saying, no, theydidn't want to see people wearing masks and people would be touching their fac
Now the public health officials are saying, if you'd like to, you ma
and now D
  the science is evolvin


**Rosemary**:
Now new York state is saying you have to wear a mask on things like public transi
As restrictions are eased, other measures have to come into pla
 I'll come back to you shortly as we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister in  Obviously the coronavirus continues to claim lives in long-term care facilitie
More than half of the deaths in this country have occurred in those place
Because of that, some family members are choosing to bring their family members hom
Ilene smyth is one of those who removed her mother from a care home earlier this wee
Good to see yo


**Interview**:
Thank yo


**Rosemary**:
How is your mother doing, 



**Interview**:
Mom's doing very wel
She's obviously happy to be home with famil
It's a challeng
She has dementi
She's unable to follow directions and, you know, she could possibly have mood change sand all tha
But My husband is home as wel
So between both of us, we're managing pretty wel


**Rosemary**:
Good mornin
I'm glad to hear tha
Explain to people how you came to this decision, where your mom, who you mentioned has dementia, that your mother needed to come live with you fora period of tim


**Interview**:
Well, about the third week in march I was reading the news and listening to what was happening in long-term care and it became very scar
I mean, a lot of people were dyin
There was no hel
The personal support workers forscared  go and work at a lot of these home
So My fear was that My mother would die alon
She's unable to follow any sort of isolatio
So it became a nightmare for m
Then I got a letter from the home stating that they're not going to be transporting the seniors who get sick to the hospita
In other words, a similar situation who gets the ventilator, I understan
But at that point there was -- you know, they were so low supplied with PPE,  know, essential
So when I heard families on tv and heard of families in a nightmare where a parent would die and they wouldn't even know where the parent wen
So they were having nightmares about tha
In the end I made the decision that after doing some calls to the government and finding out where I stood exactly to bring My mother hom


**Rosemary**:
Were there cases  at the time in her residence or have there been since?



**Interview**:
No, there were no proven cases of  which gave me a good in to get My mother ou
Because I'm not sure what the situation would be had there been one contracted ther


**Rosemary**:
and I believe you're a part-time nurse or you were working as a part-time nurse, so that gives you an advantage that other people might not have because it is a lot to take o
How much of a factor is that?



**Interview**:
Yes, well I still work in a doctor's office in Barrie and I do relief, but right now the count is way dow
So I had this opportunity to be hom
As well -- and My husband as wel
So between the two of us, you know, we made that decisio
and I think I did make it at the right tim
Yes, so that made it possible for m
I had had My mother prior to her going and being crises getting admitted into the home that gave me an advantag


**Rosemary**:
Does it worry you about having to send her back?because, if anything, this pandemic has exposed, eileen,  long-term care homes are obviously struggling during thispandemic, but  be we are not doing enough for older canadiansacross the 



**Interview**:
Well, the government could be a little more lenient to families who want to take their loved ones hom
It was a real dilemma for me because when I called the  the ministry of health, the lady told me that My mother would lose her bed, that she would go on the waiting list as a  and not sure when she would get back i
My question to her was is the pre-admit  or below the crises list?because I know the crises list is probably in a couple thousan
She couldn't answer that, but she did leave the phone and scamback with an  and said it was below the crises lis
At that point I e-mailed My local MP
and voiced My  and also e-mailed -- youknow, a detailed e-mai
I  back from that office three days late
and I was -- he said he would put it to his superio
But I had not heard anything sinc
The last phone call was to ccac who deals with mom's particular  She explained to me that My mother would go on a re-admit list, but she would be a priority at the very top if I call them in the 90-day span from now or this past week, theni won't have to go through the  so that the next bed that becomes available at the home will be available to he
Now, if I go past the 90 days --as you said, this may go on -- then what am I going to do?so that's an issue for sur


**Rosemary**:
All right,  I know many people are struggling with these same issues and it was a difficult decision for you to mak
I can tell your mom is still very much full of life and is happy to be ther
I wish you good health and take car


**Interview**:
Thank you very muc

Eileen smith in barrier Ontari
In Ontario there are more than 100 long-term care homes who have outbreaks of COVID-1
 we're talking about almost one in six home
That has been the picture, not only in Ontario but definitely in quÉbec and to some extent in British Columbia as wel
Let's go to the cbc's megan   vancouver  BC is ahead of the curve, has flattened the curve, and is now already talking about ways to reopen and what that might look lik


**Megan**:
Yeah, rosier we're seeing data coming out of BC and D
Bonnie Henry being cautiously optimistic that some restrictions are being lifte
We're seeing a slow down in the increase in cases across the country in particular in  in quÉbeCBC is also changing the way that it's doing its modellin
It used to compare the number of cases to those in Italy or  in china, those real hot spots, the epicentres of  Now they are not comparing the worst-case scenario from there, looking at what could perhaps happen to our medical system here because we are starting to see this flattening of the curv
Now officials here are starting to develop new models, looking at the cases that are happening short term, and projecting those, assuming there is no change in the current measure
They're also looking at what could happen if they start to ease some of the physical distancing restriction
We say that now with the restrictions in place, contacts between british  is 30% of norma
They do say they could go up to 60% of normal and not see a reemergence of COVID-19  BCthey  still looking ahead at that second wave that we keep talking abou
The officials here are preparingfor  and adjusting their modelling ther


**Rosemary**:
Megan bachelor in  a different picture on the west coas
That is the issue with COVID-19 is that the chief public health officer, D
Theresa tam, has talked about regional epidemic
Every province looks a little bit differen
So easing back some of the restrictions will happen on different timetables in different parts of this countr
and that will make it challenging likely for the federal government, who only has so much say how this is going  As we wait for the Prime Minister, he is expected to be on tim
I'll bring back My colleague Catharine  but I may cut you of
Yesterday the Prime Minister made significant announcements in terms of mone
One of them was to address the oil and gas sector, although it was in no way a bailou
There was criticism in industry that this is not enough to get them through everythin
The premier was also very welcoming to it, as were is many many environmentalist


**Catherine**:
Indee
They put together $
7 billion to deal with orphaned wells as well as another chunk of money -- and I am watching the doorway as you are -- to help those in the oil and gas industry embrace I guess I could say new methane emission
This is something industry expressed concern about, whether or not they could do i
The government is putting forward this money to assist with tha
That is why they're getting the thumbs up from many environmentalists, helping the oil and gas industry reach a environmental bar is good way to spend the mone
The next question is the number of jobs create by thi
In the cases of the orphaned wells, this is thousands of jobs they are going to creat
I can see the Prime Ministe


**Rosemary**:
Let's go to hi
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada speakin
