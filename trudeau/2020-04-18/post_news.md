**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister of canada on this saturday morning, briefing canadians on his government's actions to fight covid-19. Let's bring in the cbc's catharine cullen. Catharine, i'll pick up where the Prime Minister left off. It is of interest in ottawa, butit should be of interest to everyone. If no agreement is reached, 338 people have to get back here formonday for parliament to sit.

**Catherine**:
We know when we look at the two extraordinary sittings we've had is when a deal has been reached, it's an 11th hour thing. We're going to see people engaged in this issue people biting their nails. There is something of a face-offbetween his party and the conservative party. They do have a deal with the bloc quÉbÉcois and they are close to a deal with the n. D.p. They are really at odds with theconservatives. Now let's throw another element into this, elizabeth may, the green party, was tweeting if there was some sort of agreementthat would require, as she put it, frequent return to the houseof commons, she wouldn't give unanimous consent to that or letthat happen because she thinks it is a public health issue. She was engaging with candace bergen who said she essentially agrees everyone having to come back on monday would be irresponsible, not a good idea. It was implicit and not explicit, she was putting the responsibility on the liberals. We need a deal to make this happen. She said parliament isn't ready for a virtual parliament. That's something we hear from andrew scheer time and time again. They have asked the speaker to look into this process, but it would take some time. There are some technical difficulties that make accountability challenging. At the same time the public health concern is a big one. Candace bergen -- you heard the Prime Minister saying some parties want four or five days aweek. Candace bergen tweeting what they would like is thee days a week, 90-minute sessions, with alimited number of m. P.s. I think that's important to flagthat nobody wants a situation where all 338 m. P.s are back. She asks why that would be too much. I think we heard some of that answer from the Prime Minister, as he suggested it is too much of a health risk. So the negotiations continue behind the scenes. Not sure whether the comments bythe Prime Minister are going to move the discussion along. I think we'll have to keep watching our e-mail.

**Rosemary**:
I think you're right. The other by the of big news, this concerns everyone, the canada-u. S. border.

**Catherine**:
A lot of canadiansmay say, status quo, this is just another 30-day extension. But it's interesting to watch what has been happening day in and day out with the questions by the media. Repeatedly reporters ask him to acknowledge what is in many waysi think obvious to a lot of canadians, particularly if you look at new york state right you, they say, sir, is it not apparent that the united states poses an enormous risk to us?and the Prime Minister does not want to acknowledge that, however self-evident that may be. I don't want to speculate on what's going on in the Prime Minister's mind, but there is a question whether he will provokethe united states. We have seen the government lurching around during the course of this outbreak as they're dealing with unexpected news from the united states. First there was a report of the united states putting troops on the border. Then there was donald trump possibly preventing 3m from sending the much-needed n95 masks to canada. I think it was interesting towards the end of the conversation, rosemary, the Prime Minister said something tothe effect of the deal with the united states that it would be many more weeks. This deal extends for another 30days. It's not clear if he was suggesting an extension beyond that as well, whether that is something they will be seeking. So much changes in the course ofthe day. Who knows where we will be in 30days. The liberals have pushed that issue back for another 30 days.

**Rosemary**:
Catharine, that's great. We'll come back to you. You'll be on standby. The Prime Minister spoke of the requirement to wear a mask when you're getting on a plane. The Prime Minister making it clear that you shouldn't be travelling, that non-essential travel shouldn't be happen, but if you are required for some reason to get on a plane, you are required to wear a mask. The other substance of the announcement was the decision toallow $306 million in loans and some non-refundable payments to indigenous small- and medium-sized businesses. This is another sector obviouslythat's been hard hit by covid-19. We saw the government try to getmoney to particular sectors yesterday. A bit of a continuation of that today. If i'm not mistaken, there's something like 6,000 indigenous businesses across the country. Tabatha bull joins me from toronto.

**Interview**:
Thanks for having me.

**Rosemary**:
How needed was thisgoing to be?was there a real desire for additional money for specifically indigenous businesses?

**Interview**:
Absolutely. There are actually over 50,000 indigenous businesses across thecountry, and 95% of those are small- and medium-sized businesses. In march we sent a letter to thePrime Minister and the covid cabinet along with a number of our friends including the national aboriginal capital commission, which the Prime Minister mentioned today. We wanted to ensure there was a way that small- and medium-sizedenterprises could access the liquidity and capital that was going out through the community emergency business account. This is a much-needed and welcome announcement.

**Rosemary**:
This is because a lot of indigenous companies use indigenous institutions, bankinginstitutions, primarily. So this will go directly to those, instead of to a traditional bank, as you say?

**Interview**:
That's right. A number of indigenous businesses are also -- about 65%of them are financed through their own personal savings or loans. They're not an existing client and ceba is for existing clients. So we needed another route to access the capital and liquidity.

**Rosemary**:
Another thing that struck me from what the Prime Minister said, and this is something we're seeing through various sectors, is that many ofthese businesses are owned and employ indigenous women. Can you give us a picture of that and how important it is. I know it's hit a lot of sectorsin the service industry. Give us a picture of that in terms of indigenous businesses.

**Interview**:
So we definitely see women more -- double the amount of women are innovating and coming into the indigenous entrepreneur. A lot of that helps for them to have a flexible schedule, not unlike women across the country. A lot of the sectors hit initially were sectors where youwould have a personal interaction, such as tourism. Those are sectors where we see higher women-owned businesses. We've seen a higher impact on indigenous women.

**Rosemary**:
Are there other things needed?the Prime Minister said this is the first step. These policy decisions being pushed out the door quickly are sometimes not the final version. Is there anything else you're looking for?

**Interview**:
Definitely. We've been working closely with the government on a number of the programs that have already been established. I don't think it's intentional, but I think there's a number of factors in those programs that excludes indigenous businesses. The wage subsidy is an example, aboriginal economic development corporations, who are a limited partnership with their community, but employ up to 800 indigenous people and a number of those organizations are currently excluded from the wagesubsidy just by the way their limited partnership is set up. So we're working closely with the government to try to understand that. Some of those businesses have laid off over half of their employees, and those are businesses that put back programming into the community. We need to make sure they can access that wage subsidy. Additionally procurement, we have a number of indigenous business members who are able tosupply p. P.e. And able to pivot to ensure we can all fight covid-19 together. I would like to see some type ofincentives that we can ensure that those indigenous businesseshave an opportunity to be part of the fight against covid-19, particularly when they can support loss of life in indigenous communities that are at a higher risk of this pandemic.

**Rosemary**:
You're talking about companies switching their supply chains to create things like masks?

**Interview**:
Definitely. We have seen a couple of our indigenous members who have pivoted to ethanol and producinghand sanitizer and a number of businesses too who have been able to access masks. Another great business abroflex has been able to pivot to makinggowns. We want to make sure those businesses have an opportunity to be part of the the federal supply chain and also to providesupport to communities.

**Rosemary**:
Tabatha, thanks formaking time for us.

**Interview**:
Thanks so much.

**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister's substantial announcement of aid today, $306 million of loans or non-repayable funds to go to indigenous businesses, of which there are many across the country.

> I WANT TO GO TO QUÉBEC, TO GET A PICTURE OF HOW THINGS ARE UNFOLDING IN THAT PROVINCE, ONE OF THE HARDEST-HIT PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY.NOT ONLY IN LONG-TERM CARE HOMES, BUT ACROSS THE PROVINCE.WE HAVE SEEN THE OUTBREAKS IN THE CENTRES HARD HIT IN THAT PROVINCE AS WELL AS ONTARIO.LET'S GO TO THE CBC'S MATT DEMUR.I DO KNOW THE PREMIER WAS ASKED YESTERDAY AND HE HAD SOME FRANK COMMENTS ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT AND THE EVALUATION OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT DEALING WITH IT.

**Reporter**:
Really what we heard yesterday from quÉbec's premier, franÇois legault, was amea culpa, about how the government of quÉbec has handledthe situation of long-term care facilities during the covid-19 pandemic, so much so that the government actually asked for assistance from the federal government to get canadian armedforces members to come into the province and help out in some ofthese facilities. That's going to start today. There are going to be 125 armed forces members deployed in quÉbec to help in these facilities. We heard from the canadian armedforces that that is starting at a specific long-term care facility in montreal. In fact, by noon people should be in that facility. We're talking about nursing officers, technicians, and othersupport staff who are going to be going in there to try to helpout. Premier legault essentially saidthere is a deteriorating situation in these long-term care facilities. In fact, more than half of the deaths reported in quÉbec attributable to covid-19 have happened in these long-term carefacilities. Now, the premier said that his government should have tackled the situation in these long-termcare facilities sooner, especially the issue of chronic under staffing. He said before this pandemic thegovernment should have acted quicker on trying to get higher salaries in these places --

**Rosemary**:
Matt, i'm sorry, i've got to let you go because i'm going to end the special on the main network. You can watch us on cbc news network.[♪♪♪] [ please stand by ]

**Rosemary**:
The city oftoronto today is holding sometalks about laying out apotential timeline for itsreopening, even though it isstill many week away fromallowing that to happen. This is all in the planningstages. The Prime Minister, of course,has said that it will be weeks,still, before canadians will beable to go back to some sort ofsense of normal life, even ifthat includes going to the park,for instance. Covid-19 continues to killcanadians everyday, particularlyas we know in Ontario andQuebec's long-term care homes,about half of the deaths in thiscountry attributed to what ishappening in those places. The severe outbreaks and theinability to contain or movepeople from long-term carecentres. As we wait for this briefing toget started, i'll bring incatherine cullen.

**Operator**:
The first questionis from radio-canada.

**Question**:
Hello, I have aquestion for minister duclos. Minister, we have extended theborder measures with the unitedstates. Have we obtained any guaranteesthat we will be able to receiveessential medical supplies fromthe united states without anyhiccups at the border or withoutany issues with the trumpadministration?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. Thank you for the question. As you have mentioned., ourrelationship with the unitedstates is very important in thiscontext and all contexts. In the current situation, ouru. S.-canada relations are veryimportant. We have conversations with ourpartners every single day. The border agreement that wereached a few weeks ago has beenextended for another 30 days. And we need to ensure thecontinued flow of essentialsupplies, food, medicines. Have we received a guarantee tothat effect?

YES, AND WE ARECONFIDENT IN EXTENDING THIS DEALFOR ANOTHER 30 DAYS.AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVEDISCUSSIONS ABOUT OTHER TOPICSWITH A VIEW OF FLOWING SUPPLIESACROSS THE BORDER IN BOTHDIRECTIONS.OUR CANADA-U.S. RELATIONS AREVERY IMPORTANT AND ARE VERYPOSITIVE AND WE WORK VERY HARDTO MAINTAIN A GOOD, STRONGRELATIONSHIP.I WAS SAYING WHAT MOST CANADIANSUNDERSTAND IS THAT THERELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FRIEND ANDNEIGHBOUR IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANTIN ALL ASPECTS BUT ABSOLUTELYESSENTIAL IN THE CURRENTEMERGENCY CONTEXT.WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE FACTTHAT WE WERE ABLE TO RENEGOTIATETHE AGREEMENT THAT WE HADACHIEVED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGOFOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS, WHICHACHIEVES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTOBJECTIVES, BUT ONE IS THEABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO KEEP THEMOVEMENT OF ESSENTIAL GOODS ANDSERVICES ACROSS THE FRONTEIRS INBOTH WAY.BECAUSE GOODS GO SOUTH, NORTHAND THOSE GOODS, MEDICAL, FOODAND OTHER THINGS ARE FOREIGNMAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND HEALTHOF CANADIANS.

**Question**:
I have a veryspecific question about personalprotective equipment at theborder. Have you received a guaranteesfrom the american governmentthat 3m and other americancompanies will be able to exportmedical supplies and protectiveequipment to canada?will we be able to import thesesupplies from americancompanies?have you received a guaranteefrom that effect from theamerican government?will we be able to receivemedical supplies and especiallypersonal protective equipment?

**Answer**:
Minister duclous. S.the word word is vigilant. These past few weeks, we haveobserved that essential goodsincluding medicine have beenable to flow across the bordervery well, but the motto isvigilance. Yes, we have a very goodrelationship with the americangovernment, but thisrelationship will continue to beput to the test over the nextfew weeks. We will remain vigilant toensure that our canada-u. S.relationship, which is currentlyvery strong, we will ensure thatit continues to remain strong inthe next few weeks. The essential discussion inaction that we have around thetransit of medical goods and ithink we first must admit thatthings are going quite well withefforts on both sides of thefrontier, meaning we havemedical goods in both directionsin the current crisis. This being said, we need to bevigilant because thatrelationship is going to betested for the rest of thecrisis. We have citizens on both sidesof the border that are anxious,that are in need of beingreassured and that's exactlywhat the responsibility of thefellow government is, is to notonly to provide the essentialflow of those medical goods butalso to reassure canadians thatwe will always be working in therelationship and movement ofthose goods.

THANK YOU, MINISTER.NEXT QUESTION.

**Question**:
Our next question.

---

**Question**:
Mellow. I have questionsfor minister duclos. For a question about militarymedics being sent into long-termcare facilities in Quebec as oftoday. The government hasn't given usmuch detail about where theywill go. They mentioned the st region. Could you tell us where thesemilitary medics are sent todayand how many are sent and towhich regions?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. Thank you for your question. I would like to thank actors inboth governments who have workedhard to make this happen very,very quickly. We all recognise the urgency ofthe situation the government ofQuebec has a primaryresponsibility to handle thesituation, but the federalgovernment is also responsiblefor quickly stepping in to helpafter receiving the request thatwe received. 125 medically trained forceswill be deployed in Quebec. The government of Quebec willmanage their deployment. The government of Quebec willidentify it's needs, where theneeds are on the ground and thegovernment of Quebec will decidewhat responsibilities thesearmed force's members will have. We've heard it is satisfied withhow quickly we have stepped into make this happen. These individuals will be sentto facilities where needs arepressing. The government of Quebec issatisfied and that said, thefederal government must continueto help in any way that it can,given the importance and urgencyof the situation.

**Operator**:
Now a followupquestion.

---

**Question**:
I'm getting theimpression you don't know wherethe needs are dire and maybe youcan answer on minister freeland. There was a minister's call withthe provisional and territorialpremiers and remuneration ofessential workers was discussed. Had a deal been reached withprovinces regarding salarypop-ups for essential workexperts what decisions have beentaken and which workers willreceive these top-ups.

**Answer**:
We are starting torealize in Quebec and everywherein canada that many essentialworkers are not sufficientlyremixer n e. R.a. T derick. Remunerated. Another element you mentioned isthat the government of Quebecwants to help provinces andterritories and everyone wantsto help essential workers. As minister freeland said, thesetalks are going well. Everyone is on the same wavelength. Now it's a matter of finding theright ways to act, the rightways for the federal governmentto provide financial support andsalary pop-ups. There are jurisdictional issuesand the government of canada, ofcourse, wants to providesupport, but must do so in sucha way that they protect thejurisdictions.

---

**Question**:
B. C.'s success iscredited with good tracing andOntario seems to be laggingbehind. Will the federal government stepin and mandate provinces toincrease testing and are youconcerned that provinces thatare lagging behind will pulldown those that have come ahead?

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT INDESCRIBING TESTING AND TRACINGAS BEING KEY AND ACTIONS IN THECOVID-19 PROCESS.WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THATDIFFERENT PROVINCES FACEDIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.AND IN QUEBEC AND THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS NOT ONLYWILLING BUT MOST OFTEN ALWAYSABLE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THATMAY BE HELPFUL IN THE LOCALCIRCUMSTANCES AND PROVIDE ANYLOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND ANYPROCUREMENT SUPPORT WHEN ITCOMES TO MAKING EQUIPMENT ANDTESTING EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TOPROVINCES AND TERRITORIES.SO WE WANT TO DO THIS AS MUCH ASIS NEEDED AND THAT'S WHAT WEWILL CONTINUE TO DO.

---

**Question**:
With regard tothose that are on old-agesecurity or disability benefits,those that have a fixed income,what's being done for thosepeople who might be facingmounting costs with regard togroceries or transportation orcost of living on a fixed incomeand is there any talk with theprovinces about making sure thatcerb doesn't affect theirreceiving federal benefits?

WELL, THAT'S MAKING ENDS NEATMEETIS A LARGE SOURCE OF ANXIETDPARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME ANDTHAT'S WHY WE ACTED VERY QUICKLYPUTTING INTO PLACE MEASURES THATTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CERTAINLYNEVER IMPLEMENTED AND PROBABLYNEVER ENVISIONED, SUCH AS THECANADA EMERGENCY RESPONSEBENEFIT, BUT ALSO INCREASING THEGST TAX CREDIT, PROVIDINGSUPPORT TO FAMILIES WITHCHILDREN AND IN PARTICULAR,FAMILIES WITH LOWER NEXTSTHROUGH THE CHILD CANADABENEFIT.AS THE PRIME MINISTER KEEPSSAYING, WE ARE WORKING IN ANEMERGENCY SITUATION WHICHREQUIRES CONTINUING ACTIONS ANDCONTINUING FORMS OF SUPPORT.SO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ASTHE PRIME MINISTER AGAIN SAID,CONTINUE BEING MINDFUL OF THEANXIETY AND THE DIFFICULTCIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THECANADIANS ARE GOING THROUGH, BUTALSO RENEWING AND DEVELOPING OURCONTINUING SUPPORT TO THOSECANADIANS.

**Question**:
My question is forminister duclos. You spoke about how thecanada-u. S. relationship will betested in the upcoming weeks. When trump expresses impatienceand a strong desire to reopenthe american economy, does thatworry you?

**Answer**:
As an economist,given the current circumstances,if we want to reopen theeconomy, then we must be very,very cautious, especially whenit comes to public health. We have made major sacrificesthese past few weeks. We have been isolated and wehave felt anxious and we havealso made economic sacrifices. People have lost their jobs. People are having difficultymaking ends meet. So we always have to weighpublic health outcomes andeconomic outcomes..in the next few weeks andmonths, we will have to be very,very cautious. Of course, many of us areanxious to reopen the economy. That said, we must absolutelyfollow the recommendations ofour public health experts. We must take the necessarypublic health measures if wewant to reopen the economy. Followup question.

---

**Question**:
All right. So that was your economist'spoint of view. Now what's your point of view asa canadian, as a canadiancitizen?president trump wants peoplemoving around freely as soon aspossible. How do you feel about that?could that compromise publichealth and safety in canada?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. No, i'm not worried. Our public health experts arevery trustworthy and moreover,our municipalities, provincesand territories are doing suchan excellent job when it comesto public health and spreadingpublic health messages. I think we can be very proud tobe canadian right now. Our healthcare system is robustand at some point, we willreopen the economy. The federal government has avery solid financial position,so we will be able to roar backat some point and when we wantto roar back, it will beessential that all levels ofgovernment cooperate and worktogether all while respectingpublic health measures. So when we're ready to roarback, all levels of governmentwill work together and we willreopen the economy. Thank you, minister. That concludes today's pressconference.

**Rosemary**:
The federalcabinet minister's briefing andpublic health official'spreving. Briefing. Let me give you some informationin the canada relief benefit,the cerb that many of you havetapped into because you havelost work or lost your jobs dueto covid-19 and he says therehave been 7. 9 millionapplications. Just to give you a sense of howmuch the economy is strugglingand how many of you are, too,are turning to the governmentfor support. Catherine cullen has beenlistening along with us and i'mnot sure if anything else stoodout for you. We did get new numbers on covidoutbreaks in differentindigenous communities.

**Reporter**:
Let's talk aboutwhat minister duclos said whenhe was asked about theprotective equipment across thecanada-u. S. border. I thought it was interesting hesaid they'll have to remainvigilant on this particularissue and did note while thecanada-u. S. relationship is agood one, it's one that has beentested and he said it wouldcontinue to be tested over thecourse of the next few weeks,and that goes back to the pointwe were talking about beforethis news conference started. That the government officials donot want to politician italy sata great source this is, as wesee the picture across theproblems and territories and thepicture seems to change fromstate to state, too, and a lotof attention being paid to newyork city state. The government does not want tosay it's a significant concernbut obviously, this 30-day 30-dyextension on the border is arelief to government trying todeal with a large number ofother issue. We heard recurring conversation,once again, with the Prime Minister today, withjean duclos, as well, whencanada can talk aboutrestartingthe economy. It is very clear this is asituation that will change fromregion to region and everyone issaying the watch word is cautionand this needs to be donecautiously and carefully. There's incredible concern abouteasing things too quickly andseeing a major resurgence andeveryone is looking at expectssouth of the border but morebroadly international and ithink singapore comes to mind,where they're trying to restartthe economy and restart society,but concerned that one falsemove could lead to a majoroutbreak. I would note something we'vebeen talking about over thecourse of the programme which isthe situation in long-term carehomes. While they may be in some waysisolated from society morebroadly, they're obviously amajor source of concern rightnow. It's a significant contribution,i guess, we can say, to thenumber of deaths we're seeing incanada right now.

**Rosemary**:
Probably it willlook not only different regionto region, but probably it willlook different in terms ofsociety. Vulnerable people, seniors,older canadians will probably beliving under differentrestrictions than other peoplefor some time because they arethe ones most susceptible. So you can see a ramping down ofmeasures and maybe parks willopen to kick around a soccerball. But restaurants only open at 50%capacity. We are seeing some of thathappening in other parts of theworld and so that gives us someindications of what that mightlook like. Dr. Tam was not there today butmr. Duclos say they remaincautiously optimistic about whatthey are seeing. But again, I think everyone issaying we can't let go nowbecause then everything thatwe've done for past four or fiveweeks will be lost, potentially.

**Reporter**:
That raises acouple of points. One about testing and if I couldecho dr. Tam for a minute and weknow, perhaps, what she mightsay, something we've heardrepeatedly is this question ofthe curve. Yes, perhaps, you've reached thepeak but that's only 50% of thecases and you have to be certainwe've heard her say time andtime again, be mindful of whathappens on the way back down,because that is 50% of thecases. Again, the need for ongoingvigilance. We would talk about testing, aswell, a question ashley burkeraised when speaking to thePrime Minister and she pointedto research out of harvarduniversity which suggests forthe united states to sort ofopen things back up, they needto be doing something in theneighborhood of half a milliontests or upwards of that. Ashley asked the Prime Ministerwhether there was a specificnumber he had been advised offor canada in terms of the levelof testing needed and he did notcertainly come close to engagingin specific numbers, but did saythat, too, is uneven across thecountry. Where there are somesomejurisdictions doing well, hschoosing words carefully, sayingthere are other jurisdictionstrying to improve their efforts. That is one piece of the puzzle. You talk about kicking aroundthe soccer ball and that's anice mental image for us rightnow, but obviously, there aredecisions, too, about what thepicture looks like. I thought when you were speakingabout what's happening -- thediscussion, I should say ofwhat's happening in california,the governor talking about theprospect of ok, perhaps we wouldreopen restaurants, but menuswould be disposable and all ofthe precautions taken. You can imagine that just onefalse move would cause everybodyto snap back, as well. So it's really a very dynamicconversation, but one that ithink people are hungry foranswers to, as well.

**Rosemary**:

WE ARE THE LEGENDS.

THE LEGENDS, OK.AND IT GOT SHUT DOWN, OBVIOUSLY,BECAUSE NO ONE IS ABLE TO DOANYTHING AND WHAT DID YOU GUYSDECIDE TO DO?

WELL, IT WAS A UNANIMOUSDECISION, WE GOT SHUT DOWNBECAUSE OF COVID-19 ON MARCH13th, FRIDAY THE 13th AND NOMORE HOCKEY.BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY LEFTAND A REFUND OF $4,200.SO OUR CHIEF ORGANIZER, WHOTHOUGHT HE'S GOING TO GET A TAXDONATION BACK, A REFUND BACK, HETOPPED IT OFF TO MAKE THE $7,000IN THE KITTY.WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BLOW OUR OWNHORNS BUT SHOW OTHER HOCKEYTEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHATTHEY CAN DO.SO $7,000 HAS GONE TO THE OTTAWAFOOD BANK AND THE OTTAWA MISSIONHELPING THOSE WHO LIVE ONSTREETS AND NEED A SAFE BED.SO $7,000, WE LIKE TO LOOK ATTHIS AS AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT,NOT A GRASS ROOT'S MOVEMENT, BUTAN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT, AND WEARE ENCOURAGING OTHER TEAMSACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLEINVOLVED IN FIGURE SKATING CLUBSTO DONATE MONEY TO THEIRCHARITY, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ACREDIT FOR NEXT YEAR.IT'S NOT MUCH MONEY, BUT ATLEAST IT DOES SOMETHING AND ITSHOWS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWMORE WINGS AND TOO MANY BEERS,THAT WE CAN GIVE BACK TO OURCOMMUNITY.[ Laughter ]

IT'S A SMART IDEA BECAUSE,OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS THE FIRSTWAVE OF SOME SPORTS BEING SHUTDOWN, BUT I'M NOT SURE SOCCERAND OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BESTARTING UP QUICKLY ANY TIMESOON AND THERE MAY BE OTHERPLACES WHERE THAT WILL WORK,TOO.

WELL, OF COURSE, IT WILL.THERE ARE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEUSED LIKE THE RUSTY BLADES ANDTHAT WAS TAKEN.SO A LOT OF US FEEL WE'RELEGENDS IN OUR OWN MINDS AND OUR#HOCKEYLEGENDS HELPED.THIS IS $7,000 AND THIS COULDGROW TO $70,000, $700,000 ACROSSTHE COUNTRY AND, PERHAPS, EVENTHOSE SOCCER TEAMS YOU TALKEDABOUT, THEY MAY HAVE MONEY LINEDUP TO START PRACTICING AND STARTPLAYING.WELL, THEY CAN'T RIGHT NOW, BUTEVEN THAT MONEY, A BIT OF THATMONEY COULD GO A LONG WAY AND ANINDIVIDUAL FIGURE SKATER ORINDIVIDUAL HOCKEY PLAYER COULDUSE THE REFUND TO HELP A CHARITYOF HIS OR HER CHOICE.

IT'S A GOOD IDEA.SENATOR, I'LL ASK YOU THE OTHERPART OF YOUR JOB QUESTION, IFTHAT'S OK.YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE,LOSING TRACK OF TIME, THE SENATEDECIDED IT WOULD SUSPEND SITTINGUNTIL, I THINK, THE BEGINNING OFJUNE.AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE OFCOMMONS IS GRAPPLING WITH THATRIGHT NOW AND THEY HAVE YET TOREACH AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN ON MONDAY.WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

MY THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THATWE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.OUR COMMITTEES CAN MEETVIRTUALLY AND WE CAN PASSLEGISLATION IF LEGISLATION COMESTO US, BUT WE THINK IT'SEXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO LIVE ANDWORK BY EXAMPLE AND WORK FROMHOME AND THERE'S NO PLACE -- WESHOULD NOT BE SITTING IN THESENATE OF CANADA.CANADIANS HAVE BEEN ASKED TOSTAY AT HOME.WE CAN ALSO WORK FROM HOME ANDGET OUR JOBS DONE, WHETHER IT'SADVOCACY OR LEGISLATION.SO WE HAVE POSTPONED UNTILJUNE 2nd.DOESN'T MEAN OUR WORK IS NOTDONE, BUT I THINK THAT TRAVELINGACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIMEIS NOT A SMART THING TO DO.WHAT ARE WE DOING?WE'RE STAYING HOME, WORKING ANDENJOYING OUR FAMILIES AND WE'REGIVING BACK AND AS POLITICIANS,I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY,VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOUS.

YOU PROBABLY WERE IN THESENATE, THOUGH, OVER THE PASTCOUPLE OF WEEKS TO HELP WITH THELEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE INTHE REGION.AND DID IT WORK?WERE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ALIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE?

WE HAD 26 SENATORS THERE ANDEVERYBODY SPOKE ON THE PIECESLEGISLATION THAT WAS BEFORE US.AND THERE WAS PHYSICALDISTANCING, SIX FEET.IT WORKED AND IT CAN WORK AGAIN,BUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE WORKINGON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHENPIECES OF LEGISLATION COME TO USIN THAT WAY.I MEAN, THE THOUGHT OF HAVING AVIRTUAL PARLIAMENT, IT CAN WORK,BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WORK TO BEDONE.IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE CREATEDIN OUR SENATE A SOCIAL AFFAIR'SCOMMITTEE AND FINANCE COMMITTEETO MEET AND HEAR WITNESSES, TOTAKE ACCOUNT TO WHAT THEGOVERNMENT IS DOING OR NOT DOINGAND HOW SOCIETY IS COPING.SO WE CAN STILL SOUND AS ASECOND THOUGHT AND LISTENING TOCANADIAN'S CONCERNS.

SENATOR, GOOD TO TALK TO YOUABOUT POLITICS AND BEER LEAGUEHOCKEY AND YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TOPEOPLE.

DON'T FORGET TO GIVE, YOUKNOW.STAY ON THE ICE, BUT DO ITTHROUGH MONEY.IT'S AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT.

THANK YOU, SENATOR.GOOD TO SEE YOU,S ALWAYS, STAYHEALTHY,.
