That is the Prime Minister of Canada on this Saturday morning, briefing Canadians on his government's actions to fight  Let's bring in the cbc's Catharine   I'll pick up where the Prime Minister left off. It is of interest in  bu tit should be of interest to everyone. If no agreement is reached, 338 people have to get back here  for parliament to sit.

**Catherine**:
We know when we look at the two extraordinary sittings we've had is when a deal has been reached, it's an  hour thing. We're going to see people engaged in this issue people biting their nails. There is something of a face-offbetween  party and the conservative party. They do have a deal with the bloc quÉbÉcois and they are close to a deal with the NDP  are really at odds with theconservatives.  let's throw another element into this, elizabeth  the green party, was tweeting if there was some sort of agreementthat  require, as she put it, frequent return to the houseof  she wouldn't give unanimous consent to that or letthat  because she thinks it is a public health issue. She was engaging with candace   said she essentially agrees everyone having to come back on monday  be irresponsible, not a good idea. It was implicit and not explicit, she was putting the responsibility on the liberals. We need a deal to make this happen. She said parliament isn't ready for a virtual parliament. That's something we hear from andrew   and time again. They have asked the speaker to look into this process, but it would take some time. There are some technical difficulties that make accountability challenging. At the same time the public health concern is a big one. Candace bergen --  heard the Prime Minister saying some parties want four or five days a week. Candace bergen  what they would like is thee days a week, 90-minute sessions, with alimited  of MPs.  think that's important to flagthat  wants a situation where all 338 MPs  back. She asks why that would be too much. I think we heard some of that answer from the Prime Minister, as he suggested it is too much of a health risk. So the negotiations continue behind the scenes. Not sure whether the comments by the Prime Minister are going to move the discussion along. I think we'll have to keep watching our e-mail.

**Rosemary**:
I think you're right. The other by the of big news, this concerns everyone, the Canada-US border.

**Catherine**:
a lot of  say, status quo, this is just another 30-day extension. But it's interesting to watch what has been happening day in and day out with the questions by the media. Repeatedly reporters ask him to acknowledge what is in many ways think obvious to a lot of Canadians, particularly if you look at new York state right you, they say, sir, is it not apparent that the United States poses an enormous risk to us?and the Prime Minister does not want to acknowledge that, however self-evident that may be. I don't want to speculate on what's going on in the Prime Minister's mind, but there is a question whether he will provokethe United  We have seen the government lurching around during the course of this outbreak as they're dealing with unexpected news from the United States. First there was a report of the United States putting troops on the border. Then there was donald trump  preventing 3m from sending the much-needed n95 masks to Canada. I think it was interesting towards the end of the conversation, rosemary, the Prime Minister said something to the effect of the deal with the United States that it would be many more weeks. This deal extends for another 30days. It's not clear if he was suggesting an extension beyond that as well, whether that is something they will be seeking. So much changes in the course ofthe day. Who  where we will be in 30days. The liberals have pushed that issue back for another 30 days.

**Rosemary**:
 that's great. We'll come back to you. You'll be on standby. The Prime Minister spoke of the requirement to wear a mask when you're getting on a plane. The Prime Minister making it clear that you shouldn't be travelling, that non-essential travel shouldn't be happen, but if you are required for some reason to get on a plane, you are required to wear a mask. The other substance of the announcement was the decision toallow $306  in loans and some non-refundable payments to indigenous small- and medium-sized businesses. This is another sector obviouslythat's been hard hit by COVID-19. We saw  government try to getmoney to particular  yesterday. a bit of a continuation of that today. If I'm not mistaken, there's something like 6. 000 indigenous businesses across the country. Tabatha bull joins me from toronto.

**Interview**:
Thanks for having me.

**Rosemary**:
How needed was this going to be?was there a real desire for additional money for specifically indigenous businesses?

**Interview**:
Absolutely. There are actually over 50. 000 indigenous businesses across  and 95% of those are small- and medium-sized businesses. In march we sent a letter to theprime Minister and the COVID-19  along with a number of our friends including the national aboriginal capital commission, which the Prime Minister mentioned today. We wanted to ensure there was a way that small- and medium-sizedenterprises could  the liquidity and capital that was going out through the community emergency business account. This is a much-needed and welcome announcement.

**Rosemary**:
This is because a lot of indigenous companies use indigenous institutions,  primarily. So this will go directly to those, instead of to a traditional bank, as you say?

**Interview**:
That's right. a number of indigenous businesses are also -- about 65%of them are financed through their own personal savings or loans. They're not an existing client and Reba is for existing clients. So we needed another route to access the capital and liquidity.

**Rosemary**:
Another thing that struck me from what the Prime Minister said, and this is something we're seeing through various sectors, is that many of these businesses are owned and employ indigenous women. Can you give us a picture of that and how important it is. I know it's hit a lot of sectors in the service industry. Give us a picture of that in terms of indigenous businesses.

**Interview**:
So we definitely see women more -- double the amount of women are innovating and coming into the indigenous entrepreneur. a lot of that helps for them to have a flexible schedule, not unlike women across the country. a lot of the sectors hit initially were sectors where you would have a personal interaction, such as tourism. Those are sectors where we see higher women-owned businesses. We've seen a higher impact on indigenous women.

**Rosemary**:
Are there other things needed?the Prime Minister said this is the first step. These policy decisions being pushed out the door quickly are sometimes not the final version. is there anything else you're looking for?

**Interview**:
Definitely. We've been working closely with the government on a number of the programs that have already been established. I don't think it's intentional, but I think there's a number of factors in those programs that excludes indigenous businesses. The wage subsidy is an example, aboriginal economic development corporations, who are a limited partnership with their community, but employ up to 800 indigenous people and a number of those organizations are currently excluded from the wage subsidy just by the way their limited partnership is set up. So we're working closely with the government to try to understand that. Some of those businesses have laid off over half of their employees, and those are businesses that put back programming into the community. We need to make sure they can access that wage subsidy. Additionally procurement, we have a number of indigenous business members who are able to supply POE and able to pivot to ensure we can all fight COVID-19 together. I would like to see some type of incentives that we can ensure that those indigenous businesses have an opportunity to be part of the fight against  particularly when they can support loss of life in indigenous communities that are at a higher risk of this pandemic.

**Rosemary**:
You're talking about companies switching their supply chains to create things like masks?

**Interview**:
Definitely. We have seen a couple of our indigenous members who have pivoted to ethanol and producing hand sanitize and a number of businesses too who have been able to access masks. Another great business  has been able to pivot to  We want to make sure those businesses have an opportunity to be part of the the federal supply chain and also to provide support to communities.

**Rosemary**:
Tabatha, thanks for making time for us.

**Interview**:
Thanks so much.

**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister's substantial announcement of aid today, $306 million of loans or non-repayable funds to go to indigenous businesses, of which there are many across the country.

**Answer**:
Minister  Os. Thank you for your question. I would like to thank actors in both governments who have worked hard to make this happen very. Very quickly. We all recognise the urgency of the situation the government  has a primary responsibility to handle  but the federal government is also responsible for quickly stepping in to help after receiving the request that we received. 125 medically trained force swill be deployed in Quebec. The government of Quebec will manage their deployment. The government of Quebec will identify it's needs, where the needs are on the ground and the government of Quebec will decide what responsibilities these armed force's members will have. We've heard it is satisfied with how quickly we have stepped into make this happen.

Another element you mentioned is that the government of  to help provinces and territories and everyone wants to help essential workers. As Minister Freeland said, these talks are going well. Everyone is on the same wavelength. Now it's a matter of finding the right ways to act, the right ways for the federal government to provide financial support and salary pop-ups. There are jurisdictional issuesand  government of Canada, ofcourse,  to providesupport,  must do so in sucha  that they protect thejurisdictions.

Thank you. Our next question, please

**Question**:
My question is for minister  You spoke about how  relationship will betested  the upcoming weeks. When trump expresses impatienceand a strong desire to reopenthe   does thatworry 

**Answer**:
As an economist. Given the current circumstances. If we want to reopen  then we must be very. Very cautious, especially when it comes to public health. We have made major sacrifices these past few weeks. We have been isolated and we have felt anxious and we have also made economic sacrifices. People have lost their jobs. People are having difficulty making ends meet. So we always have to weigh public health outcomes and economic outcomes..in the next few weeks andmonths,  will have to be very. Very cautious. Of course, many of us areanxious  reopen the economy. That said, we must absolutelyfollow  recommendations of our public health experts. We must take the necessarypublic  measures if wewant  reopen the economy. Followup question.

---

**Question**:
All right. So that was your economist'spoint of view. Now what's your point of view as a  as a  trump wants peoplemoving  freely as soon aspossible.  do you feel about that?could that compromise publichealth and  in Canada?

**Answer**:
Minister  Os. No, I'm not worried. Our public health experts are very trustworthy and moreover. Our municipalities, province sand territories are doing such an excellent job when it comes to public health and spreading public health messages. I think we can be very proud to be Canadian right now. Our healthcare system is robust and at some point, we will reopen the economy. The federal government has Avery solid financial position. So we will be able to roar back at some point and when we want to roar back, it will be essential that all levels of government cooperate and work together all while respecting public health measures. So when we're ready to  all levels of government will work together and we will reopen the economy. Thank you, Minister. That concludes today's

The federal cabinet Minister's briefing and public health official'spreving. Briefing. Let me give you some information in the Canada relief benefit. The CERB that many of you have tapped into because you have lost work or lost your jobs due to COVID-19 and he says there have been 7. 9  Just to give you a sense of how much the economy is struggling and how many of you are, too. Are turning to the government for support. Catherine Cullen has been listening along with us and I'mnot sure if anything else stood out for you. We did get new numbers on  in different indigenous communities.

Let's talk about what Minister  said when he was asked about the protective equipment across  border. I thought it was interesting hesaid  have to remainvigilant  this particularissue and did note while thecanada-US  is agood one,  one that has beentested and  said it wouldcontinue to  tested over thecourse of  next few weeks. and that goes back to the pointwe were  about beforethis news  started.

Once again, with the Prime Minister today, withjean duclos,   whencanada can  aboutrestartingthe economy. It is very clear this is asituation that  change fromregion to  and everyone issaying the  word is cautionand this  to be donecautiously and  There's incredible concern abouteasing things  quickly andseeing a  resurgence andeveryone is  at expectssouth of  border but morebroadly international and ithink singapore   mind.

**Rosemary**:
Probably it will look not only different region to region, but probably it will look different in terms  Vulnerable people, seniors. Older Canadians will probably be living under different restrictions than other people for some time because they are the ones most susceptible. So you can see a ramping down of measures and maybe parks will open to kick around a  But restaurants only open at 50%capacity. We are seeing some of that happening in other parts of the world and so that gives us some indications of what that might look like. Dr. Tam was not there today   say they remain cautiously optimistic about what they are seeing. But again, I think everyone is saying we can't let go now because then everything thatwe've done for past four or five weeks will be lost, potentially.

**Reporter**:
That raises couple of points. One about testing and if I could echo Dr. Tam for a minute and  perhaps, what she  something we've heard repeatedly is this question of the curve. Yes, perhaps, you've reached the peak but that's only 50% of the cases and you have to be certainwe've heard her say time and time again, be mindful of what happens on the way back down. Because that is 50% of  Again, the need for  We would talk about testing, as well, a question Ashley  when speaking to the prime Minister and she pointed to research out of  which suggests for the United States to sort of open things back up, they need to be doing something in the neighborhood of half a million tests or upwards of that.

That is one piece of the puzzle. You talk about kicking around the soccer ball and that's an ice mental image for us  but obviously, there  too, about what the picture looks like. I thought when you were speaking about what's happening --  I should say ofwhat's happening in  The governor talking about the prospect of  perhaps we would reopen restaurants, but menus would be disposable and all of the precautions taken. You can imagine that just one false move would cause everybody to snap back, as well. So it's really a very  but one that think people are hungry for answers to, as well.

THE LEGENDS, OK.AND IT GOT SHUT DOWN, OBVIOUSLY,BECAUSE NO ONE IS ABLE TO DOANYTHING AND WHAT DID YOU GUYSDECIDE TO DO?

WELL, IT WAS A UNANIMOUSDECISION, WE GOT SHUT DOWNBECAUSE OF COVID-19 ON MARCH13th, FRIDAY THE 13th AND NOMORE HOCKEY.BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY LEFTAND A REFUND OF $4,200.SO OUR CHIEF ORGANIZER, WHOTHOUGHT HE'S GOING TO GET A TAXDONATION BACK, A REFUND BACK, HETOPPED IT OFF TO MAKE THE $7,000IN THE KITTY.WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BLOW OUR OWNHORNS BUT SHOW OTHER HOCKEYTEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHATTHEY CAN DO.SO $7,000 HAS GONE TO THE OTTAWAFOOD BANK AND THE OTTAWA MISSIONHELPING THOSE WHO LIVE ONSTREETS AND NEED A SAFE BED.SO $7,000, WE LIKE TO LOOK ATTHIS AS AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT,NOT A GRASS ROOT'S MOVEMENT, BUTAN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT, AND WEARE ENCOURAGING OTHER TEAMSACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLEINVOLVED IN FIGURE SKATING CLUBSTO DONATE MONEY TO THEIRCHARITY, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ACREDIT FOR NEXT YEAR.IT'S NOT MUCH MONEY, BUT ATLEAST IT DOES SOMETHING AND ITSHOWS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWMORE WINGS AND TOO MANY BEERS,THAT WE CAN GIVE BACK TO OURCOMMUNITY.[ Laughter ]

IT'S A SMART IDEA BECAUSE,OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS THE FIRSTWAVE OF SOME SPORTS BEING SHUTDOWN, BUT I'M NOT SURE SOCCERAND OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BESTARTING UP QUICKLY ANY TIMESOON AND THERE MAY BE OTHERPLACES WHERE THAT WILL WORK,TOO.

WELL, OF COURSE, IT WILL.THERE ARE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEUSED LIKE THE RUSTY BLADES ANDTHAT WAS TAKEN.SO A LOT OF US FEEL WE'RELEGENDS IN OUR OWN MINDS AND OUR#HOCKEYLEGENDS HELPED.THIS IS $7,000 AND THIS COULDGROW TO $70,000, $700,000 ACROSSTHE COUNTRY AND, PERHAPS, EVENTHOSE SOCCER TEAMS YOU TALKEDABOUT, THEY MAY HAVE MONEY LINEDUP TO START PRACTICING AND STARTPLAYING.WELL, THEY CAN'T RIGHT NOW, BUTEVEN THAT MONEY, A BIT OF THATMONEY COULD GO A LONG WAY AND ANINDIVIDUAL FIGURE SKATER ORINDIVIDUAL HOCKEY PLAYER COULDUSE THE REFUND TO HELP A CHARITYOF HIS OR HER CHOICE.

IT'S A GOOD IDEA.SENATOR, I'LL ASK YOU THE OTHERPART OF YOUR JOB QUESTION, IFTHAT'S OK.YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE,LOSING TRACK OF TIME, THE SENATEDECIDED IT WOULD SUSPEND SITTINGUNTIL, I THINK, THE BEGINNING OFJUNE.AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE OFCOMMONS IS GRAPPLING WITH THATRIGHT NOW AND THEY HAVE YET TOREACH AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN ON MONDAY.WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

MY THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THATWE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.OUR COMMITTEES CAN MEETVIRTUALLY AND WE CAN PASSLEGISLATION IF LEGISLATION COMESTO US, BUT WE THINK IT'SEXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO LIVE ANDWORK BY EXAMPLE AND WORK FROMHOME AND THERE'S NO PLACE -- WESHOULD NOT BE SITTING IN THESENATE OF CANADA.CANADIANS HAVE BEEN ASKED TOSTAY AT HOME.WE CAN ALSO WORK FROM HOME ANDGET OUR JOBS DONE, WHETHER IT'SADVOCACY OR LEGISLATION.SO WE HAVE POSTPONED UNTILJUNE 2nd.DOESN'T MEAN OUR WORK IS NOTDONE, BUT I THINK THAT TRAVELINGACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIMEIS NOT A SMART THING TO DO.WHAT ARE WE DOING?WE'RE STAYING HOME, WORKING ANDENJOYING OUR FAMILIES AND WE'REGIVING BACK AND AS POLITICIANS,I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY,VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOUS.

YOU PROBABLY WERE IN THESENATE, THOUGH, OVER THE PASTCOUPLE OF WEEKS TO HELP WITH THELEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE INTHE REGION.AND DID IT WORK?WERE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ALIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE?

WE HAD 26 SENATORS THERE ANDEVERYBODY SPOKE ON THE PIECESLEGISLATION THAT WAS BEFORE US.AND THERE WAS PHYSICALDISTANCING, SIX FEET.IT WORKED AND IT CAN WORK AGAIN,BUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE WORKINGON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHENPIECES OF LEGISLATION COME TO USIN THAT WAY.I MEAN, THE THOUGHT OF HAVING AVIRTUAL PARLIAMENT, IT CAN WORK,BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WORK TO BEDONE.IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE CREATEDIN OUR SENATE A SOCIAL AFFAIR'SCOMMITTEE AND FINANCE COMMITTEETO MEET AND HEAR WITNESSES, TOTAKE ACCOUNT TO WHAT THEGOVERNMENT IS DOING OR NOT DOINGAND HOW SOCIETY IS COPING.SO WE CAN STILL SOUND AS ASECOND THOUGHT AND LISTENING TOCANADIAN'S CONCERNS.

SENATOR, GOOD TO TALK TO YOUABOUT POLITICS AND BEER LEAGUEHOCKEY AND YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TOPEOPLE.

DON'T FORGET TO GIVE, YOUKNOW.STAY ON THE ICE, BUT DO ITTHROUGH MONEY.IT'S AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT.

THANK YOU, SENATOR.GOOD TO SEE YOU,S ALWAYS, STAYHEALTHY,.
