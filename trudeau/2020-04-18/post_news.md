The federalcabinet minister's briefing andpublic health official'spreving. Briefing. Let me give you some informationin the canada relief benefit,the cerb that many of you havetapped into because you havelost work or lost your jobs dueto covid-19 and he says therehave been 7. 9 millionapplications. Just to give you a sense of howmuch the economy is strugglingand how many of you are, too,are turning to the governmentfor support. Catherine cullen has beenlistening along with us and i'mnot sure if anything else stoodout for you. We did get new numbers on covidoutbreaks in differentindigenous communities.

**Reporter**:
Let's talk aboutwhat minister duclos said whenhe was asked about theprotective equipment across thecanada-u. S. border. I thought it was interesting hesaid they'll have to remainvigilant on this particularissue and did note while thecanada-u. S. relationship is agood one, it's one that has beentested and he said it wouldcontinue to be tested over thecourse of the next few weeks,and that goes back to the pointwe were talking about beforethis news conference started. That the government officials donot want to politician italy sata great source this is, as wesee the picture across theproblems and territories and thepicture seems to change fromstate to state, too, and a lotof attention being paid to newyork city state. The government does not want tosay it's a significant concernbut obviously, this 30-day 30-dyextension on the border is arelief to government trying todeal with a large number ofother issue. We heard recurring conversation,once again, with the Prime Minister today, withjean duclos, as well, whencanada can talk aboutrestartingthe economy. It is very clear this is asituation that will change fromregion to region and everyone issaying the watch word is cautionand this needs to be donecautiously and carefully. There's incredible concern abouteasing things too quickly andseeing a major resurgence andeveryone is looking at expectssouth of the border but morebroadly international and ithink singapore comes to mind,where they're trying to restartthe economy and restart society,but concerned that one falsemove could lead to a majoroutbreak. I would note something we'vebeen talking about over thecourse of the programme which isthe situation in long-term carehomes. While they may be in some waysisolated from society morebroadly, they're obviously amajor source of concern rightnow. It's a significant contribution,i guess, we can say, to thenumber of deaths we're seeing incanada right now.

**Rosemary**:
Probably it willlook not only different regionto region, but probably it willlook different in terms ofsociety. Vulnerable people, seniors,older canadians will probably beliving under differentrestrictions than other peoplefor some time because they arethe ones most susceptible. So you can see a ramping down ofmeasures and maybe parks willopen to kick around a soccerball. But restaurants only open at 50%capacity. We are seeing some of thathappening in other parts of theworld and so that gives us someindications of what that mightlook like. Dr. Tam was not there today butmr. Duclos say they remaincautiously optimistic about whatthey are seeing. But again, I think everyone issaying we can't let go nowbecause then everything thatwe've done for past four or fiveweeks will be lost, potentially.

**Reporter**:
That raises acouple of points. One about testing and if I couldecho dr. Tam for a minute and weknow, perhaps, what she mightsay, something we've heardrepeatedly is this question ofthe curve. Yes, perhaps, you've reached thepeak but that's only 50% of thecases and you have to be certainwe've heard her say time andtime again, be mindful of whathappens on the way back down,because that is 50% of thecases. Again, the need for ongoingvigilance. We would talk about testing, aswell, a question ashley burkeraised when speaking to thePrime Minister and she pointedto research out of harvarduniversity which suggests forthe united states to sort ofopen things back up, they needto be doing something in theneighborhood of half a milliontests or upwards of that. Ashley asked the Prime Ministerwhether there was a specificnumber he had been advised offor canada in terms of the levelof testing needed and he did notcertainly come close to engagingin specific numbers, but did saythat, too, is uneven across thecountry. Where there are somesomejurisdictions doing well, hschoosing words carefully, sayingthere are other jurisdictionstrying to improve their efforts. That is one piece of the puzzle. You talk about kicking aroundthe soccer ball and that's anice mental image for us rightnow, but obviously, there aredecisions, too, about what thepicture looks like. I thought when you were speakingabout what's happening -- thediscussion, I should say ofwhat's happening in california,the governor talking about theprospect of ok, perhaps we wouldreopen restaurants, but menuswould be disposable and all ofthe precautions taken. You can imagine that just onefalse move would cause everybodyto snap back, as well. So it's really a very dynamicconversation, but one that ithink people are hungry foranswers to, as well.

THE LEGENDS, OK.AND IT GOT SHUT DOWN, OBVIOUSLY,BECAUSE NO ONE IS ABLE TO DOANYTHING AND WHAT DID YOU GUYSDECIDE TO DO?

WELL, IT WAS A UNANIMOUSDECISION, WE GOT SHUT DOWNBECAUSE OF COVID-19 ON MARCH13th, FRIDAY THE 13th AND NOMORE HOCKEY.BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY LEFTAND A REFUND OF $4,200.SO OUR CHIEF ORGANIZER, WHOTHOUGHT HE'S GOING TO GET A TAXDONATION BACK, A REFUND BACK, HETOPPED IT OFF TO MAKE THE $7,000IN THE KITTY.WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BLOW OUR OWNHORNS BUT SHOW OTHER HOCKEYTEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHATTHEY CAN DO.SO $7,000 HAS GONE TO THE OTTAWAFOOD BANK AND THE OTTAWA MISSIONHELPING THOSE WHO LIVE ONSTREETS AND NEED A SAFE BED.SO $7,000, WE LIKE TO LOOK ATTHIS AS AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT,NOT A GRASS ROOT'S MOVEMENT, BUTAN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT, AND WEARE ENCOURAGING OTHER TEAMSACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLEINVOLVED IN FIGURE SKATING CLUBSTO DONATE MONEY TO THEIRCHARITY, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ACREDIT FOR NEXT YEAR.IT'S NOT MUCH MONEY, BUT ATLEAST IT DOES SOMETHING AND ITSHOWS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWMORE WINGS AND TOO MANY BEERS,THAT WE CAN GIVE BACK TO OURCOMMUNITY.[ Laughter ]

IT'S A SMART IDEA BECAUSE,OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS THE FIRSTWAVE OF SOME SPORTS BEING SHUTDOWN, BUT I'M NOT SURE SOCCERAND OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BESTARTING UP QUICKLY ANY TIMESOON AND THERE MAY BE OTHERPLACES WHERE THAT WILL WORK,TOO.

WELL, OF COURSE, IT WILL.THERE ARE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEUSED LIKE THE RUSTY BLADES ANDTHAT WAS TAKEN.SO A LOT OF US FEEL WE'RELEGENDS IN OUR OWN MINDS AND OUR#HOCKEYLEGENDS HELPED.THIS IS $7,000 AND THIS COULDGROW TO $70,000, $700,000 ACROSSTHE COUNTRY AND, PERHAPS, EVENTHOSE SOCCER TEAMS YOU TALKEDABOUT, THEY MAY HAVE MONEY LINEDUP TO START PRACTICING AND STARTPLAYING.WELL, THEY CAN'T RIGHT NOW, BUTEVEN THAT MONEY, A BIT OF THATMONEY COULD GO A LONG WAY AND ANINDIVIDUAL FIGURE SKATER ORINDIVIDUAL HOCKEY PLAYER COULDUSE THE REFUND TO HELP A CHARITYOF HIS OR HER CHOICE.

IT'S A GOOD IDEA.SENATOR, I'LL ASK YOU THE OTHERPART OF YOUR JOB QUESTION, IFTHAT'S OK.YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE,LOSING TRACK OF TIME, THE SENATEDECIDED IT WOULD SUSPEND SITTINGUNTIL, I THINK, THE BEGINNING OFJUNE.AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE OFCOMMONS IS GRAPPLING WITH THATRIGHT NOW AND THEY HAVE YET TOREACH AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN ON MONDAY.WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

MY THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THATWE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.OUR COMMITTEES CAN MEETVIRTUALLY AND WE CAN PASSLEGISLATION IF LEGISLATION COMESTO US, BUT WE THINK IT'SEXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO LIVE ANDWORK BY EXAMPLE AND WORK FROMHOME AND THERE'S NO PLACE -- WESHOULD NOT BE SITTING IN THESENATE OF CANADA.CANADIANS HAVE BEEN ASKED TOSTAY AT HOME.WE CAN ALSO WORK FROM HOME ANDGET OUR JOBS DONE, WHETHER IT'SADVOCACY OR LEGISLATION.SO WE HAVE POSTPONED UNTILJUNE 2nd.DOESN'T MEAN OUR WORK IS NOTDONE, BUT I THINK THAT TRAVELINGACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIMEIS NOT A SMART THING TO DO.WHAT ARE WE DOING?WE'RE STAYING HOME, WORKING ANDENJOYING OUR FAMILIES AND WE'REGIVING BACK AND AS POLITICIANS,I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY,VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOUS.

YOU PROBABLY WERE IN THESENATE, THOUGH, OVER THE PASTCOUPLE OF WEEKS TO HELP WITH THELEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE INTHE REGION.AND DID IT WORK?WERE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ALIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE?

WE HAD 26 SENATORS THERE ANDEVERYBODY SPOKE ON THE PIECESLEGISLATION THAT WAS BEFORE US.AND THERE WAS PHYSICALDISTANCING, SIX FEET.IT WORKED AND IT CAN WORK AGAIN,BUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE WORKINGON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHENPIECES OF LEGISLATION COME TO USIN THAT WAY.I MEAN, THE THOUGHT OF HAVING AVIRTUAL PARLIAMENT, IT CAN WORK,BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WORK TO BEDONE.IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE CREATEDIN OUR SENATE A SOCIAL AFFAIR'SCOMMITTEE AND FINANCE COMMITTEETO MEET AND HEAR WITNESSES, TOTAKE ACCOUNT TO WHAT THEGOVERNMENT IS DOING OR NOT DOINGAND HOW SOCIETY IS COPING.SO WE CAN STILL SOUND AS ASECOND THOUGHT AND LISTENING TOCANADIAN'S CONCERNS.

SENATOR, GOOD TO TALK TO YOUABOUT POLITICS AND BEER LEAGUEHOCKEY AND YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TOPEOPLE.

DON'T FORGET TO GIVE, YOUKNOW.STAY ON THE ICE, BUT DO ITTHROUGH MONEY.IT'S AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT.

THANK YOU, SENATOR.GOOD TO SEE YOU,S ALWAYS, STAYHEALTHY,.
