**Catherine**:
We know when we look at the two extraordinary sittings we've had is when a deal has been reached, it's an  hour thin
We're going to see people engaged in this issue people biting their nail
There is something of a face-offbetween  party and the conservative part
They do have a deal with the bloc quÉbÉcois and they are close to a deal with the NDP  are really at odds with theconservative
 let's throw another element into this, elizabeth  the green party, was tweeting if there was some sort of agreementthat  require, as she put it, frequent return to the houseof  she wouldn't give unanimous consent to that or letthat  because she thinks it is a public health issu
She was engaging with candace   said she essentially agrees everyone having to come back on monday  be irresponsible, not a good ide
It was implicit and not explicit, she was putting the responsibility on the liberal
We need a deal to make this happe
She said parliament isn't ready for a virtual parliamen
That's something we hear from andrew   and time agai
They have asked the speaker to look into this process, but it would take some tim
There are some technical difficulties that make accountability challengin
At the same time the public health concern is a big on
Candace bergen --  heard the Prime Minister saying some parties want four or five days a wee
Candace bergen  what they would like is thee days a week, 90-minute sessions, with alimited  of MP

She asks why that would be too muc
I think we heard some of that answer from the Prime Minister, as he suggested it is too much of a health ris
So the negotiations continue behind the scene
Not sure whether the comments by the Prime Minister are going to move the discussion alon
I think we'll have to keep watching our e-mai


**Rosemary**:
I think you're righ
The other by the of big news, this concerns everyone, the Canada-US borde


**Catherine**:
a lot of  say, status quo, this is just another 30-day extensio
But it's interesting to watch what has been happening day in and day out with the questions by the medi
Repeatedly reporters ask him to acknowledge what is in many ways think obvious to a lot of Canadians, particularly if you look at new York state right you, they say, sir, is it not apparent that the United States poses an enormous risk to us?and the Prime Minister does not want to acknowledge that, however self-evident that may b
I don't want to speculate on what's going on in the Prime Minister's mind, but there is a question whether he will provokethe United  We have seen the government lurching around during the course of this outbreak as they're dealing with unexpected news from the United State
First there was a report of the United States putting troops on the borde
Then there was donald trump  preventing 3m from sending the much-needed n95 masks to Canad
I think it was interesting towards the end of the conversation, rosemary, the Prime Minister said something to the effect of the deal with the United States that it would be many more week
This deal extends for another 30day
It's not clear if he was suggesting an extension beyond that as well, whether that is something they will be seekin
So much changes in the course ofthe da
Who  where we will be in 30day
The liberals have pushed that issue back for another 30 day


**Rosemary**:
 that's grea
We'll come back to yo
You'll be on standb
The Prime Minister spoke of the requirement to wear a mask when you're getting on a plan
The Prime Minister making it clear that you shouldn't be travelling, that non-essential travel shouldn't be happen, but if you are required for some reason to get on a plane, you are required to wear a mas
The other substance of the announcement was the decision toallow $306  in loans and some non-refundable payments to indigenous small- and medium-sized businesse
This is another sector obviouslythat's been hard hit by COVID-1
We saw  government try to getmoney to particular  yesterda
a bit of a continuation of that toda
If I'm not mistaken, there's something like 
000 indigenous businesses across the countr
Tabatha bull joins me from toront


**Interview**:
Thanks for having m


**Rosemary**:
How needed was this going to be?was there a real desire for additional money for specifically indigenous businesses?



**Interview**:
Absolutel
There are actually over 5
000 indigenous businesses across  and 95% of those are small- and medium-sized businesse
In march we sent a letter to theprime Minister and the COVID-19  along with a number of our friends including the national aboriginal capital commission, which the Prime Minister mentioned toda
We wanted to ensure there was a way that small- and medium-sizedenterprises could  the liquidity and capital that was going out through the community emergency business accoun
This is a much-needed and welcome announcemen


**Rosemary**:
This is because a lot of indigenous companies use indigenous institutions,  primaril
So this will go directly to those, instead of to a traditional bank, as you say?



**Interview**:
That's righ
a number of indigenous businesses are also -- about 65%of them are financed through their own personal savings or loan
They're not an existing client and Reba is for existing client
So we needed another route to access the capital and liquidit


**Rosemary**:
Another thing that struck me from what the Prime Minister said, and this is something we're seeing through various sectors, is that many of these businesses are owned and employ indigenous wome
Can you give us a picture of that and how important it i
I know it's hit a lot of sectors in the service industr
Give us a picture of that in terms of indigenous businesse


**Interview**:
So we definitely see women more -- double the amount of women are innovating and coming into the indigenous entrepreneu
a lot of that helps for them to have a flexible schedule, not unlike women across the countr
a lot of the sectors hit initially were sectors where you would have a personal interaction, such as touris
Those are sectors where we see higher women-owned businesse
We've seen a higher impact on indigenous wome


**Rosemary**:
Are there other things needed?the Prime Minister said this is the first ste
These policy decisions being pushed out the door quickly are sometimes not the final versio
is there anything else you're looking for?



**Interview**:
Definitel
We've been working closely with the government on a number of the programs that have already been establishe
I don't think it's intentional, but I think there's a number of factors in those programs that excludes indigenous businesse
The wage subsidy is an example, aboriginal economic development corporations, who are a limited partnership with their community, but employ up to 800 indigenous people and a number of those organizations are currently excluded from the wage subsidy just by the way their limited partnership is set u
So we're working closely with the government to try to understand tha
Some of those businesses have laid off over half of their employees, and those are businesses that put back programming into the communit
We need to make sure they can access that wage subsid
Additionally procurement, we have a number of indigenous business members who are able to supply POE and able to pivot to ensure we can all fight COVID-19 togethe
I would like to see some type of incentives that we can ensure that those indigenous businesses have an opportunity to be part of the fight against  particularly when they can support loss of life in indigenous communities that are at a higher risk of this pandemi


**Rosemary**:
You're talking about companies switching their supply chains to create things like masks?



**Interview**:
Definitel
We have seen a couple of our indigenous members who have pivoted to ethanol and producing hand sanitize and a number of businesses too who have been able to access mask
Another great business  has been able to pivot to  We want to make sure those businesses have an opportunity to be part of the the federal supply chain and also to provide support to communitie


**Rosemary**:
Tabatha, thanks for making time for u


**Interview**:
Thanks so muc


**Rosemary**:
That is the Prime Minister's substantial announcement of aid today, $306 million of loans or non-repayable funds to go to indigenous businesses, of which there are many across the countr

When trump expresses impatienceand a strong desire to reopenthe   does thatworry 



**Answer**:
As an economis
Given the current circumstance
If we want to reopen  then we must be ver
Very cautious, especially when it comes to public healt
We have made major sacrifices these past few week
We have been isolated and we have felt anxious and we have also made economic sacrifice
People have lost their job
People are having difficulty making ends mee
So we always have to weigh public health outcomes and economic outcomes..in the next few weeks andmonths,  will have to be ver
Very cautiou

JUST ANOTHER SENATOR, ROSIE,NOT PLAYING HOCKEY.[ Laughter ]



THAT'S RIGHT.THERE'S A LOT OF THEM THESE DAY.SO YOU HAVE THIS LEAGUE, I GUESSLIKE A FUN LEAGUE, ARECREATIONAL LEAGU


WE ARE THE LEGEND


THE LEGENDS, OK.AND IT GOT SHUT DOWN, OBVIOUSLY,BECAUSE NO ONE IS ABLE TO DOANYTHING AND WHAT DID YOU GUYSDECIDE TO DO?



WELL, IT WAS A UNANIMOUSDECISION, WE GOT SHUT DOWNBECAUSE OF COVID-19 ON MARCH13th, FRIDAY THE 13th AND NOMORE HOCKEY.BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY LEFTAND A REFUND OF $4,200.SO OUR CHIEF ORGANIZER, WHOTHOUGHT HE'S GOING TO GET A TAXDONATION BACK, A REFUND BACK, HETOPPED IT OFF TO MAKE THE $7,000IN THE KITTY.WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BLOW OUR OWNHORNS BUT SHOW OTHER HOCKEYTEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHATTHEY CAN DO.SO $7,000 HAS GONE TO THE OTTAWAFOOD BANK AND THE OTTAWA MISSIONHELPING THOSE WHO LIVE ONSTREETS AND NEED A SAFE BED.SO $7,000, WE LIKE TO LOOK ATTHIS AS AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT,NOT A GRASS ROOT'S MOVEMENT, BUTAN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMENT, AND WEARE ENCOURAGING OTHER TEAMSACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLEINVOLVED IN FIGURE SKATING CLUBSTO DONATE MONEY TO THEIRCHARITY, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ACREDIT FOR NEXT YEAR.IT'S NOT MUCH MONEY, BUT ATLEAST IT DOES SOMETHING AND ITSHOWS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF A FEWMORE WINGS AND TOO MANY BEERS,THAT WE CAN GIVE BACK TO OURCOMMUNITY.[ Laughter ]

WELL, OF COURSE, IT WILL.THERE ARE OTHER NAMES WE HAVEUSED LIKE THE RUSTY BLADES ANDTHAT WAS TAKEN.SO A LOT OF US FEEL WE'RELEGENDS IN OUR OWN MINDS AND OUR#HOCKEYLEGENDS HELPED.THIS IS $7,000 AND THIS COULDGROW TO $70,000, $700,000 ACROSSTHE COUNTRY AND, PERHAPS, EVENTHOSE SOCCER TEAMS YOU TALKEDABOUT, THEY MAY HAVE MONEY LINEDUP TO START PRACTICING AND STARTPLAYING.WELL, THEY CAN'T RIGHT NOW, BUTEVEN THAT MONEY, A BIT OF THATMONEY COULD GO A LONG WAY AND ANINDIVIDUAL FIGURE SKATER ORINDIVIDUAL HOCKEY PLAYER COULDUSE THE REFUND TO HELP A CHARITYOF HIS OR HER CHOIC


IT'S A GOOD IDEA.SENATOR, I'LL ASK YOU THE OTHERPART OF YOUR JOB QUESTION, IFTHAT'S OK.YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE,LOSING TRACK OF TIME, THE SENATEDECIDED IT WOULD SUSPEND SITTINGUNTIL, I THINK, THE BEGINNING OFJUNE.AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE OFCOMMONS IS GRAPPLING WITH THATRIGHT NOW AND THEY HAVE YET TOREACH AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT'SGOING TO HAPPEN ON MONDAY.WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?



MY THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THATWE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.OUR COMMITTEES CAN MEETVIRTUALLY AND WE CAN PASSLEGISLATION IF LEGISLATION COMESTO US, BUT WE THINK IT'SEXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO LIVE ANDWORK BY EXAMPLE AND WORK FROMHOME AND THERE'S NO PLACE -- WESHOULD NOT BE SITTING IN THESENATE OF CANADA.CANADIANS HAVE BEEN ASKED TOSTAY AT HOME.WE CAN ALSO WORK FROM HOME ANDGET OUR JOBS DONE, WHETHER IT'SADVOCACY OR LEGISLATION.SO WE HAVE POSTPONED UNTILJUNE 2nd.DOESN'T MEAN OUR WORK IS NOTDONE, BUT I THINK THAT TRAVELINGACROSS THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIMEIS NOT A SMART THING TO DO.WHAT ARE WE DOING?WE'RE STAYING HOME, WORKING ANDENJOYING OUR FAMILIES AND WE'REGIVING BACK AND AS POLITICIANS,I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY,VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOU


YOU PROBABLY WERE IN THESENATE, THOUGH, OVER THE PASTCOUPLE OF WEEKS TO HELP WITH THELEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE INTHE REGION.AND DID IT WORK?WERE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ALIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE?



WE HAD 26 SENATORS THERE ANDEVERYBODY SPOKE ON THE PIECESLEGISLATION THAT WAS BEFORE US.AND THERE WAS PHYSICALDISTANCING, SIX FEET.IT WORKED AND IT CAN WORK AGAIN,BUT I THINK IT HAS TO BE WORKINGON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHENPIECES OF LEGISLATION COME TO USIN THAT WAY.I MEAN, THE THOUGHT OF HAVING AVIRTUAL PARLIAMENT, IT CAN WORK,BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WORK TO BEDONE.IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE CREATEDIN OUR SENATE A SOCIAL AFFAIR'SCOMMITTEE AND FINANCE COMMITTEETO MEET AND HEAR WITNESSES, TOTAKE ACCOUNT TO WHAT THEGOVERNMENT IS DOING OR NOT DOINGAND HOW SOCIETY IS COPING.SO WE CAN STILL SOUND AS ASECOND THOUGHT AND LISTENING TOCANADIAN'S CONCERN


SENATOR, GOOD TO TALK TO YOUABOUT POLITICS AND BEER LEAGUEHOCKEY AND YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TOPEOPL


DON'T FORGET TO GIVE, YOUKNOW.STAY ON THE ICE, BUT DO ITTHROUGH MONEY.IT'S AN ICE HOCKEY MOVEMEN


THANK YOU, SENATOR.GOOD TO SEE YOU,S ALWAYS, STAYHEALTHY,.
