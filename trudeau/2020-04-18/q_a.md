**Question**:
Hello, I have aquestion for minister duclos. Minister, we have extended theborder measures with the unitedstates. Have we obtained any guaranteesthat we will be able to receiveessential medical supplies fromthe united states without anyhiccups at the border or withoutany issues with the trumpadministration?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. Thank you for the question. As you have mentioned., ourrelationship with the unitedstates is very important in thiscontext and all contexts. In the current situation, ouru. S.-canada relations are veryimportant. We have conversations with ourpartners every single day. The border agreement that wereached a few weeks ago has beenextended for another 30 days. And we need to ensure thecontinued flow of essentialsupplies, food, medicines. Have we received a guarantee tothat effect?

YES, AND WE ARECONFIDENT IN EXTENDING THIS DEALFOR ANOTHER 30 DAYS.AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVEDISCUSSIONS ABOUT OTHER TOPICSWITH A VIEW OF FLOWING SUPPLIESACROSS THE BORDER IN BOTHDIRECTIONS.OUR CANADA-U.S. RELATIONS AREVERY IMPORTANT AND ARE VERYPOSITIVE AND WE WORK VERY HARDTO MAINTAIN A GOOD, STRONGRELATIONSHIP.I WAS SAYING WHAT MOST CANADIANSUNDERSTAND IS THAT THERELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FRIEND ANDNEIGHBOUR IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANTIN ALL ASPECTS BUT ABSOLUTELYESSENTIAL IN THE CURRENTEMERGENCY CONTEXT.WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE FACTTHAT WE WERE ABLE TO RENEGOTIATETHE AGREEMENT THAT WE HADACHIEVED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGOFOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS, WHICHACHIEVES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTOBJECTIVES, BUT ONE IS THEABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO KEEP THEMOVEMENT OF ESSENTIAL GOODS ANDSERVICES ACROSS THE FRONTEIRS INBOTH WAY.BECAUSE GOODS GO SOUTH, NORTHAND THOSE GOODS, MEDICAL, FOODAND OTHER THINGS ARE FOREIGNMAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND HEALTHOF CANADIANS.

**Question**:
I have a veryspecific question about personalprotective equipment at theborder. Have you received a guaranteesfrom the american governmentthat 3m and other americancompanies will be able to exportmedical supplies and protectiveequipment to canada?will we be able to import thesesupplies from americancompanies?have you received a guaranteefrom that effect from theamerican government?will we be able to receivemedical supplies and especiallypersonal protective equipment?

**Answer**:
Minister duclous. S.the word word is vigilant. These past few weeks, we haveobserved that essential goodsincluding medicine have beenable to flow across the bordervery well, but the motto isvigilance. Yes, we have a very goodrelationship with the americangovernment, but thisrelationship will continue to beput to the test over the nextfew weeks. We will remain vigilant toensure that our canada-u. S.relationship, which is currentlyvery strong, we will ensure thatit continues to remain strong inthe next few weeks. The essential discussion inaction that we have around thetransit of medical goods and ithink we first must admit thatthings are going quite well withefforts on both sides of thefrontier, meaning we havemedical goods in both directionsin the current crisis. This being said, we need to bevigilant because thatrelationship is going to betested for the rest of thecrisis. We have citizens on both sidesof the border that are anxious,that are in need of beingreassured and that's exactlywhat the responsibility of thefellow government is, is to notonly to provide the essentialflow of those medical goods butalso to reassure canadians thatwe will always be working in therelationship and movement ofthose goods.

THANK YOU, MINISTER.NEXT QUESTION.

**Question**:
Mellow. I have questionsfor minister duclos. For a question about militarymedics being sent into long-termcare facilities in quebec as oftoday. The government hasn't given usmuch detail about where theywill go. They mentioned the st region. Could you tell us where thesemilitary medics are sent todayand how many are sent and towhich regions?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. Thank you for your question. I would like to thank actors inboth governments who have workedhard to make this happen very,very quickly. We all recognise the urgency ofthe situation the government ofquebec has a primaryresponsibility to handle thesituation, but the federalgovernment is also responsiblefor quickly stepping in to helpafter receiving the request thatwe received. 125 medically trained forceswill be deployed in quebec. The government of quebec willmanage their deployment. The government of quebec willidentify it's needs, where theneeds are on the ground and thegovernment of quebec will decidewhat responsibilities thesearmed force's members will have. We've heard it is satisfied withhow quickly we have stepped into make this happen. These individuals will be sentto facilities where needs arepressing. The government of quebec issatisfied and that said, thefederal government must continueto help in any way that it can,given the importance and urgencyof the situation.

Now a followupquestion.

**Question**:
I'm getting theimpression you don't know wherethe needs are dire and maybe youcan answer on minister freeland. There was a minister's call withthe provisional and territorialpremiers and remuneration ofessential workers was discussed. Had a deal been reached withprovinces regarding salarypop-ups for essential workexperts what decisions have beentaken and which workers willreceive these top-ups.

**Answer**:
We are starting torealize in quebec and everywherein canada that many essentialworkers are not sufficientlyremixer n e. R.a. T derick. Remunerated. Another element you mentioned isthat the government of quebecwants to help provinces andterritories and everyone wantsto help essential workers. As minister freeland said, thesetalks are going well. Everyone is on the same wavelength. Now it's a matter of finding theright ways to act, the rightways for the federal governmentto provide financial support andsalary pop-ups. There are jurisdictional issuesand the government of canada, ofcourse, wants to providesupport, but must do so in sucha way that they protect thejurisdictions.

**Question**:
B. C.'s success iscredited with good tracing andontario seems to be laggingbehind. Will the federal government stepin and mandate provinces toincrease testing and are youconcerned that provinces thatare lagging behind will pulldown those that have come ahead?

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT INDESCRIBING TESTING AND TRACINGAS BEING KEY AND ACTIONS IN THECOVID-19 PROCESS.WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THATDIFFERENT PROVINCES FACEDIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.AND IN QUEBEC AND THE FEDERALGOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS NOT ONLYWILLING BUT MOST OFTEN ALWAYSABLE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THATMAY BE HELPFUL IN THE LOCALCIRCUMSTANCES AND PROVIDE ANYLOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND ANYPROCUREMENT SUPPORT WHEN ITCOMES TO MAKING EQUIPMENT ANDTESTING EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TOPROVINCES AND TERRITORIES.SO WE WANT TO DO THIS AS MUCH ASIS NEEDED AND THAT'S WHAT WEWILL CONTINUE TO DO.

WELL, THAT'S MAKING ENDS NEATMEETIS A LARGE SOURCE OF ANXIETDPARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME ANDTHAT'S WHY WE ACTED VERY QUICKLYPUTTING INTO PLACE MEASURES THATTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CERTAINLYNEVER IMPLEMENTED AND PROBABLYNEVER ENVISIONED, SUCH AS THECANADA EMERGENCY RESPONSEBENEFIT, BUT ALSO INCREASING THEGST TAX CREDIT, PROVIDINGSUPPORT TO FAMILIES WITHCHILDREN AND IN PARTICULAR,FAMILIES WITH LOWER NEXTSTHROUGH THE CHILD CANADABENEFIT.AS THE PRIME MINISTER KEEPSSAYING, WE ARE WORKING IN ANEMERGENCY SITUATION WHICHREQUIRES CONTINUING ACTIONS ANDCONTINUING FORMS OF SUPPORT.SO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ASTHE PRIME MINISTER AGAIN SAID,CONTINUE BEING MINDFUL OF THEANXIETY AND THE DIFFICULTCIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THECANADIANS ARE GOING THROUGH, BUTALSO RENEWING AND DEVELOPING OURCONTINUING SUPPORT TO THOSECANADIANS.

**Question**:
My question is forminister duclos. You spoke about how thecanada-u. S. relationship will betested in the upcoming weeks. When trump expresses impatienceand a strong desire to reopenthe american economy, does thatworry you?

**Answer**:
As an economist,given the current circumstances,if we want to reopen theeconomy, then we must be very,very cautious, especially whenit comes to public health. We have made major sacrificesthese past few weeks. We have been isolated and wehave felt anxious and we havealso made economic sacrifices. People have lost their jobs. People are having difficultymaking ends meet. So we always have to weighpublic health outcomes andeconomic outcomes..in the next few weeks andmonths, we will have to be very,very cautious. Of course, many of us areanxious to reopen the economy. That said, we must absolutelyfollow the recommendations ofour public health experts. We must take the necessarypublic health measures if wewant to reopen the economy. Followup question.

---

**Question**:
All right. So that was your economist'spoint of view. Now what's your point of view asa canadian, as a canadiancitizen?president trump wants peoplemoving around freely as soon aspossible. How do you feel about that?could that compromise publichealth and safety in canada?

**Answer**:
Minister duclassociation. Os. No, i'm not worried. Our public health experts arevery trustworthy and moreover,our municipalities, provincesand territories are doing suchan excellent job when it comesto public health and spreadingpublic health messages. I think we can be very proud tobe canadian right now. Our healthcare system is robustand at some point, we willreopen the economy. The federal government has avery solid financial position,so we will be able to roar backat some point and when we wantto roar back, it will beessential that all levels ofgovernment cooperate and worktogether all while respectingpublic health measures. So when we're ready to roarback, all levels of governmentwill work together and we willreopen the economy. Thank you, minister. That concludes today's pressconference.
