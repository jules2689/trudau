With respect to those masks that were supposed to be coming from 3m, we know that it was extremely complicated because of the directives announced by president trum
Did you not think it would be a good idea to get some additional guarantees so that all those companies providing gowns and masks and so forth can continue to provide that equipment to Canada, so that we don't have to continue to rely on china?



**Answer**:
Yes, it is very important that we continue to receive essential protective equipment from around the worl
Including the United State
We were very pleased to be able to ensure the continuity of 3m shipments, but we will continue to work closely with the US administration so that we are sure to receive all the equipment we nee

We believe that this measure will help people in situations where physical distancing, like in a plane, is very difficult toachiev
 regarding the measures being put in plac
Once we begin to relax the current restrictions, certainly that is still under discussion and we are having lengthy discussions with scientists as to what the best measures would be to ensure the protection of all Canadian

**Question**:
The conservatives want increased sittings in the house of commons and they argue that the daily briefings done in front of the media could be done in the house of common
What's wrong with that?



**Answer**:
First of all, it's extremely important and has been important that every single day the Canadian public gets informed of measures we are putting forwar
We are putting forward new measures almost every single day, and I think it is essential that the media continues to have access to asking questions to better inform and to ensure Canada is functioning the way it needs to b
Part of that job in our democracy is ensuring that there is accountability through our parliamentary system
That is something that we are also very much focused o
We have proposed that the house of commons return in some fashion every single week, to permit engagement on accountability and also pass further measures to help Canadian
Right now we're in a situation where MP's across the country and their staff are wondering ifthey're going to have to get on planes tomorrow and fly to  Obviously that is not something from a public health standpoint we should want to see happenin
Right now on the books the rule is parliament needs to re-open fully on monda
 is obviously not a good idea, which is why we've proposed measures going forward that we're discussing with the other partie
We certainly hope we can come toan  so we all don't have to convene in the house of commons on monday  french] [voice of interpreter] we are still in discussions with the other partie
We have proposed that the house of commons sit every week to ensure that there is an opportunity to ask questions of the government and also to be able to pass other measures thatwill help  The reality is that monday morning 338  of parliament and the teams are supposed to be in ottaw
They  expected to be in ottawa then  that parliament can reconven
Obviously that would not be a good idea in the current contex
Now we have made proposals to ensure that we can get work doneand keep  democracy working and healthy, while also keeping people saf
and we really hope that the other parties will agree with these proposals because I do think it would be a terrible problem if we all had to return to parliament on monday.[end of

**Question**:
Many people on social distance programs are surviving on less than people who are getting the  Many marginalized Canadians will simply never be able to access the CERB as it is structure
Rather than continue to tweak it, why not just make the CERB universal?



**Answer**:
We moved very quickly on replacing income for people who lost a paycheque because of  These are families who were relying on that next paycheque to be able to pay for rent, to be able to pay for groceries, to be able to support their children and their parent
This was the absolute priority that we needed to move forward quickly o
With the moves that we were able to make, over 
5 million payments have been made already and there are obviously many more to com
At the same time, we recognize the particular vulnerability of marginalized communities of particular group
That's why we have put forward significant measures to try to help them, whether it's through shelters and support for charities and charitable organizations, or extending measures so people who work a very small amount of hours a month can still receive the  These are kinds of things we're looking at, and we're continuing to move forward to get the help out to people we need t

**Question**:
Good morning, Prime Ministe
You've been holding regular calls with the ministers, but why have you not reached out to the opposition in a similar way particularly when you're governing in a minority government?



**Answer**:
We have been in close and ongoing conversations with opposition leaders, both me directly and mostly through ministers and officials and regular briefings happen from health Canada and officials to keep people apprised of these issue
You're absolutely righ
We do need to keep our institutions and our parliamentary institutions strong, which is why we've proposed parliament could come back in a modified way every single way to ensure accountability, to ensure we can move forward on legislatio
That's what we're very much hoping we're going to get agreement on from all partie
The alternative would be returning to Ottawa on Monday morning with a full house of commons and all the staff associated wit
I think we can all recognize that that would be a mistake at this poin

**Question**:
Some of the changes your government has made to the Canada emergency response benefit for workers, the wage subsidy initiative for businesses, and the recent revisions regarding emergency loans and commercial rent assistance for small businesses were proposed by the opposition partie

**Answer**:
We have been looping in leaders and opposition leaders from the very beginnin

**Question**:
Today you said small business owners are at the heart of so many communities, but small businesses are terrified at the possibility of getting out of this and having enormous debt piled on in the form of rent deferrals and loan
The fear is they will run out of money a year down the roa
Have you considered financial aid that would not have to be repaid or discuss rent forgiveness or control with the provinces?



**Answer**:
We have discussed the issue of commercial rent with the province
I had a good conversation with them on Thursday evening where this came u
We are looking at it very, very closel
We have a number of proposals that are working their way through the system, talking to various industry groups and renters' associations, as well as looking at the province
The provinces have jurisdictions over rents and the relationship between landlords and tenant
We need to work with them, which is what we are doin
We recognize there are very different realities and systems right across the country, but we also have heard very, very clearly from small business owners that the wage subsidy is helpful, but fixed costs are a real concer
That is something that we're going to have more to say on soo

Ian wood CTV new
Prime Minister, BC has seen some success flattening the curve and has indicated it may look at loosening restriction
You've said it is too soon and provinces like Ontario and quÉbec are still in the thick  Are you concerned the difference in messaging will enable people to disregard what is in place now?are you going to allow the provinces make the decision on re-opening or will the federal government need to give the green light?



**Answer**:
I think Canadians understand what we are doing now has been tough but is essential in getting through this in the best-possible wa
Canadians are really worried if we reopen too quickly or too soon or in the wrong way, we could find ourselves back in this situation a couple of months from no
Everything we will have sacrificed during these months will have been for naugh

What is the specific number of tests that Canada needs to hit daily to safely ease up restrictions here?



**Answer**:
I think every day we are working on new technologie
On better coordination, on accelerating the pace of testin
It has been somewhat uneven across the countr
There are places that have done very, very wel
There are some places that have faced challenges that they are busy overcomin
We are confident we are going to significantly ramp up testin
All the premiers recognize that extensive testing is an essential part of any plan to loosen the controls on people and start reopening or restarting the econom
This is something that the federal government is very much engaged in with the provinces, ensuring there are enough test
There are enough swabs, there are enough reagent

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] radio-Canad
Good morning, m
 I have a rather simple questio
Why are we extending the closureof  border with the United States?is it because you are concerned that president trump may want tolift the  measures or do you think that they're not able to properly manage the pandemic?what is the reason?



**Answer**:
Well, we closed our borders to international travellers many weeks ag
That included people from every country in the worl
We took a few days more to do that with the United States because we needed to ensure that this could be done in a coordinated manner that would allow us to keep our supply chains ope
We wanted to do it in cooperation with our closest partner and all
So these measures were absolutely critical in order to protect Canadians and limit the spread of the viru
We will keep them in place in relation to the United States and all the other countries around the globe for many, many weeks to come.[end of translation] we made thedecision a number of weeks ago to close our borders to international traveller
We recognized that this was a significant measure but was an important one in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19  coming in from oversea
It has contributed to why we arenow  many parts of the countrytalking  seeing a flattening of the curve, which is good new
We agreed with the united states in those measures because these are measures we put in place around the worl
We did take a couple more days to ensure that we were properly coordinated with our closest neighbour and most-important trading partne
That was effective in it being amutually agreed  and coordinated measur
We will continue those measure
Both with the United States and the world, for what is undoubtedly going to be many more week

**Question**:
[speaking french] [voice of interpreter] with respect to the negotiations with the opposition about parliamen
Why has there not been any agreement yet?you're able to agree with the United State
What is blocking the agreement?can you not put some water in your wine?



**Answer**:
Well, we are dealing with a situation where a number of members of the various parties agree that we should move forward with measures that will require or lead to a limited parliament every week, but there are also others that want a parliament to be sitting four or five days a wee
I don't think that's the right thing to d
It's not the right balanc
We are pursuing those discussions now.[end of translation] many parties, opposition parties, arein  that limited sittings every week are a good measure to both ensure accountability and continue the work that we're needing to do topass  for Canadian
We are of course looking forwardto  able to see more virtual parliamentary sittings that will allow MPs  all around the country, not just thenational  region, being able to part
There is still one party that wants more than I think is wise at this point in time in terms of a public safety approach and in ensuring we are getting that balance right in moving forward for protecting our institution
But we're hopeful we will get toa  place soo
