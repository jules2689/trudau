**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking outside of his home at Rideau cottage to give us some significant news today.
Both about the temporary closure of the border, which will be now limited to essential travel.
So, recreation, tourism, those kinds of things, totally off the table now.
But goods that need to go back and forth across the border will continue to do so as well as essential work that might be needed.
Which will be re-assuring to people that have to do that.
The Prime Minister also announcing $27 billion in direct payments to Canadians and we'll go through some of those measures with My colleagues and $55 billion in tax deferrals.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane.
In terms of amount, I was pretty much what we expected, $27 billion.
That is all direct payments to Canadians that will start, the Prime Minister said, in the next few weeks.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and through, as David has been reporting since last night, existing programmes.
The first big chunk of it is for people who don't qualify for e. I. for example, if you have to take sick days because we've been told by public health officials even if we're feeling mildly ill, we don't know it's coronavirus or could be something else, you should be staying home.
It looks like you will be able to access e. I. through two various programmes, one entitled COVID-19, emergency support.
Another one as an emergency care programme.
and this will last for up to 15 weeks at this point.
Obviously subject to change.
But essentially you'll get as much as you would on e. I., which is up to $900 for a two-week span every two weeks.
There is a number of other things including for small business owners, for example.
a lot of people who can't keep their employees on the payroll if they don't have any revenue coming in. The government is offering a 10% wage subsidy, a temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months to enchurch courage them, the Prime Minister says, to keep those employees on the payroll.
Parents, a lot of parents who obviously have to stay home because pretty much schools across the country are shut down.
Daycare services in much of the country as well.
So if you have to stay home to care for your kids, you will be able to access those previous programmes I spoke of or boosting through the Canada-child benefit, the payments that you would get there.
and they're also increasing the g. S.t. Credit.
I know it is a lot of information.
But this was all a handed to us just through this press conference.
Increasing the g. S.t. Credit as well as a six-month moratorium on student loan payments and that will be -- you won't accrue any interest or have to pay any interest at the end of that period as well.
The other big thing is taxes.
They have extended -- and this is a big one for a lot of people watching, knowing that that deadline was coming up. Extend the tax filing deadline for individuals to June 1 and allow all taxpayers to defer until after August 31 of 2020.
Basically until September.
If you file your taxes and end up owing something, you don't have to pay it until September and there won't be any interest or penalties for not paying it during that time as well.
and that is where that sort of second big chunk that you referenced, $55 billion in tax deferrals, that is where that comes in. Because that is going to be really important.
Not only for individuals, but for businesses, too.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. We have about five minutes until the finance Minister pops up. Just let me say two things, David.
I'll let you go in. There is targeted money for indigenous community obviously in a remote community, things are different.
So, there's $305 million for indigenous communities.
a support fund needed there.
and just to give people an example of how this might work, these new e. I. measures.
If you are sick or if you have to stay home and look after someone who's sick, you can tap into that if you don't qualify for e. Ism and that is really important because lots of people don't. They're either self-employed or haven't qualified yet.
David, you go ahead on what you thought was, I guess, the central message from the Prime Minister about it sounds like this is not necessarily over yet, either.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Look.
He's essentially said if you don't qualify for e. I., you will now qualify for something equivalent to e. I., the mechanics of it need to be worked out.
But there are two programmes that cover everyone from the sick to self-employed or people who their hours they need.
You will look at it from an employment insurance level.
The message from Canadians is they do not want financial pressures compromising the national public health crisis.
and that you don't feel obligated to put yourself at risk financially to take on work you shouldn't be doing to do things you shouldn't be doing in. a way that will compromise the need for a national public health response.
So, that is important.
The numbers are also quite eye popping.
We had the $27 billion roughly on direct aid.
But this is $82 billion, which is 3% of the g. D.p. In total stimulus measures that Vassy has outlined f. You can't keep up with it, we can barely keep up with it, too.
This 82 billion is on top of the $10 billion in credit that was extented to small and medium-sized businesses on Friday and on top of the $1 billion that was announced on Wednesday of last week to boost the health response.
The national response to this in a week is $93 billion and it's just beginning.
Because if you look at the measures that were outlined here today, they all last for a minimum of 12 to 14 weeks which gives you a sense of the low end of the duration.
That this government is preparing the country for, with the national response to COVID-19. You've got a three-month financial floor under a lot of people, under a lot of businesses.
There is money there for farm credit Canada to really help trade sensitive sectors that are going to be really hurt by border closures and the lack of traffic and bringing in temporary workers, for example, to work in the agricultural sector with the promise of even more to come.
We have tourism and travel.
The tech sector, for instance, that may support back-end support to retailers ins this country that often take years to get to profitability.
They are in a real lur.
-- lurch right now because of the global shutdown of in-store commerce in most countries.
This is a significant response, 3% of the g. M. on top of what was already announced.
More to come and it is going to take several, several months, rosey, before this starts to look like normal.



**Rosemary**:

Right.
and the Prime Minister is saying that he wants to ensure that our economy can rebound when this is all over.
I'm going to put you two on hold, if I can.
We're standing by for the finance Minister.
Let's bring in Gareth Watson, a financial advisor, and he joins us now.
Anything there that surprises you? it does sound like no matter where you are, working in the Canadian economy, there is an answer for you in terms of aid from the government.



I think the key here thing, rosey, first of all s that liquidity is trying to be provided to consumersful normally we look to central banks to provide liquidity to banks and financial institutions.
Here the government is reaching out directly to consumers and the $27 billion, of course, was expected.
That is about $720 per Canadian.
In terms of whether this is just the start, I have to say, yes, it is just a start.
I know you were talking or David was talk about $93 billion.
We have to understand a lot here, if you look to that release, there is a lot of the word deferral in here a lot.
It is not a forgiveness.
It's a deferral.
Eventually people will be expected to pay their mortgage and will be expected to pay their, thats.
They are not cut a break on those.
The number is absolutely huge in terms of providing that liquidity.
For me, the big concern is the implementation and infrastructure we have to put it into work and get it into hands quickly.
We'll have the finance Minister answer some of those questions soon.



**Rosemary**:

It could be available through e. I. measures but if you don't equal fie for e. Ism, I take your point.
I don't know how you get that into your hands.
Can you explain that the $55 billion in tax deferral, this is just the money that Canadians would have normally paid that would now be put off and the intent behind that, in terms of the economy, is what? just to allow them more money to spend?



To hold on to what they have for now.
and if they have employees, keep them employed.
Basically the Prime Minister is saying, look, right now this is not our focus is to collect your taxes.
Keep that money.
If it helps, you keep people employed.
Please do so. If it helps you continue your business, please do so. and, you know, that's just -- right now, the key here is credit.
Ok. we can talk about equities and stocks all you want.
But the credit markets are the key to survival of the economy.
and in any economy, quite frankly, and you'll see that in the United States as well.
The flow of money in the economy is what is key.
If that stops, then we're in trouble.
Right now the government is saying, first of all the bank of Canada is saying we're going to keep the money flowing to financial institutions.
That's kaoefm and now the government saying -- it's not necessarily slowing to Canadians but making sure they can keep what they've got so they can spend it because they need it.



**Rosemary**:

How is this different? it is not at all comparable, I understand, to 2008.
But are there measures here that are different or similar or make sense given what we experienced in 2008?



In terms of measures, this is far more responsive.
We as Canadians are being far more directly impacted than the financial crisis.
That was more an American story than a Canadian story.
I would say, though, that if right now it's not the exact same as 200028.
But if credit and liquidity dries up, it can become 2008.
I'm not saying that to scare people.
But I do want your viewers to be aware of the fact that liquidity and credit are key here and if the economy does slow down and grind to a halt, then that is going to be the biggest concern.



**Rosemary**:

But there seems to be an awareness of that, wouldn't you say, from both the bank of Canada and the government? yeah.
In terms of -- and that would speak to the measures that they put in place last week.



Last Friday was key to have the finance Minister and the central bank governor all together on stage in the united front talking about making sure, look, we have the backs of financial institutions, we're here for you and we have the backs of Canadians.
To be fair, both the central bank and the government alone cannot fix this problem.
At the end of the day, it is you and me, a societal response that will get us through this.
They're just trying to soften the blow.
They won't solve the problem.
They will just help us through it. At the end of the day, it is everyday Canadians that are going to get us through this problem.



**Rosemary**:

One last question.
The Prime Minister made it clear that there that this is not necessarily the end of government measures.
$27 billion in direct payments.
They say they have certain fiscal capacity.
is there still room here for Canada to dole out more money if needed?



I hope so. I think there is another way to come.
We're addressing the first direct wave of people that are impacted.
and you can go through all the different industries and we already have in terms of those that are directly hit.
There is going to be secondary industries that rely on the first industries that are eventually going to have problems and that is where some of these programmes will be expanded.
But just to put things into perspective, $27 billion is just north of $700 a Canadian.
In the United States, with the trillion dollar package, they're pouting together, that is north of $3, 000 American.
and I'm not saying that we have the capacity to do what the Americans are doing because they are the formation people of the world.
But it does illustrate that perhaps we do have some capacity to go higher and certainly don't think that the Prime Minister has put all the things in the first round.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Appreciate it very much.
Gareth Watson is in Toronto.
Let's bring back My colleagues to talk a little bit more.
Can we talk a little bit about the border because I -- I guess I understood some of it. I am not sure I heard a timeline.
I'm not sure if either of you did.
is this happening in a week, a month, tomorrow? I'm not sure anyone was that precise about anything.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I'm not sure either.
Good point, rosey.
I was really listening for, and I know our colleagues in the newsroom as well, what exactly does this definition -- what does it mean for specific people? so, My understanding is that truckers, for example, will still be able to get through.
The point the Prime Minister seemed to be aiming to make was the flow of goods will still exist, that this is not meant to cripple the economy.
But essentially what I understand, and please weigh in if you have a different understanding, is basically tourists are shut out.
If you want to come here to visit or leave Canada to visit the United States, you will no longer be able to do so. Again, I'm not exactly positive on the timeline for that.
That is a great question.
Maybe if someone's watching from the Prime Minister's office and wants to let us know, I'll take that information asap to relay it to our viewers.



**Rosemary**:

We'll take that call.
Yeah.
[laughter]



**Vassy**:

I do think it is important to note who will be -- it sounds like, for example, we had our reporter in Windsor talking about many of the health care workers or people who work over there or vice versa, will they still be able to traverse the border? it sounded to me that they would be able to and it really is a shutdown to tourists.



**Rosemary**:

and anyone who's going over there, a lot of people go for day trips to purchase things or to visit people or what have you.
David, any different understanding from your perspective? like I also wonder if you are visiting a family member.
Would that be -- I guess, I'm not sure this was to roll out like this, to be frank.
I feel like there is a lot of missing pieces to questions that people will have timeline being the primary one.



**Reporter**:

I think we can have some insight into some of the exceptions, but not all of them as to what will focus on essential travel.
Truckers who cross the border every day.
But when they did announce the denial of entry to noncanadians and non permanent residents of Canada, excluding the United States, they did single out other specific groups.
There were flight caos, for example, truck crews, cross-border marine crews and colsz-border train crews.
a lot of goods move across the border by boat or big containers.
You know, it's -- and also on trains.
So I would suspect, based on what Minister garneau and Minister blair spelled out on Monday, that you can look at those particular groups.
It is really interesting, too, in what gareth watson was just saying.
This is a life raft announcement today.
The economy is kind of sinking and these are the boats for everybody to get into for the time being.
Because te norm -- the enormity of this is not even close to being felt.
We saw pandemics with h1n1 and sars and a peak and trough and small bump back up. There's probably future waves of this potentially coming.
When we say that this package is 3% of g. D.p., jim stanford in australia right now, the former economist for the canadian autoworkers, he points out that that 3% is a little bit misleading because the $55 billion in tax deferrals is money that will have to be paid back eventually.
It does keep it in the economy for now.
If you owe money and you're a cash intensive business, you don't suddenly have to dip into your reserves and send it to bill morneau to spend, you get to keep it to keep your business afloat.
But al of this could change.
As I say, this is the start of their response.
As Vassy has been saying and we've been hearing, the big fear in government right now is what they don't know and what they can't predict.
So, they're not going to roll out the full capacity of what they can do right now and then not have anything to offer down the roads a circumstances will change, which will cause a real loss in confidence.
There is fire poer still in reserve even after these eye-popping number and widespread measures today.



**Rosemary**:

and that has been the story on the economic measures and public health measures as a ramp up as needed.
I guess the question that I certainly can't answer is, is this enough right now.
Or should it have been more significant.
I do think that the part about the 55 tax -- $55 billion of tax deferral, Vassy, is as Mr. Watson was saying, a real lesson in the importance of keeping liquidity in the economy writ large and that is something that we learned from the 2008 recession.
Ok. The finance Minister is approaching.
I'll get you both to stick around and talk to me after.
We'll listen both to bill morneau.
We understand he doesn't have an announcement necessarily today.
They are sitting that far apart and in a different room.



Good morning.



**Rosemary**:

As they're trying to show, distancing themselves at this press conference.
Let's listen in now live.



On what the Prime Minister announced this morning.
I want to begin by acknowledging the diligence of front line health care workers who are treating patients and the public health care providers who are working tirelessly to slow the spread of this disease.
This virus.
They worked extremely hard in recent times to prepare our country as we pull together.
Last week, we announced funding to make sure our provinces and our territories have everything necessary in order to protect Canadians and make sure that the federal government was doing everything that it could.
I also want to take a moment to, a knowledge the countless others who are helping us to get through a very challenging time.
Across the country, cleaners and janitors are keeping spaces clean and disinfected.
At grocery stores and at pharmacies.
People are working hard to restock shelves and manage difficult situations.
I.t. and telecom workers are making sure that our networks are functioning well as more and more Canadians work from home.
Truckers, rail workers, air cargo workers and postal workers are working to have the essential goods that we need.
We have dedication and with a sense of duty.
There are countless others who, in these difficult times, have shown immense patience and determination in making sure that Canadians have the goods and services that they need.
So I want to thank all of you for all that you're doing.
The health and safety of Canadians is our government's top priority.
We continue to urge Canadians to stay home.
and to follow the advice for medical professionals and from public health officials.
Please take all necessary precautions to protect your health.
It's not just about you.
It's about your neighbours.
It's about your colleagues.
It's about your family members.
 



**Interpreter**:

Please take all the necessary precautions to protect your health.
It's not about you.
It's about your neighbours and your colleagues and members of your family.



We all have a role to play to flatten the kufb and protect those who are most vulnerable.
We have to look out for each other.
That is what Canadians do. We need that Canadian spirit now, more than ever.
COVID-19 is having a significant impact on our economy.
An impact that continues to evolve.
At this stage, the full breadth and scope of the impact remain unknown.
I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister's leadership.
This is a challenge like none that we've ever faced before.
Facing up to it demands swift and decisive action a. a coordinated approach is absolutely necessary at this time.
I'm in contact with provincial and territorial partners, with the private sector and with My colleagues, other finance ministers from around the world.
I've also been working closely with federal colleagues, including governor pol oz from the bank of Canada who's here with me today.
Together we're working hard to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the Canadian and global economy.
Clearly the impacts have been profound and will continue to be profound.
Households and businesses are already feeling the effects.
Our government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong and stable, whatever it takes.
I want to address something off the top.
Usually My job is to ensure that we maintain our fiscal track.
But right now, as Minister of finance, My only job is to make sure that Canadians can keep food in the fridge.
That they can keep a roof over their heads.
That they can afford the medicine that they need.
As you heard me say many times before, we've entered this challenge in a very strong fiscal position.
Canada's balance sheet is the envy of the world and it means we have the fiscal fire power to respond.
We're now prepared to use it. COVID-19 is an extraordinary challenge that requires an extraordinary investment.
Today we're announcing the first phase, the first phase of Canada's COVID-19 economic response plan.
We'll provide $27 billion of direct support to people and businesses, which is more than 1% of our g. D.p. On top of this, we'll defer $55 billion in tax revenue, leaving that money in the economy.
For the economists listening, that is 3% of g. D.p. That would not be in the economy without these actions.
For all Canadians, this means we're doing whatever it takes to support you and your family as we contain this virus.




**Interpreter**:

Which represents more than 1% of g. D.p. Further more, we will be providing.
$55 billion and injecting that money into the economy.
For the economy that represents 3% of the g. D.p. That will be in action.
For Canadians, it means that we're doing everything necessary to support you as the virus continues.



We're working quickly to get money into people's hands so that no matter what happens during this period, they can afford the essentials and we're working to make sure that no one gets left behind.
First and foremost, we know that people are worried about their health.
So if you're needing to quarantine or self-isolate or care for a loved one who's sick, you can get around $450 per week.
Even if you don't qualify for employment insurance.
The new what we're calling emergency care benefit will provide self-employed canadian, contractors, freelancers, part-time workers, gig economy workers, many of our cultural workers and more with income security if they can't work because they're in self-isolation or in quarantine or taking care of a loved one.
This benefit will provide income support of $900 every two weeks for up to 15 weeks.




**Interpreter**:

The new emergency care benefit will allow self-employed workers, entrepreneurs, part-time workers and others income security if they cannot work because they are in quarantine or isolation or because they're caring for a member of their family.
This will provide some $900 every two weeks for a period of 15 weeks.



Unable to work because schools and day cares are closed, or if you knead to take care of a sick family member, you'll also qualify for the emergency care benefit.
Canadians can apply online at home, awe -allowing them to follow public health guidelines.
It will require a simple simple medical documentation.
We want this to be as easy as possible so people who need this help can get this help.
The benefit will be available starting in early April.
This is about saving lives.
No Canadian will have to worry about protecting their health and putting food on the table.
This new measure builds on the announcement the Prime Minister made last week that we're waving the one-week waiting period to access the employment insurance sickness benefits for people who are sick or in quarantine.
We also know that people are worried about struggling to pay the bills if they lose their jobs or see their hours reduced.
Wi want you to know that we have your back.
For any worker who loses their job and does not qualify for employment insurance, we'll be introducing a new benefit -- the emergency support benefit.
For which we set aside $5 billion.
More details will come in the near future, but you can rest assured that the federal government will provide you with 14 weeks of support at a comparable level to the employment insurance programme.
There are also over 1 million canadian families with low and modest incomes who will need extra financial support at this time.
The government will provide a g. S.t. Credit averaging close to $400 for single adults and $600 for couples to see you through.
and help families keep their kids well-fed and provided for, the government will issue a special Canada child benefit.
a top up of $300 per child.
For a single parent with two children, earning minimum wage, these two measures combined will mean around $1500 of special support.




**Interpreter**:

At a comparable level to employment insurance.
Over 12 million low and modest-income families in Canada need financial support.
The government will thus provide a g. S.t. Top-up of some $400 for lone adults and close to $600 for couples.
and to help families look after their children, the government will provide a Canada child benefit top-up of some $300 per child.
For a lone parent with two children who earns minimum wage, these two combined measures will represent some 1500 of support.



You know seniors are worried, too.
First and foremost, please take care of your health.
Practice social distancing.
and make sure you're listening to medical advice.
We also know you're concerned about the impact of recent market volatility on your retirement funds.
We will help you protect the value of your retire.
Fund by temporarily reducing the minimum withdrawal on registered retirement income funds by 25%. we'll continue to monitor this issue as markets evolve.
and I want to assure you that your o. a.s. and g. I.s. Payments will continue as usual, without any interruption.
Many young Canadians starring in and outs their careers are worried about what this uncertainty will mean to their finances.
We're putting in place a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada student loan paybacks.
This means nearly one million Canadians will have an extra $160 a month during this period.
We know that indigenous community face a greater risk of financial insecurity so we're creating a distinctions-based indigenous community support fund.
It's crucial that we support our most vulnerable at this time.
That, of course, has to include shelters.
Shelters across the country will need the tools to prevent outbreaks.
We'll invest over $200 million to support the homeless through homeless shelters, sexual assault centres and shelters for women and children to help with the purchase of necessary equipment, to implement the best medical advice for keeping people safe and healthy.




**Interpreter**:

Across the country, shelters will need resources to prevent outbreaks.
We'll invest close to $200 million to support shelters for the homeless, sexual assault centres and halfway homes and transition homes for women and children so that they can do everything that they can to put in place the best medical advice to ensure the health and safety of Canadians.



We need businesses to keep going so they can keep employees on staff.
I know many small and medium-sized businesses and organisations are very concerned about their ability to keep paying their workers.
For small employers, we will provide a 10% wage subsidy for the next three months up to $25, 000 per employer.
This is effective immediately and will help keep Canadians employed.




**Interpreter**:

I know that many medium and small sized businesses are concerned about the ability to continue to pay their workers.
For small businesses and organisations, we will provide a wage subsidy of 10% for the next three months up to an announcement of $25, 000 per employer.
This will come into force immediately and this will help keep Canadians at work.



Steps taken last week to enhance the work sharing programme, which will help workers facing reduced hours to get by and help businesses and employers in these difficult times.
We also announced business credit availability programme which will provide $10 billion in credit support through the business development bank of Canada and export development Canada to help businesses and organisations get the financing they need to keep operating and keep their employees on. We're prepared to provide additional financial support as necessary.
On Friday, the office of the superintendent of financial institutions took about to sing free up $300 billion in lending capacity.
The bank of Canada, the governor of the bank of Canada also announced a rate cut of 50 basis points to stabilize our economy.
We know that businesses in some sectors are more affected than others like air transportation.
and the oil and gas sector.
and we know that they will need specific help.
E.d. C. and b. B.c. Are currently developing a tailored set ofle toos fol them and other affected sectors.
At the same time, the federal government will begin working with the government of Alberta.
We'll make a significant investment in orphan well remediation to help both companies and workers in the province.
and we'll be ready to make an announcement on this in the coming days.
Canadians are also worried -- of course -- about bills that are coming due.
On Monday, the Canada mortgage housing corporation reinstated the insured mortgage protection programme.
Through this programme, the corporation will offer $50 million so that banks and mortgage lenders can offer Canadians payment deferrals, special payment arrangements or other options to assist home owners through this time.
Compounded with other liquidity tools that we mentioned, this will mean that there is now $500 billion in credit available to canadian businesses and households.
I've talked to the heads of Canada's largest banks and they've commited to provide additional flexibility in the face of hardshipsful as a first step, the support will include up to a six-month deferral programme for mortgages and specific opportunities for relief on other credit products like skip a payment on autoloans or on credit cards.
For banks have a long history of standing by Canadians through challenge times.
I encourage Canadians to contact your bank directly, to discuss your situation and to get the help that you need.




**Interpreter**:

[inaudible] a. and have encouraged them to work with businesses and individuals, to find practical solutions given this context.
First, this support will allow for a six-month deferral for mortgage loans and the possibility of easing credit.
Our banks have always supported Canadians throughout difficult times and I would encourage Canadians to communicate directly with their banks to discuss their situations and to obtain the support that you need.



Personal income taxes and Canadian businesses who owe corporate income tax now only need to pay it before September 1. This frees up $55 billion in temporary tax relief.
and it keeps that money circulating in our economy.
We know this is a time when individuals and businesses need to have money at hand and also, given the extraordinary times, we've extended the tax filing deadline until June 1. 



**Interpreter**:

Canadians who have [inaudible] will not have to pay until September 1. That frees up $55 million of tax relief and allows this money to circulate freely in our economy.
We know that this is a time when individuals and businesses need readily available money.
Further more, given these extraordinary times, we have extended the deadline for filing tax returns until June 1.



With labour and other leaders across Canada.
On Monday, I spoke to all of the c. E.o. S of our major grocery stores.
They told me that their supply chains are still working.
Working well.
and they committed to me that during this crisis they will maintain fair prices for their customers.
As a reminder to Canadians, when you are out shopping, please make sure that you're leaving goods on the shelves, for your neighbours that might be waiting for a cheque to come before they can buy the things that they need.
We all need to pull together and do our part during this time.
As your Minister of finance, I will do whatever it takes.
In order to follow through on these commitments we'll be tabling emergency legislation to provide timely support to Canadians as well as to ensure that we have all the tools to support them and businesses as things continue to evolve during these very uncertain times.
It's our collective responsibility to ensure that we continue to have the tools to respond quickly as things evolve.
These tools will be essential to give Canadians the certainty that their government can rapidly implement measures to protect them and to protect our economy.
I'm calling on all parties in the senate to work with us and to support this legislation.
There can be no delay.
But I also want to say that I'm confident that all parliamentarians will rise to this occasion.
Canadians are count on us. I want to turn over now to governor poloz for a moment before I make some closing remarks.



Bonjour.
 Canadians expect their policymakers to do what it takes to support them in this difficult period.
The circumstances we face today require all hands on deck.
Each institution is acting within its respective mandate to deliver a powerful confidence-boosting package of measures for consumers, business and a financial markets.
For its part, the bank of Canada has been working hard to ensure that the financial system has sufficient liquidity so that credit continues to be available to businesses and to households.
To recap briefly, on Monday, the bank has adjust to maintain credit availability.
The bank has broadened eligible collateral for its term repo facility to help maintain funding conditions by providing a backstop to regular private funding.
Those will complement the reduction in bank capital buffers announced last week by the office of superintendent of financial institutions.
All these actions will support lending by banks to consumers and companies.
The bank is also providing extra support to the Canada mortgage bond market so this important funding market continues to function well.
The first purchase under this new programme took place only yesterday.
To help the economy cope with the negative shocks of COVID-19 and the recent sharp drop in oil prices, the bank has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points and two steps.
The first was on March 4, second time just this past Friday.
Our benchmark interest rate right now stands at .75%. the bank has also broadened the scope of the government of Canada bond buyback programme and repo operations and introduce add new bankers acceptance purchase facility that starts next Monday, March 23rd.
In the days to come t bank will launch its new standing term liquidity facility.
This new funding mechanism is focused on individual institutions rather than on the market as a whole.
It's intended to give an eligible institution that is viable but facing a a sudden stress to its liquidity access to central bank lick -- liquidity on terms known in advance.
We hope they will make use of this new facility.
Canadian banks also conduct parts of their business in United States dollars.
and on the weekend, the bank of Canada joined with its counterparts in the United States, japan, europe, the United States and switzerland on a coordinated action to provide liquidity via standing United States dollar liquidity swap arrangements.



**Interpreter**:

The bank of Canada is taking concerted actions to support the economy in this time of economic stress.
We have introduced these new measures and we are monitoring how the markets are improving.
We're also closely monitoring market trends and prepared to provide all the liquidity that the financial system requires so that it can continue to serve Canadians.



Concerted action to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress.
We have introduced these new measures and watching how market performance improves.
We're closely monitoring market developments and stand ready to provide all liquidity the financial system needs so it can continue to serve Canadians.
Finance Minister, back to you.



Thank you.
Earlier I noted that many of the heroes of the situation, the people providing medical care we need, food to eat, working phones and internet, clean spaces.
Let's make sure that we give them the support that they need.
Journalists are also doing extraordinary work to keep Canadians informed in this rapidly changing situation.
I do know the work of governor poloz, My colleagues, especially the Prime Minister who's reacted to this undress den ed situation with strong leadership, compassion and focus on taking concrete actions to help Canadians.
There are, though, still many things that we do not know.
But we do know one thing.
and that is that together we will get through this challenge.




**Interpreter**:

When the time comes, we will ensure more longer term investments to help Canadians, to get their daily life back.
But what is the most important thing today is that we take care of each other.
and that we protect the most vulnerable among us and we continue to use all the tools available to stabilize our economy.
The government will be there.



When the time is right, we will announce more long-term investments to assist with recovery and help Canadians get back to their daily lives.
But what matters most today is that we look after each other.
That we protect those who are most vulnerable and that we continue to use all of the tools we have to stabilize our economy.
The government will be there with you every step along the way.
Thank you and I'm happy to take questions from the journalists here.



[inaudible].



**Reporter**:

Kelly Johnson with Reuters.
Governor poloz, first question to you.
The federal reserve over the weekend cut by 100 basis points to essentially make rate 0. Why is the bank of Canada not matching the federal reserve's rate cut at this point?



Well, as is always the case, we have independent monetary policies on the two sides of border.
We were anxious to see the details of the fiscal policy that was just announced for you.
We will be taking those actions fully into account in terms of how the Thai will fare.
I will say that one of the most desirable features of these actions today are what I would call elastic.
I hope you don't mind, Minister, if I coin a phrase.
But I -- what I think they're designed to do is to expand or not, the pen ting on how large of an impact there is on the economy.
How many people are affected? and so that is a very desirable feature and that is something we need to model in. We're updating our forecast as we speak.
Bank staff are fully engaged.
Even though they're working from home.
Our systems are functioning very well and 1500 people are on their -- logged on our system remotely.
So April 15, our next announcement date.
So I'd like to have the full benefit of analysis, especially as I said, incorporating the fiscal responses into that analysis.
So, for now, that is what I'll say about interest rates.



You mentioned that EDC is working on specific packages for industries that will be particularly hard hit, like airlines.
Can you give a bit more detail as to what that package might look like, how long it may take to get that package in place because, as you mentioned, there are significant industries that are in a crisis point at this point.



Let me step to the broader concern we have to support businesses at this time.
Obviously we're concerned that people stay at their jobs as they are able to do that with their employer.
For that reason, we want to make sure that we're supporting companies through this challenging time.
The first place we've done that, obviously, has been through providing loan opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses through the business credit availability programme.
That is very important.
What we're doing today is we're giving temporary wage subsidies to businesses so they can keep people on board and what we know we need to do in the very immediate timeframe is to work with businesses that are impacted sectors.
I've already been working with businesses in the airline sector.
Spoke to two of the c. E.o. S last evening.
We have a team working with businesses in the oil and gas sector.
We recognize that ensuring that we bridge these businesses through this difficult time is critically important.
That is what we're working towards.
We'll have more work to do with these businesses, to listen to their challenges and understand how we can create that support as needed.
That is coming shortly as we work with them toward that goal.



Thank you.
Just if for interest of fairness, let's keep it to one question and one follow-up. Yes.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

I don't see anything for independent workers for the directive to stay at home but don't necessarily have any childrens, who are not necessarily ill.
is there something in your plan for that? and if not, what do you plan to do about that? answer -- we want to ensure that people who wish to stay home, we want to ensure that they will have the support necessary for that.
. that means that our emergency support benefit programme will be there for them if they wish to -- if they must be at home with no source of income.
If they're in a situation where they don't have enough money.
So there will be this emergency support benefit programme that will be there for those people if they must be at home and the details will be coming up in the next day.
Thank you.
I've hear that the unemployment rate may reach 20%. have you done any estimates with regard to what is coming in that regard? answer -- we know that with today's challenges, the challenges in the coming weeks and months, there will be difficult ties for many businesses throughout the country and, therefore, we need a support that protects people who are in this situation.
Today, we cannot put any forecast in place because the situation is ever changing.
That being said, we have an approach, as the governor said, an approach that will be as broad as possible.
If there are challenges for people, they will receive the support that they need for them and their families.
Thank you.



Minister, I was curious about your indigenous community's funding.
Can you please explain some examples about what that's actually supposed to be used for? what that looks like.
and how is it going to be broken down among first nations, Inuit and mÉtis in is that by number of people in each population or need?



First of all, let me say that what we're trying to do in this time, we're trying to make sure that the people that are impacted, that are directly impacted by this virus, those who want to stay at home because they need to isolate or we've asked to isolate or those who lose their jobs are the support that they need.
We also recognize that there are groups of Canadians that are particularly vulnerable and people that are in places that are far away from medical care, people who are in places where food security is a challenge are particularly impacted.
We recognize that indigenous and northern communities are in that category.
We are moving fast in this regard, to try and make sure that we've allocated the resources necessary.
We recognize that there will be, in case like supporting indigenous and northern communities, there will be details that we need to continue to work out.
We need to recognize that we don't know all the situations so far.
and that we need to prepare ourselves for those eventualities.
That's what we're doing in the case of indigenous peoples and we're looking forward to working together very rapidly to figure out the details that really constitute your question.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible]. would that be correct?



I think you should not make any assumptions at this stage.
We'll be very clear and transparent with Canadians about what we know and what we don't know.
What we're clear today is that we're providing support for people that we know are impacted.
What we're going to continue to do is support Canadians through a difficult time.
and as situations evolve and develop, we will be there for Canadians.
Canadians in all different situationsful and that is what we're reflecting today in our approach and the goal we have is to make sure that we have the right resources at the right time for the challenges we're facing.
Right now we're facing a situation where Canadians need to know that they have access to medical care, they need to know they have access to food and the essentials that they require.
There will be a next phase where we might continue to need to support people and make investments to ensure that we can actually come out of this challenge.
So, there will be more to come.



Thank you.
So we'll go to the phone.
Julianna?



You may press star 1 to ask a question.
Your line is open.
Please go ahead.



**Caller**:

Hi, ministerment you mentioned you are working with the oil and gas sector and there might be something from [inaudible] coming.
But what about governments in oil-producing provincessome you've been in talks about fiscal stabilization measures.
We know newfoundland is in particular fiscal problems.
So, where are you at in terms of action in response to demands from oil producing provinces?



Well.
Thank you for the question.
We know that there are going to be things emerged through this challenge that are unpredictable.
But some things are seen right off.
There will be challenges in Alberta because of the significant impact not only of this virus, but also the impact of the oil prices we're seeing around the world.
That will also have impacts on the province of Newfoundland and Labrador as mentioned.
We'll work through these challenges individually with provinces as they emerge and recognizing what we want is to come out of this challenge.
This is a temporary challenge.
a difficult issue for us. But a temporary challenge.
One we need to come out of strong and that is going to be our approach.
We will work with province as they come to us with their issues in a way that is protecting citizens of each part of our country and ensuring we have the capacity to move forward once we're through this issue.



Do you have a follow-up, sir?



**Reporter**:

Yes.
The Canadian federation of independent business, their reaction is questioning why the support is at 10% when other countries like Denmark are at 75%. and for the governor, if he could weigh in as well, you mentioned the next rate announcement is April 15. What would it take for you to move before that scheduled announcement?



Let me just address the approach we eve taken today.
We want to make sure that people have access to financial resources in a time of real need.
We know that people are concerned about having access to enough money for essentials.
For medicines, for health care, for any form of food or lodging.
These are critically important and so we focused our approach on having enough money delivered at the right time so people can actually deal with the issues that they're facing.
We know that businesses need asupport.
We've taken an approach that allows for support for businesses right now through a temporary wage subsidy and significant support for businesses as they seek to have credit through a difficult time.
We won't take anything off the table.
We'll continue to rise to these challenges and respond in a way that meets the goals we're all trying to achieve.
and they need to come out of this strong so we can revive our economy at the appropriate time.



Thank you.
Next person.



Thank you.
The next question, please.



**Reporter**:

Hello.
My question is for Minister poloz.
What additional measures is the bank considering to bolster the economy and is quantitative easing among them?



Well, thank you.
and let me just answer bill's question, bill curry's question just before I turn to yours.
Because they are contextual.
So, you know, I was fairly careful to not rule out actions at any time.
Was nothing scripted about the bank's posture.
We will be doing our usually analysis and producing a monetary policy report.
Bank staff are hard on that.
One of the big changes that we have to incorporate in that is this major fiscal announcement that we've just seen.
It's -- you know, I'm not going to itemize what could cause us to move earlier or not move earlier at this stage.
What I think, and coming -- blending that with the next question, we've made a lot of moves in just a few days, as I item I aed.
-- itemized.
and just to give you an illustration, I know it sounds theoretical for people, oh, we have a different Rep programme or different lats ral.
To illustrate what that might mean.
Just yesterday, the bank did about just under $35 billion of unusual or quite exceptional transactions and that is across a wide range of programmes.
Some of which we had never done before.
I'm proud of the trading room folks that are getting these things done at a time especially when we split our operations into three different locations for health and safety reasons.
and everything is functioning terrifically.
I'm knocking on wood there.
For example, we did our first purchase in the secondary mortgage bonds yesterday.
Spreads in Canada mortgage bonds have come down from in the almost 70 basis points to around 50 basis points.
These are on 10 years and that is a really significant move in the markets and it is an indicator that that action is helping to ease tensions out there.
and this is all aimed at keeping credit channels open so that, you know, out there, businesses and households have lines of credit with banks and what we want to make sure is that the system functions well so the banks are still in a position to continue to offer that credit to people when they actually need it. Which is in a situation like this.
So that back plumbing sort of action that we're taking is very important and some of these things are just getting under way.
So I think it is important for us to take some time here to watch those things unfold and see how the market functions.
What other tools do? -- do we have? they are the same ones we laid out in the past under extraordinary measures.
They are also in a tool kit.
I think the main thing is that most of these things are scaled.
Or scalable.
So we sort of started out with a certain number of, as I said, for example $35 billion yesterday.
That's a lot.
For one day worth of transactions.
But we'll scale that as needed.
Whatever the system needs.
This is what we'll provide.
and we'll continue to evolve perhaps elements of the programmes to make them more tailored, if need be. For now, we have a lot in place and we want to see how it functions.
It seems to be functioning well so far.



Follow-up?



I take it that means you're not ruling out quantitative easing.



I would certainly not rule out quantitative easing.
Of course not.
and that -- that is just something that's a standard part of the central bank tool kit.
I would say that the things that we're doing right now, that is activically operating in various bond markets and we're just about to start next week, are -- are bankers acceptance programme.
Those things may appear to you as a sort of quantitative easing.
But they are not.
They are just intended to help markets discover prices more readily when the bond market is dysfunctional, people continue -- they get spreads and the market freezes up. So, by doing switches and buybacks, the bank can show itself and show guidance so we get more rapid turnover in the market.
So all those things are going hand in hand to make sure -- I feel like the plumbing is working well.
and that means that the rest of the delivery system that is going on can do its job.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Minister more know.
I want to know what kind of assistance are you looking at for the airlines and for the oil and gas sector.
Would this be part of the $10 billion liquidity measures announced last week or would they provide a different kind of assistance? are you different thank you.
We're going to work with organisations in the oil and gas sector and the airline sector in order to come up with approaches that enable them to bridge through a challenging time.
That is critical.
We're not far enough along in those discussions to identify specific measures that we will take.
But we do recognize the urgency of those discussions and are proceeding with that in mind.



and your follow-up? no. Ok.in that case, we'll go back to the room.



**Interpreter**:

is there anything specific for the seniors, for example would there be any changes to o. a.s. Rapidly? what about [inaudible] the particularly vulnerable? thank you.
We know that there are challenges for all Canadians across the country.
Of course, the challenge is more difficult for people who are in a position where they receive less income because of COVID-19. We want to it a sure that our approach is continuing so seniors can rest assure that they will keep the income that they're receiving but we have particular challenge.
Challenges.
For example, with the change in market prices, there are difficulties for some seniors and that is why we have introduced an approach that will help people who want to rest assure that they can continue when they receive their income in future.
So we are trying to monitor the situation.
If there is something that is required, then we'll step up. You've talked about an easing of rules in order to receive e. I. benefits.
and there are also people who have called for an enhancement of these benefits.
Why are you choosing not go in that direction? answer -- the most important thing immediately is that we have to keep in mind people who are not part -- who do not qualify for e. Ism benefits, even if they're having problems and that is why we're considering how we can ensure that the $5.7 million of the -- of our 19 million workers are going to receive something.
That is very important.
But we have also done things to help a vast majority of Canadians.
Our credit approach with the g. S.t. is going to help some 15 million Canadians and we've also got this enhanced c. C.c. Benefit that will help 3.4 million companies across Canada.
So, we have specific measures for a large number of Canadians.
and all together this is a very comprehensive approach for people who are in the situations where they may not be receiving sufficient income.
Thank you.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] for Canadians to get money in their pockets?



We've worked hard to make sure that the approach's that we're taking will enable us to move forward as rapidly as possible.
This has been a key area of focus, certainly the Prime Minister has been very engaged in this discussion with me. We've looked at both the systems that we currently have in government, like the employment insurance system, and the systems that we have that can enable us to get money out quickly.
It is why we've come to the measures that we've come to because they enable us to get money out rapidly.
So, we'll be working through the Canada revenue agency, primarily, for the g. S.t. Credit that will enable us to get that out fairly rapidly, we believe, in April for the approach.
The emergency benefits that we've talked about, those benefits will be out within a couple to three weeks.
Very rapidly.
We're putting up an automatic system so people can go online to the C.R.A. So people can apply with a very, very modest approach to showing that they have the appropriate situation.
and that we think will enable people to get money in their family finances very rapidly.



Are you concerned about the optics of closing the United States-canadian border to nonessential travel, that it may lead to consumers, panicked shopping or, you know, hoarding groceries more or other supplis? how do you combat that? and as well, can the cross-border supply chain, is it resilient enough to maintain that kind of shock for an extented period of time?



We've been working hard with the United States administration in recent days to make sure we come up with an approach that ensures we can continue to have the goods and the things that we need, the essential medicines, the food come back and forth across our border, that our broader supply chains can continue.
We want that to be able to maintain our economy now and to allow us to get back to where we want to get back to once we're past this crisis.
I think what we've come to is a very good conclusion that we will enable nonessential workers and travelers, those people will not be able to cross the border.
But essential workers.
People that might be working in Windsor from Detroit or people working in Detroit that are from Windsor.
They will be able to go back and forth if they're in the health care sector.
We'll be able to ensure that goods and services can come back and forth because our economy will need that travel.
That was an important discussion between the Prime Minister and the president.
We're confident that will give Canadians confidence, that we'll continue to have what we need and we'll be continuing to work together in a cooperative way as we country our best to deal with everything as it comes up. and that is the approach we've taken and will continue to take.



**Reporter**:

Molly Thomas from CTV national news.
You said your focus is for Canadians to keep food in the fridge and a roof over their heads.
We know that banks are deferring mortgage payments.
What about people who don't own a home? what about people struggling to pay nrenlt this time? wham are doing for them?



That is particularly important.
There is many different situations for as many different Canadians as economist and we're trying to ensure that we deal with the most urgent and important right upfront and that is why those 5.7 million people in the insurance system, they are important so if they're sick or quarantined and laid off and can't work and, therefore, aren't getting paid, they'll have access to funds.
The g. S.t. Income credit which will be providing a significant amount of support for lower-income Canadians, it is a benefit that provides everyone with a family income up to $56, 000 with support.
That will help as well.
So we are doing our best to make sure that we get the funds to the people who need it most on an urgent basis and we believe that's the right way to deal with this challenge and we'll continue to think about other methods to get money to people.
But we believe these are the fastest way to get the appropriate amount of funds to the people most in need.



**Reporter**:

Are we looking at a worse financial quarter to come? then after that and maybe governor pol oz can also weigh in on that.



I think it is important that we tell Canadians what we know and what we don't know.
We can't know the full impact or the duration of the challenge we're facing.
We do have one of the strongest, the not the strongest health care system in the world to deal with this crisis.
We know that we perhaps have the best banking system in the world to make sure that businesses can still get credit.
We have a very strong fiscal position that we're willing to use.
So, we know that we've got the tools to deal with this.
We also know we have a strong and well-educated workforce to come out of this when the time comes and will support people along the way to get there.
As we know more, we will be telling Canadians exactly what we know and we will be supporting them with measures that are appropriate to the challenges that we come up against.
That is what we'll do today and quonlt that approach.



So -- sorry.
I think the Minister said, we honestly don't know what's coming our way.
The fact is, back then, we didn't know what was coming our way either.
But I would say that one thing you mentioned that is worth emphasizing is we do have the best banking system in the world.
and it is, indeed, vastly strengthened compared to 12 years ago because of new global standards and I think also lessons that were learned during that period.
and those lessons were learned not just by the lenders but they were learned by the policymakers.
So personally, I have great comfort from the seasoned people who I have around me who were living through that at the time I was making loans at EDC But -- but, for example, Carolyn Wilkins was in the trench developing new capital arrangements, new collateral arrangements, new lines to help the situation under governor Carney and there she is today doing exactly the same thing behind the scenes.
That sort of thing gives me a lot of confidence that, in fact, we are in a better position today in the financial system.
and we're ahead in terms of deployment of those tools compared to back in 2008.
Gej, -- again, I put that up against we don't know what's coming o you are way, of course.
But I think we have the ability to be nimble and adaptable to it. and this fiscal package is going to make a really big difference to the way you envision how that would play out.
I think the other thing we weren't prepared for the other side.
We know that this is a temporary thing.
We don't know how long or how big.
But it is temporary and Ina we enter this at a time when the economy was in the best place it had been for a really long time, with unemployment at historic lows and inflation on target and so on and a strong fiscal position.
All those things make a really big difference to how we will recover afterwards.
So I think we can certainly look forward to a robust recovery when the stroubl behind us. -- trouble is behind us.



We'll go back to the phone.
In the interest of time, we'll only take two questions on the phone and two questions in audience.
Julian I can't? julianna?



The next question is from the "wall street journal". your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Hi, thanks.
This question is for governor poloz.
Governor, I'm wondering if you could describe how governing council is communicating at this stage.
It seems that your communications have moved to a different format and how often you're meeting and when the last meeting was.



Ok. We're in pretty constant touch.
We met yesterday.
We are -- we met, though, mostly virtually.
For certain senior deputy Wilkins and I are maintaining our distance, should either one of us become ill, that we don't affect the other.
One of our deputy governors went home and stayed home last week and a second one who lives in Vancouver is staying home.
So, we're completely -- there is only, at most, a couple of deputy governors in the building at any one time.
and the buildings won't stay empty except for the operational staff I mentioned before anyway.
So we're meeting more or less continuously on virtual -- the sky ping is working extraordinarily well.
My compliments to bell Canada.
I was on the phone all day yesterday and only once did I fail to get a call through.
I went to My land line and it worked right away so the system must be taking a terrific amount of traffic in this situation.
So all that to say, we're in constant touch and in frequent touch with our g-7 colleagues and we're meeting twice a week with the big six c. E.o. S of the large banks.
To get a feel for that.
Of course, our market intelligence people are in constant contact with the street and, of course, our operational people are in the market every minute.
So we're getting a constant play by play globally and domestically.
It's, I would say n that sense, operationally it's working extraordinarily well.
So let's just look forward as I said before to how all these things that we're doing that are different from before, how they play out.
Fundamentalty ahs o*b our financial system having access to funding and getting things to keep working out through the system.
People need it. They get it. Thank you.



**Reporter**:

Thanks.
and can I ask during the discussions, did you discuss the possibility of a rate cut today?



I don't want to front-run -- our discussions at this stage are a continuous dialogue.
It's not like we're saying let's talk about this on Friday or on Monday or that sort of thing.
We're just talking continuously.
We are developing these new tools.
We're commenting to one another, what have we forgoten, what haven't we done? so right now, you know, we'll just be in touch all the time and we will be able to say conditions have changed enough that we perhaps should have a conversation about this.
I won't need to organize a formal meeting.
Everybody is available.
For one thing, nobody is traveling anywhere.
So it is actually more available than usual.



Thank you.
Next question.



**Reporter**:

Oui.
Bonjour.




**Interpreter**:

Good afternoon.
I have a question for Mr. Morneau.
If we look at the details of emergency care benefit, people have to prove every two weeks that they're still eligible.
I was wondering why they don't -- or why -- or are you considering easing those options? because some people may have difficulty contacting C.R.A. So, perhaps some emergency aid should be dispensed.
Thank you.
Have.
We wish to have an approach that works very nimbly.
We think that we have found the right approach, which means that there will be a very short attestation to ensure that the person in question is, indeed, in a situation where they require income.
and then we will have an automatic with the C.R.A. There will be an automatic payment so that they can receive the payment immediately.
So this is an approach that we think will work if there are challenges because, while it is the first time we've used such an approach, we will rectify it as soon as possible.
So, we will be there for Canadians.
We will be there as quickly as possible with the tools required.
Thank you.
My follow-up question is, well most of the measures announced today are direct support.
This will require adoption by parliament and royal ascent.
What is going to happen to ensure that this is going to happen as quickly as possible? what is your message? answer -- I'd like to tell the other political parties, I'd like to say that they are working very closely with the government.
and a we have received a number of recommendations and, in My opinion, we all realise that we need an approach that is going to be in place as quickly as possible and, in My opinion, we will be back to parliament very, very quickly.
Thank you.



Thank you.
and we're coming back to the room.
Sir?



**Reporter**:

Governor, I'm looking for a figure.
On purchase of banker's acceptance notes, municipal and corporate bonds, what is the ceiling?



We have not laid out our programme terse around that yet.
But it will be judged according to need, Ok. our objective will be market functioning and so if the market needs only a small amount of activity from us to function well, then it will be a small amount.
We'll start off with pretty large numbers and a question of what take-up there is. It's like a reverse auction and you say we're willing to take up to this much and see what the response is. So it's more like what does the market require in order to get through its business week.
So that is to begin next week.
I mean, I hesitate to used extreme words around this.
But just say all of these things are done around repos and other forms of lending or involvement in the actual secondary markets.
We can scale those up as much as needed.
There is all kinds of capacity to make them as big as seems to be needed at the time.
We don't have to worry about.
People are asking, is there more you can do? yeah, you can do everything bigger one week and not as big the next.
It just depents on what the market requires.



**Reporter**:

Minister, you've been told by fib that businesses will be failing, but the carbon tax goes up at the start of the fiscal year.
You've been told by fib that people will be losing their jobs but M.P.s will be getting a cost of living increase on April 1. Carbon tax, cost of living increase.
Will you defer those or repeal them on April 1 to set an example?



I think it's important to note that we've -- you know, we've been working together with the other parties.
I've asked the president of the Canadian labour congress and the president of the Canadian chamber of congress, both here with us today.
We've been working together with lake and with business to work on an approach that is going to deliver the support that Canadians need right now.
and by that I mean the support that people need to deal with this immediate challenge so we've had recommendations from both the theyian labour congress and Canadian chamber on approaches we can take to deal with both, how we support people and how we support businesses through a very challenging time.
We have embraced the changes that we recommended because we've seen them as being very sensible approaches.
Things that we can implement rapidly.
We've also taken and embraced the approaches proposed by the other parties.
I think there's been a good level of collaboration and understanding that we knead to deal with the challenges in the immediate term that are right here in front of us and we need to ensure that we get to the challenges that will be the next set of challenges when those present themselves.
That is why I'm pleased with where we've gotten to. But I'm -- we'll have to acknowledge that we will remain open on what the next steps somebody should the situation evolve.
Our wall streeting is elastic.
If we find we have more people with challenges, we are taking the measures that mean that people can have access to money, irrespective of how long that goes because we are going to have to reconsider the information as it comes out.
and that is going to be quite important for dealing with this challenge.
I want Canadians to know that we'll continue to support them, that in a challenging time, the government will be there for them.



Thank you.
and for our last question, TVA.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

You are saying that there is a great deal of legislative work.
You are talking three weeks for the emergency care benefit.
How long will they take? answer, we have already begun our approach with regard to administration.
This means over the past weeks we have been working to ensure that we have the facility and capacity to pay the money out to people and that is very important.
We have to have the legislation, obviously, that must be adopted and that is why it's important to work with other parties and, in My opinion, we'll be in a very good position to do so in coming days.
So we have an approach.
We have the possibility of taking robust measures and we're going to be very transparent with Canadians to ensure every day to monitor where we're at and to ensure that Canadians can have the trust, can trust us to receive with them the income that they require to meet their needs.
Question inaudible for the interpreter.
Answer -- well, if we can do it before three weeks, we will do so. If we need to take the full three weeks, we will.
But please rest assured that we're working every single day to find ways of administering what we're doing as possible.
How do you evaluate the cost of changes at the border.
For example, will supply chains continue to work? how much is it going to cost all of the complications at the United States border.
There will be problems.
Our approach and concern to the United States border is to ensure that we make our -- make Canadians' health a priority and to ensure that our health care system works.
I think that we found the right approach.
We are going to continue with essential circulation, but we're going to tell Canadians and Americans that they must stay at home except in case of nonessential travel.
With regard to our economy, our approach is that we want to continue free trade between ourselves and the United States.
We cannot be sure, right at the moment, at what will happen in the future.
Because things are changing every day.
But we do have an agreement with the Americans that will ensure that we can continue to engage in free trade, which is very important for our economy.
Thank you.



We believe what we've come up with the Americans is the appropriate approach.
We said we don't want to have nonessential travel back and forth.
So consistent with both countries, we asked people to stay at home.
If they can stay at home, if they're not essential workers.
That said, we'll allow essential workers to go back and forth.
We will allow for commerce to continue because we know that getting medicine, getting food back and forth across the border is critically important for both countries and so we've taken a practical approach that will protect us and ensure that we continue to be able to have a functioning economy during this challenging time.
With that, I'd like to thank all of you and just to say that what we tried to do today is to ensure that Canadians have confidence, that Canadians have confidence that we are going to protect them and their families, not only their health, but their ability to afford the things that they need at the time they need it. This is a significant phase of helping people directly, of helping businesses to bridge a difficult time.
But there will be more work to do as we learn more information.
I've been particularly pleased with the cooperation of the other parties.
It is clear that we all see the importance of working together to support Canadians and I'm confident that we'll be able to continue to work together in that regard.
I've been pleased to see the Canadian labour congress and Canadian chambers of commerce to work together to come up with ideas that are supporting Canadians, supporting Canadian businesses so they can support people.
This is the sort of thing that we have in Canada that is so -- that we're so fortunate to have.
We'll continue to take care of Canadians.
We ask that people take care of themselves and the government will be there to support them as we move forward in these challenging times.
So Merci.beaucoup.
We'll look forward to continuing to keep you up to date as the situation evolves.
Thank you, governor.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is a very long press conference from the finance Minister and governor of the bank of Canada.
One of the central pieces of information is that this injection of cash that will be coming directly to your pockets soon and a freeing up of liquidity is only the first step is what the finance Minister said in terms of long-term investments to help with the economy and subsequent recovery.
The governor of the bank of Canada I thought really nailed the description by saying that these measures are, quote, elastic.
That they're designed to expand or not depending on the circumstances.
We can understand $27 billion in direct payments now, $55 billion in deferred tax payments until the end of augustful but don't think that there isn't the capacity and ability to do more and to go bigger f needed.
and if Canadians need it. I believe we're standing by now for a press conference with a handful of ministers again and Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Teresa tam.
Let me bring in My colleagues Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane who have both been listening closely.
It was very, very detailed and trying to get a very broad picture of the state of things.
I think on both counts.
There was a little bit more information about how the money will be send to Canadians, how much money will be sent.
Although it is not going to happen overnight.



**Vassy**:

No, it is not going to happen overnight and sounds like the best-case scenario is within three weeks, especially for -- and we've been speaking about this all morning -- but those people who have to stay home or have to take sick leave and are not normally qualified to obtain e. I. so they wouldn't normally qualify for that programme.
But the government has introduced today two separate programmes which they can qualify for.
But it sounds like it will take a bit of time to get that going and I think My colleague david, our colleague david, flagged that earlier.
The administration of all of this is really where the ball is going, where we have to pay attention now.
Are they able to get this money out the door and if they are, how quickly can they? it is a lot of money.
You know, $27 billion when you add up all the various programmes.
and it is through programmes that already exist to a degree.
But these new ones that they are introducing, I think that is where the real question mark exists for me and it also offers a study in contrast.
While well were throng bill morneau, president trump was speaking in the United States, talking about how they will be sending basically a cheque to every american and he didn't have the exact amounts but it sound like everyone wants to go big.
and the financial expert we had on earlier was talking about that.
They've obviously chosen this approach over the direct -- you know, here's a cheque for Canadians approach.
But it will be a study in contrast especially where the administration of this is concerned and that question, which is normally a political one or procedural one isn't really one like that for Canadians right now.
They need the money now.
They need it quickly.
and so do businesses and so I think timing is really going to be something to watch.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
and the first step is to get it legged because most of these measures, it does require legislation.
Still have to bring parliament back or version of parliament.
It sounds like there is a widespread cooperation around that from other part is to get it done very quickly.
But that also a factor in delay.
There are the two mechanisms already in place.
The child tax benefit and the g. S.t. Benefit and the finance Minister laid out a little more in detail, david, how that will work.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
If I can, I'm going to pull back and maybe grossly oversimplify $82 billion in spending.
Because a lot of the answers that we just listened to were kind of like a Vulcan calculus class for a lot of people.
Essentially what's happened here is a down payment in the fight against COVID-19, an $82 billion down payment on the fight against it, promising that whatever it takes to get through this, we can do. and the fiscal capacity and the banking integrity is there for a country to respond.
$27 billion in direct aid so people have money coming in. $55 billion in tax deferrals primarily for business so businesses don't have money going out so they need to survive this next period of time.
They have promised credit cards, mortgage payments and student loans coming from the federal government so you don't have more money than necessary and the governor of the bank of Canada, has taken a series of measures along with the office of superintendent with financial institution, which is essentially the banking regulator to make sure the banks have about $500 billion in credit available to loan the companies to loan to people or to give people relief on things like mortgage payments and credit line payments so they can stay afloat.
That is the big picture theme of what we saw there today.
I -- of trying to put a financial safety net under ordinary Canadians, small and medium-sized businesses who are acutely vulnerable to this and the promise of more to come to the oil and gas sector which is getting slaughtered by this.
I've seen in Newfoundland and Labrador, ecuador has just deferred the next offshore oil project there which was going to be a lifeline for that particular province and promises of help for the airline sectors with westjet suspending international nights and porter shutting down entirely until June.
The nitty-gritty is a lot to absorb.
Essentially if you didn't qualify for e. Ism, you will qualify for a version of e. I., if you get the g. S.t. Credit and Canada child benefit.
They will be boosted and supplemented in the coming months.
So you can be kept whole.
But a big thing on this, the I. T. systems of the government have never been more important.
If you look at the phoenix payroll system and the challenges we've seen, you know, the Minister responsible for the Canada revenue agency and anita anan from public procurement, they have big behind the scenes roles that they have to deliver on right now in getting their departments and administrative structures ready to get this flood of cash into Canadians's pockets.



**Rosemary**:

Vassy, I'll go to you before I go to our financial adviser.
Just on the oil and gas sector because that is an area you cover closely.
I'm not sure how much I understood there about what is being discussed or how much is needed.
But presumably the provinces that rear re hind on oil and gas sectors are even going to be further hit because of the price of oil.



**Vassy**:

Yeah and it is not just Alberta, although it is to a great degree Alberta, but it's also Newfoundland and Labrador as well as Saskatchewan.
I heard the promise of more, but the only specific I heard come out is that the government is set to announce a significant, I think is how bill morneau described it, an investment in orphan well cleanup.
That is a suggestion that the federal conservative party has been making and one of the asks from premier Jason kenney, he has a longer list of asks that preceded even the impact of the coronavirus stuff that was already due to oil price issues as well as recession issues in Alberta a. He wanted somewhere in the neighbourhood of $2.5 billion in retroactive payments.
That was months ago when the economy wasn't even doing as badly.
I didn't hear about that specifically or maybe even more specifically for what Newfoundland and Labrador may need.
There was an acknowledgment that the general sector was hit and there might be more for them.
But the only specific I heard is there would be an investment in the coming days where orphaned wells are concerned.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to go back to Gareth Watson back in Toronto who has sat there that whole time for us which I appreciate.
Thank you for sitting there.
What did you hear there that was maybe re-assuring to you from either the governor or the Minister?



I'll just take away three key themes from this morning.
Number one is liquidity, which we talked about in the last segment about keeping money in the pocket s of Canadians.
They're trying their best to do that with all the programmes.
In UBS two is implementation.
David has talked about this.
How does this work? how does this get money to the people? I'm interested to see how this works with the banks.
Do I qualify? do you? what are the rules? is it income-based and all those details have to come out.
Number three is timing.
Of course, getting the money into people's hands and two to three weeks is the most opt mystic timeframe here but also the timing about when this whole coronavirus situation dissipates and the only way you can ask the question is whether today is enough is take it into context of timing.
Sit enough if this is done y March 31, which we know is not the case.
is it enough if it's done by March 31, which is not the case.
It has to be taken into context with the timeframe and we don't have the answer.
Which is also what the market is dealing with.
These are solutions to try and get us through this.
They are not solutions to the overall problem.
That lies in our hands as a meme out there said our grandparents were asked to go to war for rights and freedoms and we're being asked to sit on a couch.
[laughter]and I hope that Canadians are part of the solution as opposed to the problem.
We have a playbook and it is not the perfect playbook to repeat this time around.
But governor poloz made some re-assuring comments.
We've seen some of this before.
Last time basically everyone around the world were throwing solutions at the problem and hoping that they'd stick.
At least we have experience in dealing with this and we won't necessarily nail it 100% but we're in a better position to address these problems that historically before we haven't seen until 2008-2009.
It's not necessarily repetition but we have a hand book to come from.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you so much for sticking around and weighing in. Appreciate your time.
Gareth Watson in Toronto.
As you can see on your screen, the deputy Prime Minister and handful of ministers now beginning their daily briefing.
Let's listen in and get the latest information on updates about the COVID-19.







**Interpreter**:

The United States-Canada border is the symbol of an unprecedented partnership that secures both of our populations.
Every day $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border and this is essential to our trading partnership in both countries.
In response to the COVID-19 affecting us in Canada and the United States, we have both agreed to restrict nonessential travel cross our border.
Travelers will no longer be authorized to cross the border for recreational or tourism purposes.
In both of our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home.
This measure, this collaborative measure is reciprocal and is part of this prudent approach.
Border crossings that are essential will continue.
Both the United States and canadian governments are aware of the importance of maintaining essential supply chains.
These supply chains allow us to ensure that food and medication that is indispensable for they I can't understand and americans to cross the border.
These supply chains, including trucking will not be affected by this new measure.
Canadians and americans are both crossing borders every day to carry out essential work or for other urgent and essential reasons.
and that will not change.
Thus both Canada and the United States will restrict nonessential travel across the Canada-United States border.
The Canada-United States border represents a unique relationship between our countries and our people.
$2.7 billion in trade crosses the border every day and that trade is essential to economies and well-being of both Canadians and americans.
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, Canada and the United States are temporarily restricting all nonessential travel across the Canada-United States border.
Travelers will no longer be per myed to cross the border for recreation or tourism.
In both of our countries, we are encouraging people to stay home.
This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach.
Essential travel will continue unimpeded.
The canadian and United States governments recognize that it is critical for us to preserve supply chains between our two countries.
These supply chains ensure that food, fuel and life-saving medicines reach people on both sides of the border.
Supply chains, including trucking, will not be affected by this new measure.
Canadians and americans also cross the border every day to do essential work or for other urgent or essential reasons.
That will not be affected either.
Therefore, Canada and the United States will temporarily restrict all nonessential travel across the Canada-United States border.
Now let me just add that this agreement was concluded this morning in a phone call between the Prime Minister and the president.
I spoke twice yesterday with vice president mike pence and this morning with secretary pompeo.
Minister blair has been speaking often with his United States counterpart, secretary wolf, the secretary of homeland security and he will speak further about that.
This morning, I also held a phone call with all of the premiers of the provinces and territories.
We spoke about this and many other issues.
Later today, My colleague and I will be having a conversation with the leaders of the opposition.
Let mejust conclude by saying that we all now know that the advice of our experts is that this situation will get worse before it gets better.
What is also true that, as a country, we are rising to the challenge.
Individually, collectively.
We can do this.
Let's take care of ourselves and each other.
Everyone who can stay home should stay home.
The decisions that each one of us takes today will save lives.
So now let me turn to -- we will hear this morning from the Minister of public safety and emergency repairedness, bill blair.
Then we will hear from our inspirational Minister of health, patty hajdu and from our chief public health officer Dr. Tam and from our deputy chief public health officer, Dr. Njoo.




**Interpreter**:

We will then hear from the government house leader and Quebec lieutenant Pablo Rodriguez.



Thank you very much, Chrystia.
and good afternoon, everyone.
As the deputy Prime Minister has said, this is a very important day for Canadians and in our relationship with our American neighbours, the longest undefended border in the world is a boards er that we shairz and both of our countries acknowledge and recognize how our economies are integrated and how important it is that we work so collaboratively together in maintaining the integrity of that border but also in maintaining the essential trade activity that takes place between our two countries.
It is essential not just for us, but for our American allies and it is recognized in the agreement we have made today.
It is an acknowledgment that that trade is essential and needs to continue in these very difficult and trying times.
So while I think the announcement is quite clearly focused as the Prime Minister announced earlier today that we have agreed to temporarily restrict all nonessential travel across the Canada-United States border, it is equally important to acknowledge that what we have also achieved is we have secured those vital economic supply lines that will be absolutely essential, not only in maintaining health and safety of Canadians throughout this crisis, but assist greatly in the economic recovery that must surely follow.
Let me explain a little bit about what this actually will mean to travelers.
It means that travelers will no longer be permitted to cross the border between Canada and the United States for things like recreation and tourism.
But essential travel will continue unimpeded.
We recognize the critical importance of maintaining supply lines between our countries but it is also important to recognize that Canadians and americans cross this border every day to do essential work and for other urgent and essential reasons and these will not be impacted.
We know, for example, there are many border city where is citizens on one side of the border travel each day across that border to work in our hospitalsen to provide other essential services.
We have to make sure they can get to work.
? [please stand by]



I think it would be difficult to imagine two countries that are more closely linked and allied to economic integration and friendship than iscanada and the United States.
We share geography, history, and trade.
Our people are linked by our shared values and oureconomies.
and every day, as chrystiahas mentioned, Canada and the United States do $2.7 billion in trade.
Our businesses depend on the free flow of these goods and services, andthat's why we believe this announcement and what has been achieved in mutually agreed upon, reciprocal agreement with the United States to impose reciprocal measures that will be effective in keeping both of our communities safe.
It is about our health and safety and also about our eventual recovery.
The entire world is dealing with COVID-19, andcanada and the United States are now exception.
But we're working collaboratively together to face this challengehead-on, and we have, withall of our significantglobal challenges, we doit best when we worktogether.
Thank you very much.



Thank you very much, bill.
Now we'll hear from patty.



Hello, everyone.
The agreement with ouramerican neighbour announced earlier today are very important steps to support the health and safety and wellness of allcanadians.
Today I want to talk Little bit about another aspect of that, and that is Canada's testingcapacity.
We've been working around the clock with province sand territories to make sure everyone has what they need to continue to detect and interrupt the chain of transmission.
and provinces and territories have been wrapping up their capacity to do so in incredibleways.
I want to thank them for how quickly they'removing.
However, the situation is cons tartly moving.
We've approved two diagnostic tests.
As Dr. Tam has said, early diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness.
and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading, in terms of our testing capacity, think 44, 000 tests todate.
Dr. Tam has the most current numbers.
The efforts that we'reseeing from canadiansacross the country to slow the spread of virus is truly phenomenal.
and I know that the changes that we're seeing are overwhelming.
Changing our behaviours is not easy, but canadiansall across the country are showing that it ispossible.
From the small changes, like washing our hands more frequently, to the large ones like working from home andself-isolating whenpossible.
These are all helping ourfriends and colleaguesvery much.
[speaking throhinterpreter]and also to all workerswho are providing theirservices in thesedifficult times.
Our current actions, bothsmall and large, are veryimportant for our familiesand communities.
Thank you.
[speaking throhinterpreter]thank you and goodafternoon.
[end of translation]there are 165 countrieswith COVID-19. As of right now, there are598 cases of COVID-19 andeight deaths in Canada.
What is most concerning isthat over the past week, we started to see a sharprise in cases, and anumber of provinces havereported cases with nolinks to travel.
This is a signal there issome community spread.
The time to act is now.
Public health authoritiesacross Canada remain laserfocused on detecting beinterrupting any chains intransmission.
Today we have now testedover 50, 000 people forcovid-19. [speaking throhinterpreter]in addition to publichealth actions, governments, communitygroups, event organizers, and businesses have allbanded together to flattenthe epidemic curve.
Now it is up to the restof us, and Canadians areembracing the concepts ofsocial distancing.
Which is all aboutseparating yourself fromothers physically.
All across the countrypeople are looking atdifferent ways to maintainthat two-metre distance bystaying home from work andschool.
But, sorry, no play dates, parties, or sleepovers.
Avoiding public gatheringsand crowded spaces.
Avoiding public transport, where possible.
Arranging to havesupplies, such asgroceries, dropped off atthe door.
Separating from others inyour home, or rather nothaving visitors to yourhome, and using onlinetechnology to communicate.
and if you are an olderadult or have a medicalcondition, keeping thatprotective space.
But by all means, do goout for a walk in thefresh air as long as youkeep to the two-metrerule.
and be sure to wash yourhands as soon as you goback inside.

This is our chance righthere, right now.
MercÍ.



Thank you, Dr. Tam, for that clear and usefuladvice.
[speaking throhinterpreter]dr. Noo, do you haveanything to add? we would like to hear youspeak in french.



Doctor:[speaking throughinterpreter]I don't have anything elsebecause Dr. Tam spoke inboth official languages.



We talked about the next steps to recall the house of commons to bring in the emergency measures in response to thecovid-19 pandemic.
This morning we had our conference call with the house leaders, with whips from different parties, where we started to discuss the logistics around how this will work.
and I want to state very clearly that there is great collaboration among all parties.
We are working together to respond to this very serious challenge.
and we will continue our discussions in thismanner.
[speaking throhinterpreter]all of the parties agreedon the importance ofrecalling the house ofcommons, and I would liketo thank them sincerelyfor their collaboration.
Everyone is doingeverything that they canso this happens quickly, and I expect this tohappen next week.
I'm very pleased that allparties have been able towork together, especiallylast week.
It was done in exemplaryfashion.
We adopted the billsrequired so that thegovernment could continueto pay out money that isvery important for thepandemic.
We did a lot last week, but there is still more todo.
New laws are required tohelp all Canadians.
[end of translation]



We passed these measures quickly in order to provide support tocanadians in need.
and I will continue to engage with the opposition in an open, transparent and collaborative manner.
and together we'll bring back the house of commons in a responsible way and work on legislation that will help canadiansthrough this difficulttime.
Now, how will this work? the government will writ ea letter to the speaker of the house of commons.
It will indicate that in the public interest that the house of commons be recalled in order to bring in emergency economic measures to help allcanadians.
If the speaker accepts therequest, the house then could be recalled 48 hourslater.
While the details have not been decided yet, My sense is it could happen nextweek, and we're working in that direction.
[speaking throhinterpreter]as we know, the houserequires a quorum of 20members to sit, and I willcontinue to discuss withthe opposition parties asto the number of memberswho will be present, anumber that respects theproportion of the parties in the house, so itreflects the compositionof the house.

**AND WE SAW HOW QUICKLYTHE HOUSE AND THE SENATEREACT TO THE EXTRAORDINARYDECISIONS BY WORKINGTOGETHER IN THE BESTINTEREST OF CANADIANS.

[Speaking French][Speaking throhinterpreter]AND WE MUST REALIZE WHATWE'RE DOING ISUNPRECEDENTED. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR**:

[end of translation]



We are all in this crisis together, and we will face it together and we will get through ittogether.
MercÍ.



Thank you, Pablo.
and two other ministers are also with us. and I know that they will be delighted to answer any of your questions.
Thank you.[speaking throughinterpreter]thank you.
We will now go toquestions.




Reporter:[speaking throughinterpreter]ms. Chrystia Freeland, anumber of you have spoken, but we don't know when theborder will be closed totravelers.
I'm talking about thecanada-United States border.
Can you be clear on that? [speaking throhinterpreter]yes, I can answer yourquestion.
As you know, as the Prime Minister has explained, for us it was veryimportant to have acoordinated and reciprocalresponse along with the United states.
We are neighbours andpartners.
As concerns the details, including the matter ofwhen the new measures willbe implemented, we arecurrently confirming that.
In very closecollaboration with ourneighbours to the south.
But I can tell you rightnow that it is not thetime to travel fornon-essential purposes, for tourism or recreation.
and we have already madethe decision, with theUnited States president, and wehave spoken about thisdecision, and so haspresident trump, concerning the exactmoment as to when thisband will come into place.
We're coordinating theexact details right nowbecause we have to workwith a great number ofpeople who are workingevery day on the border.
I would also like to sayto Canadians that we arein extraordinary times.
and in these extraordinarytimes, it is important tomake decisions veryswiftly.
That's what we have donetoday and this week.
When we make thesedecisions very swiftly, wethink it is important to be honest and open withcanadians, to announcewhen the decision is made, that the decision has beenmade, and to be ready andopen and to say all thedetails have not yet beennailed down to the lastone, but that it will bedone in the hours to come.
[end of translation][end of translation]



**I'LL JUST REPEAT THATIN ENGLISH. IN TERMS OF THE ACTUALMOMENT OF ENTRY INTOFORCE, LET ME BE CLEAR**:

The decision has beentaken, and this is decision to restrict entry of at the canadian-United States border of Canadians andamericans traveling acrossthe border fordiscretionary, non-essential purposes, for example, tourism andrecreation.
That travel will not bepermitted.
The question was: what isthe precise moment whenthese instructions will beenforced at the border? and the answer is: we arestill working verynary veryenergetically with ouramerican colleagues todetermine the precisemoment when that will been forced by thehard-working people at theborder.
Let me be clear: adecision has been taken, the decision who's beenannounced by or Prime Minister and the United States president.
Anyone considering make atrip United States the United States border, please do not do it. It is not good for you oryour neighbours.
Patty has been very goodin explaining this.
We are working right nowin an exceptional time.
I think we all understandthat.
What that means is aspolitical leader, we needto operate a little bitdifferently.
We need to be in aposition to take decisionsvery quickly, and we needto be honest and open withcanadians about thosedecisions.
So a clear decision hasbeen taken.
Each one of the practicaldetails has not yet beenagreed.
But even as we are sittinghere, that practical workis being done, and thedetails will be announcedas soon as they'reconfirmed.




Reporter:[speaking throughinterpreter]so, yes, you're talkingabout being honest.
Are you talking about daysor weeks?



Do you mean for thedecision?



a number of hours ordays.
Minister Rodriguez, if the houses were called nextweek, doesn't that mean that cheques will be dict drct[in audible for theinterpreter]



I am very happy that all of the opposition parties have supported the government and we have agreed to call the house very quickly.
It is going to take the full bill, that will have to be sent to the speaker of the house, and 48 hours after that, the house can be recalled.
Thank you.
[end of translation]



I was going to ask bill if he has a point to add to your first question.



**I DON'T HAVE A GREATDEAL TO ADD, EXCEPT I WILLASSURE YOU OUR OFFICIALSARE MOVING VERY RAPIDLY TOTHE DECISION THAT WAS MADETODAY. IT IS RECIPROCAL THATTHOSE MEASURES WILL BE PUTIN PLACE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKETHE POINT**:

I would very much urge Canadians andamericans to respect the principle behind the decision that was made and avoid non-essentialtravel.



**Reporter**:

Dr. Tam, you're in constant contact with your counterparts.
How many ventilators doescanada have, and testkits, and how many do you estimate that we need?



**Doctor**:

Well, rightnow, the federal provincial territory table on looking at logistics is very much meeting every single day.
Certainly the -- we are actually preempting any need for ventilators by purchasing some already for the federal level.
Even though there hasn'tbeen any specificrequests, necessarily, for some of them, we're trying to just preempt any need.
In terms of the otherapplies, for example, we've secured 800, 000swabs, just for test kits, for example.
As I said, Canada has already tested 50, 000people.
800, 000 swabs go someways, but it doesn't mean we can stop.
We keep getting more on an ongoing basis.
This is not a staticreality.
But the reality is that there is global challenges in securing certain supplies and certain types of personal protectiveequipment.
What I do know is the personal protective equipment that is needed by Canada, we can currently expect to meet those needs about at least75% of the requestedamount.
But we're pulling ought stops to look at any other suppliers and purchasing from any other means.
I don't want to say that in Canada we shouldn't betaking very good care of our supplies.
We must not waste things.
We have to be really careful in the hospital sand how you actually use those supplies.
and we're working really hard to provide guidance to people on the stewardship aspect.



and I think patty has something to add.



I'll is just add tothat.
We're working through the health agency of Canada, and the Minister ofprecurement and her time to put in large, largeorders.
Because even though the provinces and territories have indicated what they might need, we may needmore.
Dr. Tam is clear and quite direct in saying we're not the only country looking for these kinds ofsupplies.
We're also looking for the minister of innovation and science and economicdevelopment, ministerbains, to make sure we have a capacity withincanada to in some cases help factories and other manufacturers who maybe are not able to make the things they sell rightnow, but can rapidly retool to make the things that we're going to need.
So that work is happening right now.
The reason we can't give you exact numbers is because it is in the fluctuation period.
As provinces are drawing down materials from our national stockpile, of course we're trying to seek to replace them, and, in fact, increase the amount we need over and above what we may eventually use.
I think this is a prudent measure to ensure that we can have what we need, ensure that we even, perhaps, buy more than what we need.
I will also say that manufacturers globally are trying to make sure that countries aren'tstockpiling in the way that will prevent the ability of other countries to get what they need.
So this is a global effort that is happening onprocurement, and on trying to coordinate what countries will need whenthey're seeing theepidemic, or the spike, if you will, of their particular curve fit.
It is important to remember that those globalcommunities, those countries that don't have access to those kinds ofsupplies, matter just asmuch, even though it might not seem so when you're in the middle of a crisis.
But, in fact, if we can'tactually think ahead to what countries are going to be hit next will need, if they're infectionsincrease, then that continues that wave of virus from circling theglobe.
What we're trying to do is accelerate our supplies from immediate urgentneed, accelerate our work on the treatment forcovid-19, and accelerate our work on a vaccine.
Because until we actually get all of those three things working together, we could actually see scenario where we would have the virus continue to circle the globe.
That's the true challengehere.
So we're working veryclosely, as Dr. Tam hassaid, with our provincial territorial partners, and also our internationalpartners.
To make sure what we procure today we have capacity to, first of alluse, and possibly share down the line if we end up having more than we need.
All of that evolves inrealtime.
That's why it is so hard to give you precision around numbers.



**I WANT TO UNDERSCOREONE THING PATTY HAS SAID, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANTWORK BEING LED BY MINISTERBAINS AND MR. ANON, WHICHWAS DISCUSSED TODAY BY THEPREMIERS IN THEIR CALL. IT IS ACTUALLY REALLYINSPIRING, WHICH IS**:

Canadian manufacturers are putting up their hands an dare stepping up, and are looking at whether they have the capacity to retool and to produce her eat home the Cynthia that thingseneed.
and that has really been just an example for me ofcanada coming together, Canada being united.
They are being extremelycreative.
They're working with theprovinces, they're working with us. We'll have more to tell you as these ideas and these efforts actually come to bear fruit.
It is a real example of ate am Canada approach, andi'm very grateful to all of the manufacturers who have been in touch withus, who have been in touch with their provincial leaders to say, you knowwhat, I think I can make this stuff for ourcountry.



President trump said Otis not at this moment trading between the twocountries? could borders affect trade and what could be theconsequences?



**IT IS A GREAT QUESTION, AND A REASON WHY WE TOOKTHE TIME THAT WE NEEDED TOWORK THIS THROUGHCAREFULLY ANDCOOPERATIVELY WITH OURAMERICAN NEIGHBOURS, WASBECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND NOWESSENTIAL THAT TRADINGRELATIONSHIP IS, AND OURAMERICAN NEIGHBOURSUNDERSTAND HOW ESSENTIALTHAT RELATIONSHIP IS ASWELL. YOU HEARD FROM THEPRESIDENT, YOU HEARD FROMTHE PRIME MINISTER, WE AREABSOLUTELY CLEAR THATTHESE BORDER RESTRICTIONSWILL IN NO WAY IMPEDE THETRADING RELATIONSHIP. THEY WILL IN NO WAY IMPEDETHE ESSENTIAL TRADEHAPPENING BETWEEN CANADAAND THE UNITED STATESEVERY DAY. WE UNDERSTAND ON BOTHSIDES OF THE BORDER, THELAST THING THE CANADIAN ORU.S. ECONOMIES NEED RIGHTNOW IS ANOTHER BLOW. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUTSAYING NON-DISCRETIONARYTRAVEL SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. IF YOU'RE TRIP IS NOTESSENTIAL, IF IT-l IS FORTOURISM OR RECREATION, JUST DON'T TAKE IT. AND THERE IS TREMENDOUSCLARITY ON BOTH SIDES THATTRADE NEEDS TO CONTINUE. AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS NEEDTO CONTINUE TO CROSS THEBORDERS TO DO THEIR JOBS. I WANT TO REALLYUNDERSCORE ONE OTHERTHING, WHICH IS**:

This is time when all countries in the world, as we heard from Dr. Tam, this is global pandemic.
Every country is really struggling with tremendous challenges at home.
In that struggling, I struggle, kit is a very positive thing that Canada and the United states have managed to handle our border in this very collaborative and reciprocal way.
It says something about the partnership that we have here in northamerica.



Do you have anything toadd?



I will also simply say, I'm having very regular conversations with my provincial counterparts.
All of them have stressed the importance of maintaining those supply chains and economic activity that crosses back and forth between ourborders.
They cite very specificexamples.
That observation really informed our discussion with our counterparts in the United States, who also recognized itsimportance.
It is important today.
It is important every day.
The food that goes on ourshelves, the pharmaceuticals that we will require, are all part of that international trade between our twocountries.
But it is also essential to maintain those supplies to facilitate the economic recovery that will come.
Many of our businesses aresuffering, or are going tosuffer.
In the very difficult circumstances that we face in the near future.
But it is also important to maintain the economic conditions that will give rise to the recovery.
That was also very much apart of our discussion with our americancolleagues and with our provincial partners across the country.
[speaking throhinterpreter]Minister, My question goesto you.
We've been talking aboute.
I. measures or parallelmeasures.
In the context wherepublic officials areworking from home, theirchildren are not atschool, what -- howconfident are you of beingable to process so manyapplications?



Thank you.
We are putting unprecedented measures in place to ensure that all workers and families, as well as businesses, aresupported.
No one is being left behind with the measures that Minister morneau hasannounced.
Whether people are eligible for e. I. or not, whether it is people who need to be at home to take care of themselves, theirfamilies, their children, who are not going toschool, whether it is to take care of elderlyparents, or because they have lost their jobs --all these people, all workers and families are being supported, especially the mostvulnerable.
and before going to yourquestion, when we'retalking about vulnerable, we're talking about very vulnerable people.
and some of the measures announced today, when you look at them, have considerable support, and provide considerable support to families who are having a great deal of difficulty right now.
Here is an example of alone parent woman, am other with two children at home, and she has to be home as well because she has to take care of her children because they'renot at school or because she has lost her job.
That person would have already received about$1, 000 of Canada childbenefits, and with the measures announced thismorning, she'll receive another $1500.
and she will beprotected.
So these are measuresotell Canadians that we'renot -- that we're thinking of you.
Now, with regard to the public service, we trust their ability to do this work in these exceptional times because we know that government officials are also going through theseproblems.
and they are aware of the major role that they'regoing to be playing in thefuture.
So, for example, the computer services are being adapted, and directives are clear, they must take care of themselves and theirfamilies.
They must teleworkwherever possible, except in exceptional circumstances that would require the security of the government.
a follow-up:



Do you think we'll beyou'll be able to pay up in two three weeks? because sometimes it takes months to receive thecheques.
What measures are you taking to make sure this will be done quickly.
Answer:



There have been an umber of measures.
First, there are improvements being made to the e. I. system.
Now, those, rather, will not be made.
We're going to focus on the people who need our help more immediately.
and a number of measures that were announced today, for example, the boosting of the g. S.t. Credit andthe emergency care benefitand the emergency supportbenefit, those twobenefits will be set up by the C.R.A. which has the ability to act much more quickly and affectivelythan service Canada.
Obviously service canadahas had trouble processing demands very quickly, as we know.
So service Canada already has enough on its plate.
So that is why C.R.A. Willtake over in some regards.
Thank you.



Questions on the phone?



Thank you.




The first question is from Mary Kay Walsh from the "globe and mail".



**MY FIRST QUESTION ISFOR MINISTER FREELAND, ANDMY FOLLOWUP WILL BE FORMINISTER PATTY HAJDU. THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHATPRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THISMORNING. HE SAID**:

At this moment trade will continue.
Can you please respond tothat.



Sure.
Let me be really clear and really reassuring.
This has been a verypositive, very collaborative conversation with our americanneighbours.
There was absolute agreement from the first sentence that was uttered that it is essential forcanada and the United States to continue maintain the very important trade between our two countries.
There was not even anatomy, a molecule, ofpushback on that.
It is what we said from the outset, and what ouramerican partners said from the outset.
We also heard in the context of theseconversations, forexample, in my conversation withvice-president penceyesterday, the realimportance that he placeson nafta, how delighted heis that Canada was able toratify it -- was it juston Friday, pablo? I mentioned it to him, andhe said, you didn't needto mention it to me, Chrystia, we noticed itright away.
It is very important tous.
It is a very importantvote of confidence in thenorth american economy atthis difficult time.
I would really see thisagreement as a true voteof confidence by canadaand the United States inthe importance ofmaintaining that essentialtrade at a very difficulttime.
and I also see it as anexample of how we areable, at a really, reallydifficult time, to be goodneighbours to each other.
You know, one of thethings -- I don't thinkvice-president pence willmind if I say that, hesaid to me yesterday, look, the president issaying to everyone it istime to stay put.
We hear your Prime Minister saying tocanadians, now is the timeto stay at home.
So we really see this asan extension of those verycorrect policies in bothof our countries.
Where we're saying topeople, now is the time tostay home.
Now is the time topractice socialdistancing.
and an extension of that, we heard Dr. Tam actuallyadvice us, now is not thetime to go visiting yourneighbours.
and that includes now isnot the time to go visityour american neighbours, or for our americanneighbours, now is not thetime to come and visit us. [speaking throhinterpreter]the question was inaudableaudibefor the interpreter.



**THE CONVERSATION THATBILL HAD WITH SECRETARYWOLFE, THEY WERE A NUMBEROF VERY PRODUCTIVECONVERSATIONS THAT THEPRIME MINISTER HAS HADWITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE'RE IN VERY CLOSE ANDEFFECTIVE COLLABORATIONWITH THEM. EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. WE HAVE ALREADY HADARGUMENTS WITH AMERICANS, THAT'S TRUE. BUT IN THIS CASE, THEREARE NO ARGUMENTS. WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THEIMPORTANCE OF TRADEBETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. AND IT IS MORE IMPORTANTNOW THAN EVER BECAUSE, ASMINISTER MORNEAU EXPLAINEDTHIS MORNING, AND AS THEPRIME MINISTER EXPLAINEDAS WELL, THESE ARE TOUGHTIMES, ECONOMICALLYSPEAKING, AS WELL. SO FOR US, BY MAKING THISDECISION, BY ANNOUNCINGTHIS DECISION, WE WANT TODO TWO THINGS**:

On the onehand, to continue our policy of socialdistancing.
That's very important.
and at the same time, to reassure both canadiansand Americans that we understand the importance of trade between the twocountries.
and that that trade willcontinue.
Thank you.
[end of translation]



I think the secondpart, bill, do you have anything to add? okay.
and the second part was for patty.



There was a followup question from the "globeand mail" over the phone.



I have a followup question for minister patty hajdu.
My question is about essential workers who are terrified and contactingus, wondering if it is still safe for them to be operating in the truckingindustry, to still be in public works.
What is the message forthem? you're telling everybody to stay home, and yetyou're also telling them to stay on the front line?



**I'M START AND THEN TURNTO DR. TAM, BECAUSE ITHINK THE CLARITY AROUNDWHO NEEDS TO SOCIALLYISOLATE AND WHAT THATLOOKS LIKE WILL BEDIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THECONTEXT OF EACH PERSON. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TOTHANK ALL OF THE WORKERSON THE FRONT LINE, THATARE SERVING IN A VARIETYOF DIFFERENT WAYS THATKEEP OUR GROCERIESSTOCKED, OUR PHARMACIESRUNNING, OUR LIGHTS ON, IFYOU WILL, AND THE GOODSMOVING BACK AND FORTH. WE KNOW THAT WE OWE YOUALL A DEBT OF GRATITUDE. BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THATTHERE ARE PRECAUTIONS THATPEOPLE CAN TAKE WHENTHEY'RE WORKING TO MAKESURE THAT THEY, THEMSELVES, ARE NOTCONTRACTING THE VIRUS ORUNWITTINGLY SPREADING ITTO OTHER PEOPLE. DR. TAM SAID SOMETHINGYESTERDAY THAT WAS REALLYIMPORTANT, AND I THINK AWAY FOR ALL OF US PEOPLETHAT ARE HEALTHY TO THINKABOUT THIS. IT IS -- OBVIOUSLY WE'REALL WORRIED ABOUT CATCHINGTHE VIRUS, BUT IF YOU ACTLIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE IT, AND YOU'RE PROTECTING THEPERSON NEXT TO YOU FROMGETTING IT, IT IS A VERYUSEFUL WAY TO THINK ABOUTIT. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF USSTILL, REMEMBER, WILLEXHIBIT MILD TO MEDIUMSYMPTOMS. MOST OF US WILL NOT DIE OFGETTING VOLVED. COVID-19. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TODO WITH SOCIAL DISTANCINGIS PROTECTING PEOPLE INOUR LIVES FROM GETTING IT. I WILL REGENT THEM AGAINJUST FOR GOOD MEASURE**:

We should wash our hands.
We should definitely stay two metres away from one other in public spaces.
We should stagger our working hours if we have the capacity to do that.
We should, for sure, stay home when we're sick, and let our employers we'reunable to work when we'resick.
That was part of the package today, was to make sure that everybody can dothat, regardless of their own personal benefits or insurance situations.
and ultimately, at the end of the day, these measure swill make sure we protect those people who are countering on us. I'll turn to Dr. Tam to speak a little more specifically aboutfrontline workers and things they can do.



**Doctor**:

There is allot that every workplace can do to look at how todo the social distancing without really impacting the critical work that they do. I'm most familiar, forexample, with the healthcare sector.
Of course the health care sector is very, veryimportant.
So you cannot just keep all health care workers athome.
This is not possible.
You actually need themworking.
So you institute specificthings, like screening at the front door of thehospital, so making sure that the sick health care workers don't go to work.
That they have the ability to remove themselves as soon as they have signs of any illness, for example.
Which is why, obviously, there are brought messages for the public.
For every workplace, every essential service, have the ability to think about how you do social distancing and still maintain the incredible job that everybody isdoing.
I do think that in some cases people can dotelework.
But in other cases, inconstruction, for example, no, you can't. But you might be in an open kind of space.
You might maintain ascertain distance fromothers, and absolutely wash your hands.
But as the Minister of health said, the most important thing really, really is not to go to work when you're sick.
This is not something that people intuitively are doing in north America, quite frankly.
We just sort of keep going and going and going, andthat's not how you want to behave at this time.
If you are doing some incredibly importantthings, like maintaining grocery stores open --everybody needs food --ways to practice hygienic measures are to have alcohol hand sanitizersthat are ready.
Definitely wash your hands when you go home.
But it is some of those very basic personal hygienic measures that you can use at work to maintain your health and not spread it to others.
Maybe you're working wit holder people.
You need to take special precautions to protectthem, long-term carefacilities.
So I think there are somany different ways, and ido think companies areactually really steppingup and looking also atinnovative ways thatpeople can do things.
Doctors are doing moretelemedicine.
So you don't stop yourgeneral practice or familypractice, you just do it in a different way.



We'll go to the next question over the phone.



**Caller**:

Thank you.



The following question is from Justin links.



**Caller**:

Hi there.
The question is for the deputy Prime Minister.
Are you satisfied with the way the government has communicated to thepublic.
Press conferences have been waived in some cases.
and travel bans have taken hours to get to thepublic.
and really, the government of Canada is not releasing significant amount of data about the newtransmission.
It is leaving that to theprovinces.
I am wondering if you think changes need to be made going forward to communicate moreaffectively with thepublic?



As the prime minister always reminds us in cabinet meetings, better is always possible.
and I fully embrace that and accept that.
and I also really understand the absolute paramount importance of effective communication during this time.
This is a time when, first of all, things are changing and developingvery, very fast.
and this is a time when people are understandablyanxious.
and so people are absolutely right to be demanding of our government that we communicate often, and that we communicateaffectively.
The fact that we are here now every day is part of our commitment to doingthat.
When it comes to communication that you'rehearing at the federal level and at the provincial level, look, Canada is not a highly centralized country.
Quite the contrary.
and I really would like to salute and embrace and encourage the way in which provincial leaders, thepremiers, are doing fantastic job and are being leaders in theirprovinces.
That is something we support 100%. I had a very good call with the premiers thismorning.
and I said that to themdirectly.
They are the frontlinehealth care providers, and think each one of them is doing a terrific job of taking that leadership and -- tlgovernment will never want to get in their way.
We want to support and encourage them, and that is what we're seeking todo.
At the same time, it is very important, because this is a global pandemic -- it is very important for the provinces to understand and for Canadians to understand we are not going to be quibbling about federal provincialjurisdiction, that the federal government understands that we need to play a leadership role, and that's what we'redoing, including very mu chin health care.
and that was one of the reasons for having the call with the premiers this morning, was to hear directly from them -- and said to them, let's be sure we're communicating with each other.
Tell me what you need, and we will be here to provideit.
and I know patty does that with the provincial ministers very, veryregularly.
I would also like to salute the leadership which we are seeing from the mayors.
I did a call yesterday with the big-city mayors, and we are seeing a lot ofmayors -- all of themayors, really, steppingup and doing what theirmunicipalities need.
That is a really goodthing as well.
One other thing I do wantto say is all of us ascanadians needs to getused to a situation inwhich things are changingand moving much morerapidly than we areaccustomed to. This is a global pandemic, and the consequence ofthese very importantmeasures we are taking tolimit the spread of thatpandemic in Canada meanthat there are seriouscollateral economicimpacts, which the Prime Minister and the financeminister addressed today.
Dr. Tam shared with usyesterday an inspirationalquote from an irish doctorthat she works withthrough the W.H.O., who has said to us all, youknow, choose speed overperfection.
and that is a great motto.
That is our motor.
So what you're going to see from our government is the an absolute acknowledgement we are notperfect.
What we can promise you is that we are going to act with the alacrity and agility that this situation needs.
We may make important announcements thatcanadians need to know about without being able to fill in all of thedetails.
That is an open and honest way to operate in thissituation, and that's whatwe're going to do. I see patty wants to addsomething.
Please.



**THE DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER AND I AREBECOMING EXTREMELYINTUITIVE ABOUT EACH OTHERIN THIS PROCESS. I'LL JUST AGREE LARGELYWITH THE DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER, AND I WILL SAYSINCE THE BEGINNING OF THEOUTBREAK, WE'VE BEENTALKING DAILY AND THESITUATION EVOLVES DAILY. AND SOMETIMES WHAT WETHOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUTTHESE BRAND NEW VIRUS WITHA WHOLE BUNCH OF NEWRESEARCH AND SCIENCE, ISNOT WHAT WE FIND OUT THENEXT DAY, OR THERE IS NEWEVIDENCE OR NEW APPROACHESTO TRY. MUCH LIKE THE DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER HAS SAID, WE HAVEBEEN OBVIOUSLY WORKINGVERY HARD TO MAKE SURETHAT WE ARE RESPONDING TOEACH NEW AREA AND CRISISTHAT THIS VIRUS PRESENTSITSELF. SOMEONE I AM VERY CLOSE TOTHE OTHER DAY TOLD ME ABIT OF AN ANALOGY. HE SAID TO ME**:

You know, it is like an earthquake went off in Wuhan all those months ago.
and I looked back the other day about when first talked to the press corps about the COVID-19outbreak.
It was at the cabinetretreat in January, mid-January.
At that time, we didn'treally know what we weredealing with.
We knew we had a newdisease.
We knew we didn't have anand dantedote, and we didn'tknow what extent it wouldpose to the world healthsituation.
So we've been talkingevery day since then, andof course so much haschanged.
I smiled a bit when one ofmy colleagues said, ithink it was the deputyprime Minister who said topaula, was that just onfriday? because every day isfeeling like a week.
I think it is that way forcanadians, too, as they'rewatching the news.
We're going to be herewith Canadians every stepof the way.
We're going to take thosehard decisions togetherand we're going to figureout these really bigchallenges togetherbecause no portfolio isunaffect the.
unaffected.
That big tsunami happened, and we've been watching itaround the world, andwe're trying to prepareourselves as a country.
and we've done a ton ofscenario planning, buteach portfolio has anumber of things that areimplicated.
So I want to thankcanadians for being sosupportive.
I know there are lots ofworries and lots ofconcerns and lots of backand forth.
But I want also canadiansto know we are obviouslytaking this extremelyseriously, as you can seeby the announcements dayafter day.
and I want to thank thepress corps as well, because you're trying tokeep up and providingcanadians information thatis accurate as it can be, as timely as it can be, and especially given thevolume of informationcoming at you.
I know you're workingaround the clock, just as we are.
I think the service you'reproviding to Canadians isexemplary.
and the fact that so manyof your outlets are makingyour news storiesavailable free, without apay wall, is criticallyimportant because we'reall going to be able to doour things moreaffectively and protectourselves and our familiesmore affectively if wehave information that isevolving as rapidly as itchanges.
Thank you.



**THIS IS A FOLLOWUP**:

Iamb wondering if you can tell me if there is good data communications from the federal government to the provinces.
After the SARS outbreak, are port found there was no centralized data collection we could share with other countries or provinces and healthauthorities.
Quickly for the houseleader, I'm wondering if you can tell me any consideration of having parliament meet digitally, over teleconferencing? it flies in the face of the government's request for people to stay home ifyou're calling M.P.s andsenators from across thecountry.



That was two followupquestions, Justin.
I think Dr. Tam will take the first, and Pablo will take the second.



Yes.
So I work with all of the chief medical officers ofhealth, and they've been extremely collaborative.
Information is center to us at the national level.
Obviously some of it is very detailed at the locallevel.
That is not the kind of data you send at the national level.
At the national level, we maintain privacy and we get very critical dataelements, and that is absolutely happening.
But you also have to remember that some of the public health investigations take a bit of time.
So when you find a caseand?s you want to look atcontacts, and you find outmore about those contacts, and you investigate them, it is not that that is aninstantaneous thing.
Chief medical officerswere picking up the phone, even when they found a newcase even in the middle ofthe night.
Lab testing.
We know when a lab testbecomes positive, even ifwe didn't know any of thepatients that wereactually linked to thepositive tests.
That has been happeningreally in realtime.
So do we need moredetailed data in order tolook at more indepthresearch? yes.
Again, that's throughresearch funding.
That's not necessarilysurveillance or casereporting.
There are a lot of theelements that are donethrough actual researchstudies and those are alsoongoing as well.
All I can say is we've hadincredible collaboration.



Okay.
Pablo?



Yes.
Well, to answer very directly to theteleconference, if seating of parliament is notpossible.
But there are different ways to call backparliament.
The one we're looking at is with a minimal number of -- we know that the quorum is 20. We could go to 25 or 30. We are actually, as wespeak, the whips are discussing the differentscenarios.
Let's say with bring back25 M.P.s that reflectthe proportion of thehouse, a mirror of thehouse, and we take M.P.sthat don't have to travelby plane.
Thank you for being withus.
We'll go to the questionover the phone.




The next question.



**Caller**:

Goodafternoon.
Everyone.
I would like to begin wit ha special request that would be to trying to show up on time for press conferences because since many journalists are working from home, it is difficult to get telephonelines.
My question, the firstone, goes to ms. Freelandconcerning the borderclosure.[speaking throughinterpreter]we were talking about a30-day period.
Could you tell us aboutsnowbirds? there will be many of themcoming home.
So imagine that a snowbirdgets to the border withcovid-19 symptoms.
Where will those people beput in quarantine? will they stay in the United states? or will they be allowedinto Canada? thank you.



Concerning the period for which we made adecision, I would just start by appointing out that this is a temporarysituation.
and the Prime Minister and the president were very clear between themselves that this is a temporarysituation.
As concerns for how long this will be the case, Canada's proposal was to put this in place for 30days, but after that to review that.
So perhaps during our press conference this has been confirm.
and if it was confirmed by the president, then so much the better.
As concerns snowbirds, that is a personaldecision, but I would like to reassure all canadiansthat Canadian resident swill always have the right to come home.
and all Canadians have been told by the Prime Minister that now is the time to come back home.
To come back to Canada.
[end of translation]



**BILL, DO YOU HAVEANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD? [Speaking French][Speaking throhinterpreter]CONCERNING THE SNOWBIRDS, THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS**:

Forcanadians abroad, there is screening done if someone is symptomatic and doesn'twant to take a flight.
There are measures for the government to supportcanadians abroad.
What happens at theborder? well, there is the quarantine act.
and what happens with our border officers is that the person will be tested.
If they need medicalfollowup, then that person will be placed under the quarantine act and will be followed up as necessary.



Yes, but will that person be quarantined incanada?



Yes, yes.



Okay.
Mr. Minister Rodriguez, you might have been watching news reports inquebec.
We have heard quebecerssay, well, listen, COVID-19, I think it is just like a flu and so I'mgoing to continue to go tocuba and get a tan.
What do you tell those people who are making thatdecision? because they are jeopardizing the health and safety of manycitizens.[speaking throughinterpreter]answer:



We're telling them to listen and follow government instructions.
People are being asked to stop any travel that isnon-essential, especiallyfor personal orrecreational or tourismreasons, because thiscrisis will depend on theindividual gestures thatpeople make.
Thank you.
[end of translation]



I have a question.
Dr. Tam, as director ofimmunization, you had signed off on a masterplan, preparedness plan for pandemics.
You recall it well.
It had estimates, with all of the normal cautions.



All right, this is the end of a long press conference with cabinets cab catministers.
First of all, the announcement that there will be the temporary closing of the Canada-United States border, although we don'tknow exactly when.
and the second, significant economicmeasures will be broughtin over the next fewweeks.
$27 billion in directspending and other tactd taxdeferral measures.
David Cochrane has beenwatching all of this.
President trump talkedabout this as well.
We don't exactly know whenthis is going to start.



**Reporter**:

It seems to be skewing towards the end of this week.
They wanted to get the message out there and signal all of the people.
We heard from the deputy prime Minister that we'regoing to be making announcements that wewon't have all of the details ironed out on. That's the way the worldis.
The border is closing at ascertain point to all notnon-essential travel, andthere is payments topeople to stabilize theeconomy.
and two news tests havebeen approved to expandtesting in Canada.
That will help withidentifying where thevirus is, but expect aspike in numbers becauseof that.
They have ordered 800, 000swabs.
and there are plans toorder more.
and a really criticalthing: industry isretooling to build thingslike ventilators, andldeferring factories andmachine shops towardsmedical equipment.



**Rosemary**:

David, thanks for your help throughout this.
and thanks to Vassy.
You can watch David later on "the national" and vaswill be on "power andpolitics." the border will temporarily close tonon-essential travel, perhaps as early as thisfriday.
President trump suggestingit could last as much as30 days, and the measuresto try to get moneydirectly into your pocketsstill have to be passed byparliament.
They say that could take anumber of weeks.
This has been a cbc newsspecial report.
Thank you for watching.
Coverage continues on CBC News network.
