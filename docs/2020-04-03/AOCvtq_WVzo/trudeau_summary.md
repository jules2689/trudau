On Monday I announced Canada was closing its air borders to people who are not canadiancitizens or permanent residents with some exceptions.
Today, we've announced$27 billion in direct support tocanadian workers and businesses plus 55 billion to meet liquidity needs of canadianbusinesses and households to help stabilize the economy through tax deferrals.
Like many of you, over the past few days, I have seen stories of people doing just that.
Of people donating money to food banks to help those in need.
Of young people giving a hand to elderly neighbours by dropping off some extra groceries at thedoor.
Groceries keeping their shelves full and our family said, postal workers helping us stay home.



We talked about exactly that thismorning, president Donald trump and I, to ensure that indeed our economies and our people that are so interconnected in so many different ways will be able to ensure the smooth flow of good sand essential materials and medication across the border.



Right now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting income or revenue because of this COVID-19challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, topay their rent, to support theirfamilies through these difficulttimes.
We know the fundamentals of thecanadian economy are strong andin a number of weeks or monthsor however long it takes, oncewe get rolling again thecapacity of the federalgovernment to invest in theeconomy, to support businessesand individuals will ensure webounce back strongly. many workers do not qualify and, therefore, we're putting in place exceptional measures that will flow money to them every two weeks.
Our capacity to do this is something that we have spent a lot of time over the past days insuring because we know that that could make the difference not just between one family facing tougher times or not, but it could make a difference on the health of all Canadians.
People need to be able to self-isolate. That is why we're putting forward $27 million in direct supports to Canadians and businesses.
That is why we're moving forward on freeing up $55 billion that will stay in the economy because of delayed tax payments to make sure that people can cover the things they need to in the coming days.
Along with all of our extra measures for shelters, for indigenous communities, through the Canada child benefit and others that will ensure that Canadians have the confidence that they will be Ok.through this difficult time.
