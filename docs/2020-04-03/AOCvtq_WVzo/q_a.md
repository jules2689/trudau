Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
British Columbia has been asking since last week that the border be closed.
Now you saw the number of cases in Washington and the numbers in British Columbia that have gone way up. Why did you not close the border sooner and do you believe -- do you believe that perhaps you acted a bit too late for British Columbia? well, we took major measures on Monday to close off our borders to international travelers and we took two days to co-ordinate this further measure with the United States to ensure that we do it properly and in cooperation with each other.
The deputy Prime Minister, ms. Freeland, called vice president pence yesterday for the very purpose of beginning discussions on the final phase and we were able to make that announcement today and we know that it will provide a lot of help to everyone across the country.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that we took some significant steps over the past few days.
We closed the borders to overseas travel on Monday and today, two days later, we announced that we are restricting nonessential travel between Canada and the United States.
This is something that we've been coordinating with the United States on over the past days.
Yesterday, vice president -- deputy Prime Minister Freeland reached out to vice president pence to really advance these negotiations and we're able to announce it in a coordinated fashion on both sides of the border this morning.
This is something that we need to move forward on to protect Canadians.



The next question is from bill curry from the "globe and mail". please go ahead.

Hi, Prime Minister.
We're seeing in the United States some lawmakers are discussing the possibility of sending direct cheques to all Americans as a way of sacrifice targeting those most in need.
But the benefit is it gets there faster and so you've gone with some existing programmes that might involve people dealing with the government and applying for these programmes that could sacrifice speed.
Can you talk about your thought process and going with this route as opposed to something like direct checks that might be simpler?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I know the finance Minister is about to give a press conference in which he will answer many of these questions.
By -- but I can say that we are confident getting these measures out, particularly around e. I. and folks who don't qualify for e. Ism within the next few weeks to compensate for lost income is going to make a significant difference to people who had an income, but have seen it Dr. up over these days because of COVID-19. Many people on pensions or benefits or supports of various types will still receive those supports.
We really wanted to target those people who would lose their income specifically.
We also put on the table significant support for businesses and employers to be able to support their workers, to be able to support their fellow Canadians.
These are the kinds of things that we're moving with both quickly and in a targeted fashion because that is what Canadians expect.



Merci.
Thank you.
The next question is la presser.

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
About the border.
Could you tell us when the border will actually close to nonessential travel and how it will be possible to ensure that you enforce the restriction.
Will you have to bring in the army.
On roxon road, there are still people crossing the border, for example.
First of all, we are working with the United States so that those measures can come into effect very quickly and we'll have more to say about that later.
But it will be happening very soon.
I also want to point out that we do have ways of ensuring that nonessential travelers will not be able to cross the border.
The Canada border services agency has adequate resources to meet that challenge.
Particularly since a lot of people will simply decide to stay home and won't even try to cross the border.
If they're told not to do so. With respect to roxham road, I can re-assure you in saying that every measure has been taken to ensure that that border crossing is properly controlled and the people are put into quarantine for 14 days.



Thank you.
The next question is from heather scofield from Toronto star". please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
In terms of working with the opposition and having to pass some of these steps through them, have you been in touch with the opposition leaders and do you have the assurance that they will cooperate with you to move quickly?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Our house leaders have been working together very closely, both on the house side and on the senate side.
Pablo Rodriguez and Senator park gold have been engaged with all a party leaders both in the house and the senate.
There is broad collaboration.
There is broad openness to moving these measures quickly that will help Canadians who need it. I am confident that this is a moment in which Canadians of all pears will pull together to ensure Canadians get the help they need.




**Interpreter**:

Minister Rodriguez and Senator mark gold are cooperating at this time with their counterparts from the other parties to ensure that we could pass those measures through the house as quickly as possible.
and I can tell you that there is a real desire on the part of the opposition to help Canadians and we are confident that these can go through quickly.
Now personally, I can tell you I'm fine.
The children are fine.
No symptoms as of yet.
Sophie is still dealing with the flu and headaches and so forth.
But she is still Ok. and I want to thank you from the both of My heart for thinking of us all.
Thank you very much.
