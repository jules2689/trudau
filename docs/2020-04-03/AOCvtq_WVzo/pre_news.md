**Rosemary**:

Here we are in the nation's capital.
Obviously parliament not happening now but any moment the prime Minister is expected to address the country again.
From outside his home at riedelcollege where he has been self isolating for almost a week with his family after his wife tested positive for COVID-19. We will be listening closely for details about that temporarily-- temporary closure ofcanada/us border that wereported last night and thepresident confirmed a fewmoments ago.
Remember the details we have sofar on the border closure, anextraordinary measure, the likeof which we haven't seen since9/11, the last time the borderwas deeply affected byrestricted access.
Nonessential travel will be nolonger allowed.
But that goods and trade acrossthe border which of course is ahuge source of economicimportance and to livelihood.
It will continue.
Not clear on how exactly thatwill work so we will hear morefrom the Prime Minister aboutthat.
We are waiting to hear around11:15 or so the details of the25 billion financial aidpackage, that is something thegovernment signalled last weekafter making more creditavailable to the economic systemat large in the system.
It comes on the date whencanada's six major banks saythey will now allow for mortgagepayment deferrals for up to sixmonths.
The measures we are expectingtoday are to target Canadians, individually and families whoare going to feel the impact ofthis or are already feeling it, as some businesses begin to shutdown.
Here's an example, porterairlines says that as of fridayit will no longer be conductingany business, at least untiljune 1st.
Porter flies through most ofeastern Canada and into eastern United states.
If the border is temporarilyclosed border doesn't have areason to go on. So you would imagine the porteremployees would be aiming forfinancial help in the days andweeks ahead.
As we wait for prime ministerjustin trudeau let's bring backand Vassy kapelos, the host ofpower and politics.
We saw last week the financeminister, the governor of thebank of Canada, superintendentof financial institutions, havethis rare and remarkable pressconference where the three ofthem came together withconcerted action, a rate cut, making billions of dollarsavailable to businesses andmaking sure they put liquidityin banks.
That was sort of theunderpinnings of what thegovernment needed to do to makesure the economy was moving.
Today is a little different, much more targeted towardspeople and probably the stuffpeople need to hear directlytoday.



**Reporter**:

I would imagineso.
As you were laying that out Iowas thinking back to Friday an dhow it seems like an eternity ago and how when they made the announcement of $10 billion for small business loans, or credit for small businesses, it seemed like a lot of money and six dayslater, five days later the need shad grown exponentially, is the number of cases of the virus start to grow, nearly exponentially as well.
I think you are right today, what we are expecting is an answer or at least part of an answer to a question we know so many Canadians have.
That is, if I have to stay home because I am sick, because have the virus or just becausei'm not feeling well, or because the message from the federal government now is, unless it is essential you get out of your house to go to work you should be staying inside.
Or if I own a small business and cannot pay My employees? all of those questions we are expecting some sort of ananswer.
I think Canadians need to hear as much as possible from the government what this 25 to30 billion-dollar aid package, stimulus package means for them.
We do know and the united stateshas signalled this that someform of direct payment tocanadians, to our need, especially those at this momentwho are wondering how they willpay their rent or how they willpay for groceries their billsand utilities, some kind ofdirect help through it sounds like programs that are alreadyin existence like the childbenefit or taxes benefit set up. We are expecting something onthat.
How will they get that money toyou, that's the concern, andspeaking of taxes.
It sounds like we will get adeferral, there's a bit of mixmessaging but the prime ministerindicated that it could becoming later this week, butthere are some reports thatthere will be a deferral in taxfiling deadline which was comingup at the end-- very soonactually.
Those are things I think peopleand especially businesses rightnow are counting on informationon and I think that is theexpectation for the pressconference from the Prime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

It such remarkable times.
I say that again and again but it is so unusual how much ishappening, how much has happened over a short period date --short period of time and how the government is responding.
and being significantly testing in how it feels about this.
I don't know how many times you and I and others have talked about the number of crises that have hit the government sincejanuary, is this began it'sfirst minority mandate whether it be the downing of theukrainian plane in Iran, the ongoing blockades around thelng, those stories feel like so long ago and COVID-19 is nowall-encompassing for the countryand for the government as it isfeeling the pressure ofsomething that we are -- we areall experience in worldwide.



**Reporter**:

It's funny we have talked so often sincejanuary about the other crises and they were significant and devastating in so many respects.
But almost incomparable towhat's going on right now.
This is what I think for manycanadians, the idea of government and the roll of government takes on a completely different meaning.
There's always a debate, should government be in your life, should they not and that's valid debate to have a normal circumstances but these are anything but normalcircumstances.
I think you're right to say obviously they are consumed with this and I think Canadians are consumed with trying to figure out how their government will address the problems they are beginning to feel and beginning to face but will only, not getworse, but multiply.
Again thinking back a week when so many people were saying, should I go away or not, and a week later being told you need to get home right now.
That is how fast all of this ischanging, that's how fast the needs of Canadians are changing.
So the government not only Inuits central role will be tested but ability to respond to the needs and that will be monumental challenge.



**Rosemary**:

It is. and hard to judge whether it'sgood decisions or bad decisions being made right now, all we can do is ask them to explain why and hope we can understand at alter date whether things, youknow, were right or wrong.
I'm going to put you on standby for a moment as I go to davidcochrane.
I want to talk to you about part of the news you broke last night around the temporary borderclosure, the president confirmed that is indeed going to happen but he says trade will not beaffected.
I have lots of questions about how this is going to work and idon't think we have many answers



**Reporter**:

Like you I live here now.
and everything is changingmassively.
I don't want to overstate this but it's almost like we are imposing wartime measures and getting on a wartime footing to defeat a viral enemy.
With the government taking enormous action to ramp up resources and protect people as best they can while asking all of us to make enormous sacrifices in our daily lives, to keep each other safe.
Maybe it's simplest tick but when you look at the restrictions on porter and commerce and travel and public movement and large-scalegatherings and working freely, it's truly an unprecedentedpeacetime situation in Canada.
Yesterday what we heard fromprime Minister justin trudeau isthis is what we need you to doand today we will hear from thegovernment this is what we willdo to help you as you are doingthose things.
and to highlight what vassykapelos was saying, the processis like the big message comesfrom the Prime Minister and thenthe mechanics come from theminister, the implementation andthe nitty-gritty of how itworks.
He has this roll of convincingeveryone to follow the publichealth advice, reassure everyonein the time of great anxiety andworry.
I know all of us even though weare coming into work, we allhave families and kids we areworried about and also givesthem hope of what it will belike coming out on the otherside of this.
That's where you are seeing alot of the messages, we willpull together and have a plan torebound as quickly as possible.
The border measures with the ustook more time than bordermeasures with the rest of theworld.
I'm going to stop talkingbecause the Prime Minister iscoming out.



**Rosemary**:

He's coming to the podium to address Canadians.
