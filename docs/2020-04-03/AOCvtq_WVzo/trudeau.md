**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Travellers cannot pick across the border for recreation andtourism.
In both our countries we are encouraging people to stay home.
We are telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours if they don't have to. This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudentapproach.
I want to be clear that essential travel will continue.
Our governments recognize it is critical that we preserve supply chains between both countries.
These supply chains ensure thatfood, fuel and life-savingmedicines reach people on bothsides of the border.
Supply chains including truckingwill not be affected by this newmeasure.
Canadians and americans crossthe border every day to doessential work or for otherurgent resources, that will notbe impacted.

Allcanadians are feeling the consequences of COVID-19. To ensure your safety we are recommending to everyone that they work from home.
To avoid public spaces.
To buy only what they need.
At the grocery store and especially to be kind and empathetic towards those aroundyou.
We must all do our share to protect our health and those of the people around us. [ end of translation ]



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

This is forcing us to change our ways and for many people that'sa huge adjustment.
If you work in a restaurant, drive a cab, organize events or freelance to pay your bills, working from home is not sosimple.
Just like if you work in the oil and gas sector or the tourism and seafood industries, you are looking at the uncertainty and the global economy and wondering not only how long this willlast, but how long you are --how long your savings will last.
No matter who you are or what you do this is a time where you should be focused on your health and that of your neighbours.
Not whether you will lose yourjob.
Not whether you will run out of money for things like groceries and medication.
Last week we announced a whole range of measures to protectjobs, small businesses and theeconomy, from waving the waiting period for employment insurance, sickness benefits to kick in to increasing support for employer sand businesses.
We introduced special measure sunder the work sharing measure to help employers who fall on hard times during COVID-19. If your business faces a cash crunch we will help you into better times.
We are working with our financial crown corporations through the business credit availability program to protect jobs and businesses with$10 billion in credit.

We also said we would be giving you more and that is what brings me here this morning.

In Canada, public health shouldnever hinge on financialconsiderations.

Playing close attention to the economic impacts we make across the board to slow the spread of the virus.
On Monday I announced Canada was closing its air borders to people who are not canadiancitizens or permanent residents with some exceptions.
We also announced a range of other measures of and travel.
But travel restrictions will not apply to commerce or trade.
We are working continuously to ensure the supply of important goods to Canada.
Today, we've announced$27 billion in direct support tocanadian workers and businesses plus 55 billion to meet liquidity needs of canadianbusinesses and households to help stabilize the economy through tax deferrals.
Economic measures will ensure that our economy rebounds afterthis.
and while we are taking significant step today to help families get through these challenging times, our government is prepared to domore.
Whether we are talking about economic travel or healthmeasures, collaboration and coordination remains essential.
Our team is in constant communication with our colleagues in the provinces and territories as well as indigenous leaders and communities to ensure we have coordinated Canada wide approach so we face this and recover from this together.
We are also working with our international counterparts, have spoken to leaders around the world including the fellowg7 leaders.

Of friends setting up online groups to chat.
Of retired nurses and doctors stepping up to help.
Of young people giving a hand to elderly neighbours by dropping off some extra groceries at thedoor.

Here he is back after announcing$27 billion in direct payments to Canadians.
I think you taking questionsnow.



**Reporter**:

Good morning prime Minister.
I'm wondering what assurances you have from president donaldtrump that if this pandemic gets worse he will not close the borders crippling trade and necessary shipments in canadaand also how long do you expect the temporary closure to last, weeks, months?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

We talked about exactly that thismorning, president Donald trump and I, to ensure that indeed our economies and our people that are so interconnected in so many different ways will be able to ensure the smooth flow of good sand essential materials and medication across the border.
That is something that we remain committed to, we will work in close collaboration on an ongoing basis to make sure thatcontinues.
and these measures will last in place as long as we feel they need to last.
We will again closely coordinate on that as well.



**Reporter**:

[ speakingfrench ] on the border with theus, how can you in concreteterms ensure that people willnot come in and infect peoplehere, from those sights ofinfection and how can you ensurethat the border will remain openfor the free flow of goods andmaterials?



**Voice of Translator**:

We are working closely with the United States at this time to introduce specific rules that will keep both Canadians and americanssafe.
We understand that it is very important for the border to remain open because we are talking about $2 billion worth of goods that cross the border every single day.
It is critical, not just for the health of our economy but for the health of our citizens if that continues to be the case.
We will be looking at this issue to ensure those measures protectcanadians while at the same time allowing us to bring in the goods we need.
With respect to the duration, how long this will last, we will continue to do it as long as Otis necessary, while at the same time coordinating the situation between our countries.
[ end of translation ]



**Reporter**:

With all these economic measures being announced is it inevitable we are heading into a recession?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Right now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting income or revenue because of this COVID-19challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, topay their rent, to support theirfamilies through these difficulttimes.
We recognize that manybusinesses are closed, manyworkplaces are significant --having significant slowdowns ifnot stoppages.
That's having economic impact.
We know the fundamentals of thecanadian economy are strong andin a number of weeks or monthsor however long it takes, oncewe get rolling again thecapacity of the federalgovernment to invest in theeconomy, to support businessesand individuals will ensure webounce back strongly.
We have the fiscal room to dothis because of prudentdecision-making over the pastfive years, we will be able to ensure that our economy getsback up to speed quickly.



**Reporter**:

[ speakingfrench ] good morning mrtrudeau, today you areannouncing billions of dollarsfor Canadians.
It is probably more easy toannounce than actually to do it. When will Canadians be receivingthat money?



**Voice of Translator**:

We are talking about a few weeks for the aid checks to be produced, particularly for those who don'tqualify for ei. There are legislative measures that are needed so we are working with the other parties who are fully cooperating with us in order for us to pass the measures through the house of commons I get the money out.
But the money is being done now, in fact even before the housereturns, so that we can get the money to people as quickly as possible so they have it when they need it. [ please stand by ]



**Reporter**:

Mr. Prime Minister, you rolled out or talked about a lot of economic and stimulus measures that you are putting into force.
What kind of reassurances can you give to Canadians at this time that the government has the infrastructure in place and the people in place, considering the daily bread food banksingive Rex -- the directive that this will roll out in a timely and efficient manner.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There are many families across this country who are looking at their sources of income Dr. up because of COVID-19. Many of them qualify for e. I. and we're making sure that with the elimination of the one-week waiting per, that money will be able to flow significantly and quickly to them.
Many families do not qualify for e. I. many workers do not qualify and, therefore, we're putting in place exceptional measures that will flow money to them every two weeks.
Our capacity to do this is something that we have spent a lot of time over the past days insuring because we know that that could make the difference not just between one family facing tougher times or not, but it could make a difference on the health of all Canadians.
People need to be able to self-isolate.
Need to be able to stay home.
Need to be able to care for their families when their ordinary sources of revenue Dr. up. That is why we're putting forward $27 million in direct supports to Canadians and businesses.
That is why we're moving forward on freeing up $55 billion that will stay in the economy because of delayed tax payments to make sure that people can cover the things they need to in the coming days.
Along with all of our extra measures for shelters, for indigenous communities, through the Canada child benefit and others that will ensure that Canadians have the confidence that they will be Ok.through this difficult time.
Because we are all in this together and we are there for you.
