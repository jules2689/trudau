**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Good morning, everyone.
Yesterday I shared with you that My wife Sophie was being tested for COVID-19 and that test did come back positive.
Sophie's symptoms remain mild, but we're following medical advice and taking every precaution.
She will remain in isolation's for the time being.
We are thinking about all the families across the country who have received the same diagnosis.
But we're in good hands.
We have full confidence in Canada's health officials and professionals.
This means that, upon My doctor's recommendation, I will remain in self-isolation for 14 days.
I want to be clear -- I have no symptoms and I'm feeling good and technology allows me to work from home.
Of course, it's an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating.
We are all social beings, after all.
But we have to do this.
Because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with preexisting conditions.
We are following medical advice as should all Canadians.
On that note, I want to thank all of Canada's health professionals and the public health agency who are doing an incredible job supporting and looking after all of us. 



**Interpreter**:

[inaudible] had become tested for COVID-19 and tested positive.
and we are taking all possible precautions.
She will, therefore, remain in self-isolation.
For an indeterminant period.
We are thinking as well about Canadians across the country who received the same diagnosis.
We are in good hand and have full confidence in health care professionals and health care officials hooer in Canada.
That means that following the recommendation of My own physician, I will be in self-isolation for 14 days.
I want to be clear.
I have no symptoms.
I feel very well and I'm working from home out of precaution.
Technology allows us to work at home and of course it is not ideal and somewhat frustrating.
After all, we're all social beings.
and it is something that we must dos in order to protect our friends and neighbours.
Particularly the most vulnerable people and people who have underlying medical conditions.
We are following medical advice like all Canadians should be doing right now.
I want to take this opportunity to thank all health care professionals and the public health agency of Canada, which is doing exemplary work.
I now want to tell you what Canada will be doing to ensure your safety and security and protect your health.
Yesterday I had a discussion with a number of international leaders, including president trump of the United States, Prime Minister johnson and Prime Minister conti in italy.
I also took part of the meeting of the special cabinet committee meeting on COVID-19 and I had telephone conversations with finance ministers with respect to the current economic situation.
I had an opportunity to speak to the chamber of commerce president and the president of the c. L.c. This morning, I had a cabinet meeting and spoke to president macron of france.
Those discussions will continue in the coming days.
Earlier today, ministers blair, hajdu did announce hat we are recommending that Canadians avoid all nonessential travel outside the country.
We also announced that the cruise ship season will be suspended until July and we will be tightening control measures at airports.
We will be looking to better control international passengers arriving in Canada.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Announced that Canadians have been told to curtail nonessential international travel and the cruise season is suspended until July.
and we are bringing in additional screening measures at airports.
We are also streamlining overseas arrivals to be better positioned for screeningful yesterday we saw many provinces take strong steps to keep people safe.
They are doing what needs to be done to protect the public and I want to thank them for their exemplary work.
Later today I'll have a call with premiers to discuss the latest developments and co-ordinate our efforts including the over $1 billion COVID-19 response fund which provides money to the province and territories to support preparation and mitigation.
These are significant steps and we will do more.
The provinces and territories are facing various levels of risk, but we will make sure that we align our response across country.
Ed dressing COVID-19 must be a team Canada effort.
To keep Canadians safe and mitigate the economic impacts of the virus, all levels of government are working together.
We are talking regularly, coordinating efforts and following the situation very closely and we're pulling out all the stops.
I know that you're worried.
You're worried about your health and about your family's health.
About your job, your savings, about paying rent.
About the kids not being in school.
I know you are concerned about uncertainty in the global economy.
The steps being taken to keep you safe have an economic impact.
What is also true is that we're in the enviable position of having significant fiscal fire power available to support you.
This is in addition to the measures we've already taken.
The finance Minister is also in constant communication with his international counterparticipates to find ways to work together, to mitigate the impacts of the virus on the global economy.
We will have further announcements shortly this afternoon a. The agreement we reached with other parties to suspend the house today also gives us the flexibility to do the things we need to do in order to support Canadians.
No one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries or additional child care because of COVID-19. The government of Canada will be introducing a significant fiscal stimulus package in the days ahead.




**Interpreter**:

The government of Canada will be announcing a significant fiscal stimulation's package in the coming days.
I know there are many of you who are worried.
Worried for you and the health of your families.
We are doing everything we must do to protect our economy and we are in a very advantageous fiscal position.
All orders of government are working together to stop the spread of the virus.
Businesses and citizens like you are all taking precautions.
Here in Canada, we have health care professionals who are incredible and doing an incredible job.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Businesses and citizens are taking pretautions.
We have outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job.







**Interpreter**:

You talked about measures to limit the number of foreign travelers coming in to Canada.
Could you be more specific.
What exactly are you thinking of? do you mean the number of flights? will you be targeting specific countris? people are concerned that this may be concerned if they're coming in from another country.
What will you be doing? we're working on the specific measures but I can tell you that we're reducing the number of airports that will be bringing in international passengers in order to better streamline those passengers and assess them to ensure the safety of Canadians.
We are also looking at the origins of flights and travel to determine if other steps are required and we will be working every single day to ensure safe travel.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We will give the proper resource on all arrivals to ensure that we're doing everything we can to keep Canadians and Canada safe.
We're obviously looking at countries of origin and further measures that we can take.
We will make those decisions on the best science, the best recommendations of our health officials.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

is one of the options the possibility of closing the border to certain criteria and what would you apply? the number of cases in Canada or that sort of thing? well, our assessment criteria are entirely based on the recommendations of experts and our health care professionals.
We have full confidence in health care authorities here and around the world and we will be following their recommendations.
We will not be ruling out any possible step.
We will continue to do the work that we've been doing for weeks now, to keep Canadians safe and that will continue.



Prime Minister Trudeau's we will continue to make decisions based on recommendations of medical experts, public health authorities and top scientists.
We understand we have taken significant measures over the past weeks and months to ensure that Canadians are kept safe and slow the spread of the virus.
We will continue to make determinations about how best to do that based on recommendations of experts.
We're not closing the door to any further steps, but we will make those decisions based on what science tells us.



**Reporter**:

Nelson Mandela, sir.
"national post", sir.
The financial markets had two of their worst days on record this week.
You talk about the government's fiscal power.
Why haven't we used it yet and what are you planning to do?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Two days ago, we announced a billion-dollar plan to invest in health and support Canadians across the country.
We've also put forward measures that will strengthen e. Ism and hope Canadians.
We recognize there is much more to do. We do not want any canadian to have to worry about whether or not they will be able to pay their rent or whether or not they will be able to buy groceries or care for their kids.
Or elderly family members.
We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.
That is what we're focused on and we'll be rolling out those measures in the coming days.
The finance Minister will make further announcements later today on concrete measures to support our economy.
But further to that, in conversations with My fellow g-7 leaders, we have agreed it will be important for us to co-ordinate at a g-7 level to impact the economy.
We'll be following up on those in the coming days as well.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] affected industris?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are looking at ways to help Canadians directly, yes.
Particularly vulnerable Canadians who are going to be particularly squeezed if they don't get -- aren't able to go to work.
These are the kinds of things we're focused on. We also know that small businesses may struggle through or will struggle through this period of economic slowdown, of people choosing to stay at home and protect their families.
We will look at how to support them so that once we get through this difficult time our economy and Canadians will continue to prosper.




**Interpreter**:

We are looking at how we can provide direct support to Canadians who are in more difficult situations.
Because of not having any paycheque.
We know that can have a severe effect on the ability to pay rents or look after their children or seniors to put food on the table.
So, we will be taking direct steps to support Canadians in difficulty and we'll also look to help small and medium-sized businesses that will be facing a number of difficult weeks as we respond to the threat of this virus.
We will also be announcing measure this is afternoon through the Minister of finance and, as well, early next week with additional measures to directly help Canadians.



Obviously we wish good health to all Canadians.
But if you are to fall ill, members of your cabinet, for instance, what is the plan for governing?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have continued to engage.
I've been very busy both yesterday and today, we'll continue to work from home remotely to do the important things that need to be done to keep Canadians safe.
We have an exceptional cabinet working hard on all of these issues as well.
We have extraordinary public servants working as well.
We'll don't do the work that needs to be done to keep Canadians safe while following all directions by our public health officials.



**Reporter**:

I don't think that indicates if there was a contingency plan in place if you were to fall sick.
I'm also wondering why public health officials told you why you don't need to be tested.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all, there's always been contingency plans for ministers who are sick or even a Prime Minister who has fallen ill.
We'll continue to follow all of those correct contingency plans.
For now, I'm continuing to work extremely hard from home.
In terms of advice I've gotten from medical professionals, it was explained to me that as long as I do not show any symptoms at all, there is no value in having me tested.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

I'm following the recommendations of public health authorities who explained to me as long as I don't have any symptoms of the coronavirus, there is no point in being tested.
Yes, but there are Canadians who may be wondering.
You're in good shape.
We know that.
But you may have the coronavirus without having symptoms.
Now you are still sharing the same home as your wife Sophie.
Why will you not be tested systematically every single day? well, the advice of experts and physicians is that, as long as I have no symptoms or feeling any symptoms, there is no point in testing me. Now we understand that Sophie Trudeau came back last weekend.
I know that you met with a lot of people last weekend in Toronto and Ottawa all week.
Are you not afraid that you may have been a vector of transmission of the virus? well, we did discuss that with the health -- public health authorities.
and the fact that I have no symptom and show no symptom whatsoever of the coronavirus means, according to them, there is no risk for the people I might have worked with over those days.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

According to health officials, the fact that I have expressed absolutely no symptoms means that anyone I engaged with this week has not been put at risk.



**Reporter**:

I'm wondering, given the warnings that Canada has given about traveling abroad, should Canadians still be traveling between provinces and cities, given how different the virus is spreading within Canada?



Prime Minister Trudeau's I think people need to make responsible decisions and check with their medical professionals and their own travel plans.
I know that Canadians will listen to the advice of experts and make decisions that are appropriate for them and their family.
Roher can you describe specifically what your self-isolation means both for you and your family and your wife? you're outside right now.
is your wife still going outside? is your family still going outside? what does self-isolation actually mean for your family?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We, as are many, many Canadians right now, following very carefully the advice that public health professionals are telling us in terms of what we can do and shouldn't do.



**Reporter**:

What does that mean?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

That means I am in isolation as are My children and My wife is in quarantine.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, in your conversation with president trump yesterday, was there any discussion about future access of Canadians to cross the United States border and should the situation worsen.
and do you have any concerns given the United States slow response to this, about Americans coming here?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have been working very closely with our counterparts in the United States to co-ordinate our efforts at the border and to align our efforts.
There is certainly ongoing conversations that will continue to be had as the situation evolves, but I'm confident we'll continue to wonger closely with the americans to keep people in north america safe, particularly to keep Canadians safe.
On that, it is worth noting that it was one piece of good news that comes out of this wall streeting is that the new nafta has now been fully passed and ratified and is now awaiting royal ascents which should happen quickly.



**Reporter**:

Can you describe your situation domestically here in a little more detail.
is your wife here in this house, are all three kids sneer if so, a question that a lot of Canadians are dealing with, how are you going to keep them occupied for the next two weeks?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Most of the morning, kids have been doing Lego and the -- My wife has been on the phone to friends and family.
I've been on the phones with macron and cabinet and officials and members of My team as we work to keep Canadians safe.



**Reporter**:

What is your single biggest concern about Canada's preparedness at this point?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

My concern is that Canadians continue to follow the directions of public health authorities.
We have to be alert and responsible.
We don't want to panic.
But we don't want to take this too lightly, either.
Finding that middle ground is always going to be challenging by have tremendous confidence that Canadians will be able to.



What are you telling your children about the heightened sense of concern in the country and also how are you explaining some of the political decisions that you are making?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are obviously having some very good conversations with our kids about what is going on, about how not to be overly concerned but a little bit concerned, which is obviously why they are home today with us. We're going to continue to have thoughtful conversation as partners across the country will be having with their kids.



Last question.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, good afternoon.
I just wondering if you could walk us through the logic that Canada's ha not gone through the step of restrixing international travels.
That we don't agree with science in those countries or the experts in those countries that vain for such a move.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Different countries will have experts that give them advice that is suitable for their own situation.
We have followed the instructions and the advice and recommendations of our public health officials.
We will recall in the number of weeks ago in the beginnings there was a discussion about whether or not we should entirely close our borders to china the way the United States did.
and there is a way that has allowed for control and non spread of the virus that gives us confidence that our public health officials are giving us the right recommendations for Canada.



and on the fiscal stimulus package that is coming out, is that in place of the budget? it's just kind of a series of what we could expect now through the end of this crisis.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are obviously focused primarily on how we're going get money into the pockets of Canadians who will need it because of this situation.
That work will continue.
But our focus right now is on ensuring that Canadians have the resources and the money to not have to stress about rent and about groceries and child care and elder care at a time where they are also very worry about their health and their family's health.
We will be supporting the economy and Canadians through this time.




**Interpreter**:

Our priority remains now about the health and well-being of Canadians.
We don't want them to worry about how to pay their mortgage or rent or feed their children or look after their parents.
We will do everything we need to do to help them and for weeks now, and months now, with respect to the budget.
Well, those discussions are continuing.
But right now our priority is to help Canadians that are suffering.



**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada walking back into his home.
At Rideau cottage, which is not far from Rideau hall where he will be with his family for the next 14 days, self-isolating after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus.
He says he is feeling well and his wife is now in quarantine inside the house with just mild symptoms.
Public health officials tell him he has not have to get tested give than he is not exhibiting any symptoms.
An extraordinary moment for the Prime Minister at an extraordinary time in this country.
As the number of confirmed cases goes up really by the hour.
We are now somewhere close to more than 170 confirmed cases in Canada.
Let me bring in Vassy kapelos, the host of "power & politics" listening in there with me as well.
Probably the most important sort of news that we got from the Prime Minister, other than his own health news, is that there will be a significant fiscal stimulus package announced soon.
I don't know if it is going to be this afternoon with the finance Minister, but we are going to see some big moves from the government.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I sounded to me that the finance Minister would be announcing thing this is afternoon that are directed mostly toward what you and aw ere discussing before the press conference of people who have to stay home because they're sick or taking care of their kid and may be worried about paying the bills.
He also left the door open to direct payments to Canadians as well and said that is something that they were definitely not ruling out.
The if is cal stimulus, you're absolutely right.
That is the big headline out of that aside from the personal health concerns and those of his family.
The idea that in the coming days that stimulus will be coming down.
and we've been talking to economists all week who have sort of quantified if you want stimulus to work, it has to be about 1% of g. D.p., which equates to somewhere around the $20 to $40 billion mark.
It is a big chunk of change and will also be super interesting to see in what way does that stimulus work because it is not a conventional 2008 type of recession.
On the one hand you're telling everyone to stay home and not spend your money.
Stimulus is designed to do the opposite.
It will certainly be a difficult line to walk and definitely something to watch over the coming days.



**Rosemary**:

and the other thing about stimulus t better you get it going t better it is. I'm going to put you on hold for one moment while I bring in Dr. Michael gardham of humbler river hospital in Toronto.
He joins me now.
Thank you for standing by with us. You were listening to the Prime Minister.
You may have heard earlier comments from Dr. Tam all saying that nonessential travel should be canceled for Canadians as well as moves coming in from foreign countries and cruise ship season postponed until July 1. How significant are these measures in terms of the change that we have seen and the way this country is handing I.



There are huge changes.
You think a week ago a, Canada was living in a bit of a bubble, thinking this was all travel-related and now clearly we're taking measures to slow down the local spread of the disease, which is absolutely critical and, like a stimulus package, you need to do this early.
You need to do it now.



**Rosemary**:

and did they wait too long or does it seem to you to be the right time?



It definitely needed to happen this week.
and I think they still need to do more, to be honest with you.
I think that the other big group which hasn't been talked about yet for most universities is actually closing universities a going online.
You want to try to limit the amount of interaction that any one person has with people all day.



**Rosemary**:

and let mes ask SK you a personal question about the Prime Minister.
He's saying he shouldn't be tested yet.
That is what his people are telling him.
I find that surprising but I don't know anything about medicine so maybe you can tell me whether you think that makes good sense.



I love it when people in power say listen to your doctor.
and he is saying what I would say as well.
We don't test asymptomatic people at this point.
The fact he is living with somebody who has this, the moment he develops symptoms and, yes, he should be tested.
But we are not testing contacts of people.



**Rosemary**:

That is why I have a doctor with me and not pretend to know things myself.
One last question.
In terms of how people's behavior changes over the next number of weeks, school closures in Ontario and in Quebec, what will that do to flatten that curve that we've all been talk about over the past week?



It has the potential to have a massive impact Ana stress that enough.
Italy has gotten into severe trouble because they did not do this.
We really need every Canadian to be mindful of what you're doing during the day and how can you decrease the amount of exposure we have with other people.
If we do that, we won't get into the trouble that Italy got into.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Vassy, a imgoing to go back to you, if you don't mind.
I wanted to get some medical advice there because --



**Vassy**:

Not from me.



**Rosemary**:

Not from you, not from me. That was helpful.
Why the Prime Minister would not have been tested yet and the potential for flattening the curve, which basically means to contain the number of cases that happen across the country.
There were questions there, too, to the Prime Minister about why they are not going even further in terms of closing the border.
From the scientific reports that I raid over the past number of days, that doesn't do much more than slow the outbreak.
I wonder what kind of pressure is happening with the pressure from the United States.



**Vassy**:

My understanding is that the call that took place between the president and Prime Minister yesterday didn't involve a lot of pressure from the United States, around that.
I was told there was a lot of agreement over let's work together.
I think the pressure in from My understanding, from My conversations with people close to the decision-makers on that, the pressure is coming from within and that is because of the spread of the disease actually in the United States.
In particular.
Not as much from china or iran where it is prevalent.
Because of all the concerns over the limited number of testing in the United States and the handling of the spread of the virus there, as we've seen over the past 24 hours, an increase in incidents here, not from the countries I named, but instead from the United States, a number of cases particularly in Ontario, both yesterday and today are people who have traveled to the United States and come back.
and so there is increased pressure on the federal government to do more where the border is concerned there.
I actually thought that though the announcement was made by the transport Minister and the Prime Minister, they are going to limit the number of airports for some flights.
Minister garneau used the word "overseas" and Prime Minister trudeau used the word "international." what does that mean? that is necessary in order for experts to assess when those measures are going to do the job.



**Rosemary**:

I have to leave you there for a moment.
Thank you for that.
Just want to say good-bye to the people watching on the main network.
[please stand by]joining us



**Rosemary**:

David Cochrane is joining us and we were talking about this stimulus package versus what we may hear from the finance minister later today.
It probably won't be the entire fiscal package and the Prime Minister said that we'd hear more about that in the coming days but there may be measures here for people who are, forinstance, wondering what the heck am I going to do with my kids for the next number of weeks if you're in a province where schools are closed.



**Reporter**:

To give you sense of how they're preparing with this, and I spoke to an official about this the other day and they have phases.
You don't want to do your entirety of your economic response because things change.
Just from the ability to be flexible and respond to the changing dynamic caused by the economic Connecticut stagian.
and if you have nothing new to add it freaks people out.
So we'll hear from bill more to calm everybody down and announce measures based on what the Prime Minister just said.
Everything they're looking at with cash transfers directly tocanadians.
Nobody should worry about their rent or jobs or medicine or daycare during this point intime.
and for parents, for example, who are worried, they already have a direct cash transfer that goes into their bank accounts in the Canada child benefit sothere's an instrument where you would know that it goes straight to families.
That's My speculation and not government policy.
But to give you a sense of how much room they have, vassytalked about the stimulus to be$20 billion to $40 billion to have and to get a bit of math, they could spend $40 billion and still keep the debt-to-g. D.p. Track going in the directionthat it wants it to go. and this will probably go beyondthat and you're dealing with apandemic and COVID-19 is in theearly stages in Canada but theyhave room to really blow thebudget completely if they needto.
You'll move off some of thefiscal targets they set but a g7country like Canada with itseconomy can bear that burden.
So that's the message they havebeen sending to the messages toothat we'll back stop you on themedical need and we'll deploy asneeded and, speaking withanother senior official too, rosie, the other night --they've compared the situationas it's emerging to the2008-2009 global financialcrisis and the h1n1 pandemic atthe same time.
That's kind of what we'redealing with in terms of theeconomic and the health impactsof this.
and, you know, justin trudeau isright when he says that wequibble about the deficit, andcanada's books are good enoughto really infuse serious cashinto the economy and intocanadians' wallets if that'swhat it takes and the signals iswhat it's going to take andprepared to do that and we'llhear from the finance ministerand that is at 2:00.



**Rosemary**:

I should say thatthere's different conversations happening on a global level to deal with the economy as well, this is not just a canadaproblem but g7 leaders saidthey'd have a video conference on Monday to do that.
and the United States president is speaking later this afternoon.
U.s. Media reporting that he islikely to say that there is anational state of emergencywhich unlocks a bunch of moneyunder fema.
So there's different measuresthat different countries aretaking and we'll, as you say, learn more about the financialmeasures later this afternoon.
David, we'll come back to you.
Catherine cullen is at Rideau --outside of Rideau cottage wherei thought that david was but it's catherine there so that'sgood.
I will talk to you more aboutwhat the Prime Minister said, particularly around -- I guesshow he is coping with things andhow his government is copingwith things in terms of theircapacity to do their work.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, well, it was interesting.
I was asking him, for instance, what the plan was if he fall sill and, obviously, none of us can read his mind, Rosie, but immediately he didn't engage with that, right? he wanted to put the emphasis on the fact that he's still working and we than he talked yesterday with Donald trump and the Prime Minister of Italy and the fact that he's still in constant meetings on top of this crisis.
and when he was pushed a littlebit, is there a contingency plan in place and he didn't engage and he said of course there'salways contingency plans inplace.
I thought what was the most interesting takeaway from the news conference is that he did not give much information.
Virtually everything that we heard from Justin Trudeau we just heard from his ministers moments before.
So what was the reason that he came out in front of his house today to speak to Canadians? all under the umbrella ofreassurance, right, to reassurecanadians broadly that everyone is working in tandem on this and while this is a difficultsituation, things are to some extent under control.
That this is something thatcanadians will get through and to offer reassurances about hi sown health as well.
As you heard there were a lot of questions about how he'smanaging and whether or not he might fall ill himself, why hehasn't been tested.
So I think that the very act of standing in front of rideaucottage and talking to canadiansthat was the big takeaway here.



**Rosemary**:

I think you'reright for that.
Catherine Cullen in Ottawa rightnow.
and as Catherine mentioned these are the ministers who are out taking a lot more questions about the details about the important announcements made just before the prime ministerspoke.
That is the deputy Prime Minister.
Let's listen in live to the ministers now.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Around all international travel, all travel outside of Canada bycanadians.
and, you know, I think that all of us need to -- all of us incanada, need to listen very carefully to that public healthadvice.
You guys heard it just a few minutes ago.
The advice is, you know, that we should -- all of us should avoidnon-essential travel outside ofcanada.



Thank you.
I think that it's an excellentquestion.
What we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders.
a border is not going to contain the virus.
Borders are important measures though for making sure that people have information about what to do when they're in particular country should they find themselves ill.
In our case, the information that we have been providing since we first became aware of the illness was information about what local public health numbers are available in jurisdictions so no matter who is travelling, regardless whether it's domestic travel or international travel, that they have appropriate information to reach out to public healthofficials.
It's really important to remember this, because I think that Canadians think that we can stop this at the border.
and we see a pandemic meaning that border measures are highly ineffective and in some case scan create harm.
We see that in countries with the worst expression, who have the tightest borders.
If I point to our dear friends in Italy, in fact, as you recall they had some very early restrictions on internationaltravel.
In fact, shutting down borders.
What they found is an escalation of cases because borders don'tstop travellers and travellers find other ways into countries and travellers about being less honest about where they've come from and where they'retravelling to, what their particular symptoms may be. So Canada's approach from the beginning has been to use science and evidence to make these decisions to keepcanadians safe.
The reason why we took the measures early on was because the science says that when you provide the screening and the information at the border, especially as you understand how the pandemic is travelling across the globe, that you can actually have those conversations with travellers.
You can actually follow thosetravellers, depending on the severity of the illness in their particular country which we have done at local public healthlevels.
You can track and even consider -- and we have -- add adding mandatory isolation.
Now that we see cases in Canada, borders become less important.
and the relationship with the United states is going to be critically important so we can continue that work together because we have people withcoronavirus in the United States.
and we have people withcoronavirus in Canada.
and undoubtedly we have people with coronavirus in Mexico.
So those conversations as Continent are going to be what continues to keep us safe.
Thank you.



As a follow-up, I think thisis for Minister blair andminister garneau.
If we could get a little moredetail about the screening thatwill happen at airports forarrivals.
What will that screening entail? will it be for all internationaltravellers and would that alsoapply to land border crossingswith the United States?



Yes, as I have indicated, we have quite recently implemented enhanced screening measures at all land, rail and marine points of entry which are primarily coming from the United States, not exclusively, but primarily.
We've focused our resources particularly at people who are travelling from regions that have been identified by our public health officials as tier level 3 regions where there's higher risk of infection in those regions.
and they are subject to screening if, for example, they have been to a high risk area and they receive certaininformation.
If they are in need of further interaction with our public health officials, the referral takes place right at theairport.
We provide those international travellers with additional information should they become symptomatic or feel ill and they get public health advice at point of entry.
I think that it's very, veryimportant.
and for those individuals as well who may be symptomatic andthere's a referral to public health authorities so that they may begin the important process of self-isolation or quarantineas required.
So that those steps are beingtaken and there's a very closecoordination taking place todayat all of our points of entry, particularly the internationalones from the affected regions.
Between our border serviceagents and public health.
and they're in constantcommunication.
a very important part of ourresponsibility there isscreening for those who are atrisk.
But it's also information as thehealth nister said to providepeople with information so theycan take the right steps to keepthemselves and their familiesand their neighbours safe whenthey return to this country.
and at the same time, as we haveheard from the public healthofficials today, Dr. Tam, we areadvising people to avoid allunnecessary travel andparticularly to internationaldestinations and I think that itis important to advise not onlycanadians as they travel abroadbut from others who choose tocome Tom Canada, they avoidunnecessary travel, non-essential travel to thiscountry.
If they have to come here theywill be subject to significantlyenhanced screening.
We're consulting withstakeholders and our authoritiesacross the country looking atways in which we can manage this in the most efficient waypossible.
We know the important work thatpublic health officials areconducting for Canadians rightacross the country.
and we know that there's bordersecurity officers doing anoutstanding job in providingthose services and protectingthe best interests of Canadians.
We want to make sure that weutilize those resources mostefficiently and effectively forthe safety of Canadians.



I'm going to actually ask aquestion.
That was one of the conditions that I put on the table for this press conference today.
My question is for you, I'mwondering if you can speak in Little bit -- or actually in much detail -- about what social distancing looks like? because even among friends andfamily, I think that the whole notion is creating a lot of anxiety for people about, youknow, you guys are all kind of huddled up on the stage here.



I know.

---

**Question**:

So can you describe--[laughter]



Two arm lengths.

---

**Question**:

So should people go to social gatherings? can you offer us some concrete and Canadians some concrete guidance on what social distancing should look like? I know that no big parties but what about smaller gatherings offamily? people are wondering about this.



Okay, so going back to thescience, the idea behind social distancing and this two-metrerule is that we know that themain mode of transmission of thevirus is through droplets and ifsomeone is sick and coughing, the furtherest they can coughand have the droplets land onthe ground or hopefully not hitsomeone is up to two metres.
and the way that we haveexplained it and with otherauthorities across country istwo arm lengths.
So that's two metres.
So people can still get togetherbut maintain that generaldistance and not be sort ofwithin hugging distance and ithink that is what socialdistancing is all about.
and I think that is why alsomany public health authoritiesare recommending no massgathering events.
The number itself is not thatcritical, 250 has been putforward and I think that isreasonable.
I think that it's just theprinciple of reinforcing withpeople that, you know, obviouslythe government can do what itcan in terms of beingprescriptive in certain ways, you know, mass gathering eventsand that you cannot hold them, but I think that common sensefor many people, the types ofsmall parties that people willhave.
If you maintain that as ageneral rule and as we saidbefore, maybe no handshakes orhugging or kissing but maybeit's the elbow bump, and it's agood way to go forward.
Of course as we said many timesbefore, we cannot repeat enoughtimes to wash your handsfrequently.
If you become ill, don't go to the party and stay at home.
Don't go to work and just coughetiquette.
So those things still stand.

---

**Question**:

I do have technical question and I know that in public health you don'tnormally talk about individual sand have their names and in this case we're talking about sophiegrÉgoire Trudeau because that'sbeen made public that she'stested positive.
She recently was travelling internationally and she had flown to London.
She was with the Prime Minister's mother, margarettrudeau.
Typically Minister hajdu, you had talked about contacting people who may have been around passenger who was later identified to have COVID-19. Sorry for the personal nature of this question because we know who it is, but is that work underway to try and to let other passengers on the flight to know that she indeed tested positive? and also if Margaret Trudeau is in self-isolation as well, if weknow about that.



I'll say a few words and then turn it over to the doctor.
But first of all, there's no evidence that someone needs toself-isolate if, in fact, theyhave been in contact withsomeone who is a-symptomatic andso it's important to rememberthat.
That's why the prime ministerhas received that public healthadvice that he doesn't have to have a test.
He is, of course, self-isolatingout of a degree of precautionbecause he's had close contactwith someone who is positive.
But should he remaina-symptomatic for 14 days he'dbe considered to not have thecovid-19 disease.
As well, yes, the descriptionthat you're providing isactually what contact tracinglooks like.
So now what will happen with thepositive case and given that ourcases are still so low in thiscountry, we still have thepublic health capacity to dothis work.
This is also important toremember.
Now public health will do thecontact tracing for madamgrÉgoire trudeau.
and it will interview her aboutwho she's been in contact withand who she's spoken with, as well as secure the manifest ofthe plane to talk to people thatwere within that two metreradius of her to determine ifthey are feeling symptomatic andto ask them to take precautionsaround self-isolation.
I will turn it to the doctor ifyou want to add anything.



I think that you said it verywell, Minister.
I don't know the details and we leave that to the public health authorities due to the very detailed contact tracing.
Starting with the interview with the Prime Minister's wife.
and so the key point is to determine who she's been in contact with after she begansymptoms.
So to me it's not clear.
I don't know personally as to when she began to feel ill with this on the flight orafterwards? if it was after the flight, then really the people around her on that flight would not be considered at risk.
If it was becoming ill on theflight, then, obviously, the steps would be taken as we have done for other cases.
It has been I think a point of discussion with the special advisory committee, theusefulness.
Because to date no more case shave been served for those who have done the contacttraisessing.
So in terms of public health resources and what is the best use of public health resources, and contact tracing on airplanes versus a lot of other things that they could or should be doing and that's still something that we're looking at. We're obviously looking at the evidence based on the cases thatwe've had so far and we'll put our best foot forward in terms of future cases that might have that sort of air flightcomponent.



I'll go to Raymond fill on and then Kelsey Johnson with Reuters.

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): question for minister garneau.
Premier legault in quÉbec is asking the federal government to limit foreign entries intocanada, foreign visitors tocanada.
is that part of your plan?



**(Voice of Translator)**:

We are constantly monitoring thesituation.
Our priority is to have the health and well-being ofcanadians.
So everything is on the table atany given time.
and we know that the situationis evolving and the discussionsare ongoing.
If at a certain point we decideto take additional measures ofcourse we will announce them.
But, you know, that's somethingthat could happen but it's notnecessarily in our plans.
I'll just say that we'remonitoring the situation.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): why is it not part of your plans now?



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Well, as we have said from the beginning we are being very well advised by health experts and we know that they are monitoring the situation on behalf of allcanadians.
So we are being guided by what they tell us. That doesn't mean that we're not looking at other options andwe'll just have to see in the coming days what happens.
But for the moment, what we'veannounced or just the measures that we believe to be necessary at this time.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Perhaps I could add a few words.
I can't comment on what premierlegault said, but I work very closely with our provincial and territorial counterparts, including the chief medical officer of quÉbec.
and we've looked at, you know, what is the best targeted measures are.
As we said before, borders don'tstop viruses.
You could have a-symptomaticpeople crossing the border andthen have symptoms only afterthey have entered the country.
So it's more important to have awell-managed public healthsystem that is able to identifyand isolate cases quickly.
and so far what we have seenthat we have been able to dothat.
and we also need Canadians to beaware of the situation.
So if they go abroad and comeback, they need to be able toself-monitor.
That's very important that theydo that for the 14 days afterthey are returning to Canada.
and then they need to contactlocal authorities if they dofeel sick.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

My question is foryou.
Have any labs that are not directly owned by a government sought approval for the laboratory developed tests? and when might health Canada be able to approve the first test kits as medical devices?



We'll have to get back to you on that.
What I can say is that for lab testing in Canada, as we allknow, the initial test was first done by our national microbiology laboratory incanada.
and over time certainly the goal is to basically to be be able to expand for lab testing throughout the country.
So by experience, one-by-one ithink that the provinces --first British Columbia andontario because of theirexperience -- have what we nowcall a validated test.
At the provincial level.
Now Alberta has joined them andquÉbec as well.
and so in terms of otherlaboratories, certainly, theycan use certain testingmethodologies, obviouslyapproved by health Canada.
There's colleagues who regulatethis.
But in terms of the finalconfirmation, why one of thelaboratories has a validatedtest.
and it's laboratories in quÉbecand British Columbia and albertaand Ontario.



We have to wrap this up.



[indiscernible]

---

**Question**:

Just on the health kits part -- do you know when we might be approving the first test kits as medical devices?



I can't speak to that.
I'm not with health Canada, I'mwith the public health agency ofcanada, and we'll get back to you with further information in terms of test kits.
As you say, they might be submitted for approval.

---

**Question**:

This is myfollow-up, it's not clear to meright now, does Canada considerthe United States as a high riskcountry for transmission ofcovid-19?



We are considering all travel outside of Canada to be considered high risk forcanadians right now for tworeasons.
One, the spread of the illness is quite extensive around theglobe.
There are countries that are testing extensively and have an understanding of their spread.
There are countries that don'thave the capacity as I said in the early days to survey their population or to test for theillness.
and the second reason that it'shigh risk for travel outside ofcanada right now is because wedon't know what is happening in terms of other people'smeasures.
We can see that countries are taking rapid measures very quickly without informing international partners which puts Canadians at risk of being trapped in a country for potentially two weeks or longer.
Depending on the measures that countries take.
and so out of an abundance of caution as we said before, it is best if Canadians stay home and it is best if they travel domestically where we are going to be keeping them up to date in terms of our own health status as a country and in terms of the transparency around the case sand the growth of cases and around any regulations that may affect their particularsituation.
I'd like to thank all canadiansfor the efforts they're making to keep themselves well and to keep their loved ones well.
Thank you.



That is a press conference with a number of cabinet ministers that came out a little bit earlier before the Prime Minister spoke today to give us an update on some of the new and the extraordinary measures that this country is taking to contain and fight COVID-19. The health Minister there pattyhajdu said throughout that press conference that this is a key moment of containment for this country to try to get a handle on the number of cases, to slow the cases, stop the cases.
That's why so many different measures have been put in placetoday.
Vassy kapelos, the host of"power & politics" is with me as well.
Vassy, I mean, it is a fairlyextraordinary day in terms ofthe ramp-up of the measures thathave happened either from apublic health perspective or as we're going to learn in not toolong around 2:00, an economicperspective.
and the government is trying tomanage all of those things atonce.
Which I think that ischallenging for anyone, frankly.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, it'sunprecedented, right? and we got a first signalyesterday, it feels at least tome from various provinces.
We saw the ramp-up in themeasures to counter the spreadof the virus, particularly inontario which announced theshutting of all schools, for allpublic schools, for three weeks.
We saw it in British Columbia and albertawhen they started advisingresidents of their provincesfirst don't travel outside ofcanada.
and we saw it with otherprovinces as well who startedsaying that if you leave youhave to isolate yourself for twoweeks.
and now it's almost come to ahead at a point where now we'regetting national directives onthis stuff.
I think that has certainlyevolved.
If I think back to just tomonday it feels like acompletely different world, right? there were so many thinkingshould I go on March break ornot and made the decision ontheir own.
and now we have a directive fromthe federal government sayingthat it's not a good idea, cancel your travel if you'reheading out there.
and then also I think that wherei'm looking if we're headingforward is that economic pieceas you mentioned.
What we'll hear from billmorneau in half an hour fromnow.
and what are they going to dowith the borders, thoseinternational flights? you heard that last question to the health Minister, right -- doyou consider the united stateshigh risk? I thought that it was aninteresting question and sort ofa telling answer in which shedidn't directly say, ministerhajdu didn't say that weconsider it high risk but sayingthat we recommend no traveloutside of Canada.
So what are the implications ofwhat is happening south of theborder is that the virus is notcontained, at least from everymedical expert that I have heardto the degree that it should be, let's say.
There's an issue there.
What are the implications for ushere in Canada and how do theyimpact the decision that thefederal government makes goingforward.



**Rosemary**:

Given how intertwined the two countriesare.
and let's give people numbers to put that in context what you'retalking about aroundcontainment.
So we heard from Dr. Tam thatthere's been 15, 000 tests for the virus in Canada.
Well, at last count there had been 13, 000 tests in the United States, which you might thinkthat's not so bad.
But remember that the United States has nine times the population of this country.
So it is difficult to contain something if you don't know what the problem is. and that's why we're going to hear from the United States presidentdonald trump later thisafternoon.
The United States media is reporting thathe's expected to declare national state of emergency which will unlock a significant amount of money which one would hope would mean freeing up some of those tests.
Vassy kapelos, the host of"power & politics," thank youfor that.
and david Cochrane is in thewest block on what we just heardthere and what to keep in mind.
David?



**Reporter**:

I want to bring up the point of whether or not they consider the united states to be high risk.
Obviously it was, yes, they do. In a situation like this canadacan only control what canadadoes and what Canada cancontrol.
and if you look at all of the news that we're getting from south of the border, the United States public health response to this has been poor, the information flows have been bad and slow to react to this with a level of urgency that has been required.
That has become obvious in all of the reporting with the problems of the tests out there and the testing done, and theydon't -- I think, Rosie, they want to say this so explicit and public because of you know why and you know who.
There's a political risk here and an unquantifiable risk of other countries taking actions that affect Canadians within those borders that Canada cannot stop or solve and doesn't know that are coming.
They had no idea that the flight ban or the travel ban from theeuropean union to the United States was coming the other night when Donald trump announced that.
In the past under the obamawhite house this is the sort of thing that would have been conveyed to their international partners in advance or at leas ta heads up. None of that is happening right now or hasn't up to this point in a clear way.
Though there's signs that the g7will start coordinating on viralresearch and economic responsein a significant way.
But this is I think the coremessage on that is that canadacan only control what happens incanada right now and what itcan't control is the virus andwhat it can't control is whatother countries do. So stay put unless it'sabsolutely necessary.
Two things to point out, rosie, as sort of reassurance from whatwe're hearing because I thinkthat people are looking forreassurance in what's happeningright now and that is thatcanada has lived experience indealing with large-scale healthoutbreaks from sars to h1n1 andputting plans and systems inplace from a learned experiencefrom that.
Some of the people still dealingwith public health and healthemergencies, you know, at theprovincial levels are dealingwith this now.
So there's experience at thatlevel.
and there's also on the economicfront the lived experience ofthe global meltdown of about 12years ago starting in 2008.
So there is -- there isexperience in dealing with thisand plans that have proven to beeffective or adapted from thefailures of these pastexperiences that are beingdeployed right now.
and one other point too on thererouting of internationaltravel.
a sense that I get from talkingto people from a very obviousway that could be implement sidethat your international travelflights, say, montrÉal andtoronto and vancouver, the threebiggest cities and the biggestairports and the busiestairports and you backstops yourborder services and healthpersonnel there as much as youcan.



**Rosemary**:

Right, okay.
and those details to come.
But that makes sense to send them to big centres.
We're standing by to bring you press conference of the finance minister bill morneau.
He is slated to speak at 2:00. Just got word that the governor of the bank of Canada will join the finance Minister to talk more about the state of the economy right now which, obviously, is in some jeopardy, which is being squeezed because of what is happening around theworld.
and it's something that every country is dealing with.
So we'll hear more about some of the immediate measures that will be put in place that the finance minister will talk about laterbut, of course, the big news came from the prime minister earlier today who announced that there would be a significant fiscal stimulus package to be announced in the coming days to help both the country and its citizens to cope with the pressures of this on the economy and on your personal financestoo.
The Prime Minister as you know or as you may not know isself-isolating right now at homebecause his wife tested positivefor COVID-19. He's there with his family.
But he did take a few moments tocome out and to speak tocanadians earlier today.
Here's what he had to tell us...



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Yesterday I shared with you that My wife Sophie was being tested for COVID-19 and that test did come backpositive.
Sophie's symptoms remain mild.
But we are following medical advice and taking everyprecaution.
She will remain in isolation for the time being.
We are thinking about all of the families across the country who have received the samediagnosis.
We're in good hands.
We have full confidence incanada's health officials andprofessionals.
This means that upon My doctor'srecommendation that I will remain in self-isolation for 14days.
I want to be clear, I have nosymptoms, I have been feelinggood.
and technology allows me to workfrom home.
Of course it's an inconvenienceand somewhat frustrating, but weare all social beings, afterall.
But we have to do this becausewe have to protect ourneighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerableseniors and people withpre-existing conditions.
We are following medical adviceas should all Canadians.
On that note I want to thank all of Canada's health professionalsand the public health agency whoare doing an incredible jobsupporting and looking after all of us. (voice of translator): I wantto take this opportunity tothank all health careprofessionals and the publichealth agency of Canada which isdoing exemplary work.
I now want to tell you whatcanada will be doing to ensureyour safety and security andprotect your health.
Yesterday I had a discussionwith a number of internationalleaders, including presidenttrump in the United States, Prime Minister johnson, andprime Minister conte in italy.
I also took part in the meetingof the special cabinet committeemeeting on COVID-19, and I hadtelephone conversations withfinance ministers with respectto the current economicsituation.
I had an opportunity to talk to the c. E.o. Of the chamber ofcommerce and the president ofthe c. L.c. This morning I had a cabinetmeeting and I spoke to presidentmacron of france.
Those discussions will becontinuing in the coming days.
Earlier today Minister blair, hajdu, did announce that we arerecommending that canadiansavoid all non-essential traveloutside of the country.
We also announced that thecruise ship season will besuspended until July and that we will be tightening controlmeasures at airports.
We will be looking to controlinternational passengersarriving in Canada.
[end of translation]Canada has advised Canadians tocurtail non-essentialinternational travel.
and the cruise season issuspended until July.
and that we're bringing inadditional screening measures atairports.
We are also streamliningoverseas arrivals to be betterpositioned for screening.
Yesterday we saw many provincestake strong steps to keep peoplesafe.
They are doing what they need todo to protect the public and iwant Tod thank them for theirwork.
Later today I'll have a callwith the premiers and theindigenous leaders to discussthe latest developments andcoordinate our efforts, including the over billiondollar COVID-19 response fundwhich provides money to theprovinces and territories tosupport preparation andmitigation.
These are significant steps andwe will do more.
The provinces and theterritories are facing variouslevels of risk but we will makesure that we align our responseacross the country.
and addressing COVID-19 must bea team Canada effort.
To keep Canadians safe, tomitigate the economic impacts ofthe virus at all levels ofgovernment, we are workingtogether.
We are talking regularly.
We are coordinating our efforts.
We're following the situationvery closely.
and we're pulling out all of thestops.
I know that you're worried.
You're worried about yourhealth, about your family'shealth.
About your job.
Your savings.
and about paying rent.
and about the kids not being inschool.
I know that you're concernedabout uncertainty and the globaleconomy.
The steps being taken to keepyou safe have an economicimpact.
But what is also true is that weare in the enviable position ofhaving significant fiscalfirepower available to supportyou.
This is in addition to themeasures that we've alreadytaken.
The finance Minister is also inconstant communication with hisinternational counterparts tofind ways to work together tomitigate the impacts of thevirus on the global economy.
He will have furtherannouncements shortly thisafternoon.
The agreement that we reachedwith other parties to suspendthe house today also still givesus the flexibility to do thethings that we need to do inorder to support Canadians.
No one should have to worryabout paying rent.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking outside of his home where he'sself-isolating with his familyfor the next 14 days.
But as you heard there, stillable to work remotely from hishome, talking to world leaders.
He has a call scheduled withpremiers and indigenous leadersof this country later today.
That is, of course, after thefirst ministers' meeting gotcancelled.
We have special coveragecontinuing here on cbc newsnetwork.
You can watch the financeminister bill morneau, he willbe joined by the governor of thebank of Canada stephen poloz andthey'll be on this network at2:00 p. M. eastern to discusssort of the immediate measuresthat the government might be able to take to help theeconomy.
and we'll take you at 3:00p.
M. eastern to donald trump'snews conference on the pandemic.
and we'll have a special earlieredition of "power & politics" with My colleague and friendvassy kapelos, starting at 4:00p.
M. eastern.
All coming up live thisafternoon right here on cbc newsnetwork.
As we try to keep you really ontop of some important andchanging information on thecoronavirus and the development, the major developments that havehappened here today after thegovernment made a significantnumber of announcements.
One of them and probably the onethat is most important foreveryone to hear today andadvice to not travel -- allnon-essential travel outside ofcanada, the government and thepublic health agency of canadasays should be cancelled.
and that, of course, in thisprovince and in the province ofontario will have an immediateimpact because it's thebeginning of spring break at theend of today, this Friday.
We have cbc's ellen mauro liveat pearson internationalairport.
So, ellen, I can't imagine thatif you have your suitcasespacked and you're checking in, what are people saying and howare they reacting?



**Reporter**:

Well, this is obviously a really difficult situation for travellers with this advisory to avoid anynon-essential internationaltravel this morning, because asyou said people are here at theairport.
Albeit, not many people.
Pearson international iscanada's busiest airport and ihave never seen it as relativelyempty as it is today.
So people, you know, here have ahard choice.
Should they continue on with theplans they may have spent monthssaving for? and a number of the people whowe spoke to here this morningsay they're doing exactly that.
Of course, they're concerned, but they are going ahead withtravel plans.
Have a listen to what some hadto say --



My son is going away for golf tournament and the trainingcamp.
So we have been planning for about two months now.
So, yeah, we're going.



We're already on our way and we have our three kids fromcalgary who are meeting us at the resort.
They're already in the air.
So we are on our way.



I used the expression before that we're past the commitment so we'll take precautions that are necessary and if we have to stay down there longer, thenthat's our choice.



**Reporter**:

What is yourname?



I'm Andrea.



**Reporter**:

I just met andreahere at the airport and you'retraveling with your familytoday?



I am.



**Reporter**:

Where are yougoing?



I feel that I'm as safe here as I can be right now.
I have more access to toiletpaper.



**Reporter**:

a lot of panic buying and hoarding going on. Are you aware of thegovernment's travel advisory issue this morning?



We just heard it en route and we had already checked in, but for our family we are allhealthy, we have been following the precautions and, I feel very safe travelling today.



**Reporter**:

When I saw you, is aw you putting on handsanitizer.
Some of the precautions that you are making for this trip?



As we always do in the flu season in the winter, My kids stay home when they're sick and we wash our hands.
My kids play competitive sport sand if they're not well, wedon't go. and I think that is realistically what everyone should be doing and I understand the panic, but a lot of that is associated with the hype in themedia, I have to say.
and social media.



**Reporter**:

I hope that you have a good flight, a good trip and thank you very much for talking with us. I appreciate it. But we do have those advisories from the federal government and from the province of Ontario and advising people against anynon-essential internationaltravel.
That is the major development ofthe morning, but, again, manytravellers, that we're speakingto like andrea and her familyare continuing on with travelplans.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, it's tough thing to sort out, especially if it's something that as you say, Ellen, that you have been planning and saving for and hoping for.
But what the health minister said though, just in case you talked to more people, is thatit's very high risk and I would also assume that that would mean that if they get into situation in the country where they are not allowed to leave, or it becomes difficult, that the government of Canada will be limited or perhaps not able to help them at all.
So it's interesting that there was one woman in the streeterthere is in that pack of people there that is prepared to stay longer but, you know, I do wonder what people are thinking about if they do get into that kind of a situation and the helpthey'll be able to get is reallylimited.



**Reporter**:

That's really for the issue that we have been waiting for the government to issue that officialnon-essential internationaltravel advisory.
That does change the playingfield quite a bit, you know, because people know that they'retaking on that risk for going.
As we have been discussing theyhave been saving and planning, you know, that reality when youcome back, can you do thatself-quarantine and isolation, can you stay? it's a very fluid situation thattravellers have to considerhere.
But, again, not too manytravellers.
I want to show you more of thescene here at the airport.
You can see a couple dozenpeople but not that manycomparatively.
There are more hand sanitizerstations and they are throughoutthe airport.
You can see this one here.
The airport says that there aremore on order.
But I've been coming to theairport over the past few weeksthroughout our coverage ofcovid-19 and this is really, youknow, a stark difference fromwhat we're seeing here today interms of the level of thecrowds.
As you said, rosie, this is thefriday before March break.
and this would normally be one of the busiest travel days ofthe year.
and what we're seeing at pearsonreflects the growing -- theramping up of the response thatwe're seeing to this virusacross the country.



**Rosemary**:

Right, ellenmauro at Pearson internationalairport, thank you for that, Ellen.
I appreciate it. and, again, the government ofcanada, Canada's public health agency is now telling canadiansthey should avoid allnon-essential travel.
and the risk there is not onlyin terms of getting ill andtrying to contain the spread ofthe virus but it's realizingthat if you come home from acountry where this has spreadrapidly that you mustself-isolate for 14 days whenyou get back.
So that's the bit that everybodyshould really probably startconsidering as they make theirplans.
and the cbc's chris ensing is inwindsor, Ontario, across fromdetroit, michigan, of course.
Chris, what are things lookinglike there because we heard frombill blair earlier in the pressconference that the increasedscreening is not just at landports but at maritime crossingsand so they're ramping up thingseverywhere to make sure they'recontaining things as much aspossible.



**Reporter**:

Well, exactly.
and here we have the ambassadorbridge, one of the busiest international crossings in northamerica.
and you have trucks going across and people in cars to go on march break.
and people were asking if the border is still open, yes, but more signage and different questions being asked as well.
Now if you're coming in from the United states into Canada, you are being asked by border agents more questions because of thecoronavirus.
and at a certain point you maybe pulled aside for a secondary reading if you start to set offflags.
That's when they get on the phone with a quarantine officer.
They aren't on the ground and soit's someone they're talking Toby phone.
But they have the legal authority to put that person in quarantine if they continue to show symptoms.
So the union is calling for presence on that.
a big part about the border as well, we have heard about the economy and how much it affect sand whether to close or keep itopen.
There's 6, 000 to 7, 000 people inside of our region here inwindsor- Essex who cross everyday and they're going to hospitals in Detroit in the health care field.
If you had a change like that you can imagine the impact on that side.
and the other thing about the economy is that we have all of these parts that criss-cross theborder if are or manufacturingsector.
I talked to the head of the autoparts manufacturing associationwho said that smalltimebusinesses here in our communityare feeling a pin, in partbecause of anxiety and wonderingwhat will happen next and theother is cost.
They had to source problem otherparts because of quarantines inother countries.
On Thursday we learned that thechrysler pacific at the assemblyplant here, 6, 000 people, itstopped production out ofconcerns about possible exposureto a coronavirus case.
Now there's no COVID-19 cases atthis time in windsor, but ithalted the line which has atrickle ect for the secondaryproducers and the third-tierproducers and you can see howthis impacts the economy andpeople's jobs.
It's intn an interesting look athow the ripple effect of thesetype of decisions.
But the people that we'retalking to are wondering what ishappening at the border and likewe have heard before it's stillopen and there's addedprecautions and questions, but it's interesting to see how thatall plays out here at a bordercity.



**Rosemary**:

Chris ensing, appreciate the perspective fromwindsor.
a lot is about public health and keeping you safe and well, obviously, but the other part of this is about how it affects theeconomy.
We're about to go to billmorneau and they will talk about the state of the economy and what immediate measures could be put in place to help people, particularly people that are worried about staying home from work or have to look after their children because schools have now been closed both in ontarioand in quÉbec.
We'll bring that to you at the top of the hour.
Jennifer hall though is intoronto and looking at thecountry-wide picture which isreally changing very quickly.
O I'm glad that you could giveus an update, jennifer.



**Jennifer**:

It is, Rosie, hour by hour.
When we look at the numbers and see the measures implemented and announced just today that affect this entire country, that it'sabout prevention and containment and compared to other countries that has suffered outbreaks ofcovid-19, Canada's numbers so far are relatively low.
So the latest numbers that we'reseeing here in terms of the entire country, 179 people.
and that is as we know as ofyesterday, including two youngchildren.
So in British Columbia now reporting 53cases of COVID-19. and moving next door to Alberta, there are 23 cases reportedthere.
and there's also four presumptive cases being reported in Saskatchewan and manitobacombined.
Ontario is where we saw a big jump today.
Ontario has the most cases incanada with a total of 79. So that is what our national total is today.
QuÉbec reporting 17 cases ofcovid-19. and New Brunswick just one case of the virus.
Now important also to point out that the vast majority of thesecases, 90% of them, Rosie, are directly linked to travel.
and some of the measures that provinces have taken and we see new measures every day, soontario yesterday and we saw them announcing that all publicly funded schools would be closing for a grand total of three weeks.
As we have been saying in looking at the airport heading into March break adding two weeks after that which essentially does cover off a14-day period if someone haddecided to travel.
QuÉbec today also deciding toclose all schools.
That is from daycare to cegepand up to universities.
That begins on Monday and thatis for a two-week period as weknow that can always change.
Premier legault also calling onthe trudeau government to limitthe number of foreign visitors.
So making, you know, some urgentdemands from that province.
B.c., among other things we knowthat are calling for acancellation of any gatheringsover 250 people.
and Alberta, rosie, is takingthe step of saying forget aboutinternational travel or going to the United States, why don't youjust stay within our ownprovince.



**Rosemary**:

Right.
I am glad that you pointed out the number of cases that are caused by travel.
You said it's about 90%. and I have someone on twitter asking me that question because once we get to community spread, that is a completely differentpicture.
That's what they're dealingwith, for instance, in Italy an din china.
and the attempt right now is to try to contain things and to limit travel as much aspossible, certainly.
But also to be careful about howyou're interacting with peoplesocially.
Give us a sense of that global picture too.



**Jennifer**:

It is good to look at the global picture an din places hardest hit to see what a country like Canada might be facing.
The W.H.O. In their dailybriefing today has said that now5, 000 people around the worldhave lost their lives tocoronavirus.
It's being called a tragicmilestone.
But here is one of theinteresting things out of thatdaily briefing today.
China no longer considered theepi-centre.
Have a listen.



Europe has now become theepi-centre of the pandemic.
With more reported cases anddeaths than the rest of theworld combined apart from china.
More cases are now beingreported every day than werereported in china at the highestof its epidemic.



**Jennifer**:

So quite remarkable there now to hear that Europe is being considered the epi-centre of thecoronavirus outbreak.
So let's break that down alittle bit for you.
In italy the latest is that thedeath toll has taken a dramaticjump in just the last 24hours -- 25%, that's the largestsince the outbreak there.
and more than 1, 200 people havedied and we know that italy hasimplemented extraordinarymeasures.
The entire country locked down.
Outings and going to the doctorare extremely limited.
There are strict guidelines onall of that.
We have been checking in withpeople holed up now, sometimesalone, in many cases in anapartment.
We know that Canadians are thereand canadian students and ayoung au pair from Canada whowas living a dream and now stuckin a small town in italy unableto get out of the country.
So those are some measures takenthere.
France has now seen 61 deaths.
That's another country in europewhere we are seeing andexpecting to see fairly dramaticincrease in the number of cases.
Spain today announcing in orderto prevent becoming the scenethat we saw in italy, the Prime Minister there saying that we'reimplementing a two-week state ofemergency.
That is starting from tomorrow.
Iran we know that has also beenbadly hit by COVID-19. and the cases there as of todayreported to be surging.
Today reporting the highestsingle day death toll at 85people.
They've had 515 deaths so far.
So back to china, rosie, for afinal thought on that.
Today -- I think that we shouldall take -- it's informative tolook at this number and as wefight this and we're at thebeginning stage of this, fivenew cases only announced todayin wuhan, hubei province whereit all began.
In all of china today only eightnew cases.
So those temporary hospitals setup in a matter of days, we knowthat those have been closing.
and business is returning tonormal.
Just one small example -- appleclosed, I think that it hadclose to 40 stores across thecountry of china closed those inearly February and today sayingthat we're back in business.



**Rosemary**:

That is good context there.
Worth reminding people that the first case was detected sort of in mid-december.
So it was a long haul and therewere extreme measures put inplace in china in order tocontain things but clearly it'sworking.
Thank you, jennifer hall.
I want to show you there a livelook at, of course, what themarkets are doing becausethere's been an impactthroughout the week starting onmonday.
Partly because of the price ofoil after a dispute with saudiarabia.
But, obviously, it is thepressure of what is happeningwith the coronavirus around theworld.
Not as high as they were earlierin the day and still in positiveterritory that would reassure alot of people.
and scott peterson is watchingthis for us. So, scott, it's one day sincethat historic plunge withstocks.
What are the marks telling usnow?



They're waiting for an announcement from bill morneauin about five minutes' time.
We saw the t. S.x. Languishingearlier today and had opened upabout a thousand points and nowit's ready for a stimulusannouncement.
They are almost clairvoyant inpredicting what people expect tohear from the finance Minister.
and with the message from theUnited States president, it could be astate of emergency and they'redeclaring that and that releasesup to $40 billion of funds.
We're watching the energy secton and it's up today and thebanks are up strongly and we'rewatching the travel companiesbeing beaten up for obviousreasons and we're watching aircanada down 13% and this is oneday after the t. S.x. Down 12%, so these are historic times.
But the markets now are gettingready for some sort of morestimulus at 2:00 or 3:00.



**Rosemary**:

So, obviously, maybe don't want at your investments online today, notyet.
But what kind of things could the government do to start pumping -- we heard from the prime Minister of a big stimulus package coming in the coming days and potentially billions from the United States president.
What can a government do though when it's coming to individuals, right, to try to get them some help as it's needed immediately?



**Reporter**:

It's easy enough to get it to corporations, but individuals is tough.
It could be through payroll tax.
But here's a prime minister directly on that question and his answer.
Answer.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We are looking at ways to help Canadians directly, yes, particularly vulnerablecanadians who will be particularly squeezed if theydon't get -- aren't able to go to work.
These are the kinds of things that we're focused on. and we know that small businesses may struggle through or will struggle through this period of economic slowdown, of people choosing to stay at home and protect their families.
We will look at how to support them so that once we get through this difficult time that our economy and Canadians will continue to prosper.

**Rosemary**:

Hello, I'mrosemary Barton.
We have live coverage on CBC News network today of a number of key moments in this country in terms of dealing with thecovid-19 outbreak.
We are expecting soon, perhaps as soon as now, though we'rehearing that it might be Little delayed, the finance minister bill morneau to talk about economic measures that the government is preparing to Putin place to help Canadians to cope with COVID-19. and we are standing by as well to bring you an update from the United States president Donald trump who is expected at 3:00 to announce national emergency in the United states to unlock$40 billion in disaster funding.
First from our finance minister and we'll have that live when itstarts.
Last hour Prime Minister justintrudeau addressed the nation oncanada's plan to handle this.
and he spoke from Ottawa where he and his family are inself-isolation.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Yesterday I shared with you that My wife, Sophie, was tested for COVID-19 and that test did come back positive.
Sophie's symptoms remain mild.
But we're following medical advice and taking everyprecaution.
She will remain in isolation for the time being.
We are thinking about all of the families across the country who have received the samediagnosis.
We're in good hands.
We have full confidence incanada's health officials andprofessionals.
This means that upon My doctor'srecommendation that I will remain in self-isolation for 14days.
I want to be clear that I haveno symptoms and I've beenfeeling good.
and technology allows me to workfrom home.
Of course it's an inconvenienceand somewhat frustrating, we areall social beings, after all, but we have to do this becausewe have to protect ourneighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerableseniors and people withpre-existing conditions.
We are following medical adviceas should all Canadians.
On that note I want to thank all of Canada's health professionalsand the public health agency whoare doing an incredible jobsupporting and looking after all of us. (voice of translator): I wantto take this opportunity tothank all health careprofessionals and the publichealth agency of Canada which isdoing exemplary work.
I now want to tell you whatcanada will be doing to ensureyour safety and security andprotect your health.
a, I had a discussion with anumber of international leaders, including president trump of the United states, prime ministerjohnson, and prime ministerconte in italy.
Also took part in the meeting ofthe special cabinet committeemeeting on COVID-19 and I hadtelephone conversations withfinance ministers with respectto the current economicsituation.
I had an opportunity to talk to the c. E.o. Of the chamber ofcommerce and the president ofthe c. L.c. and I spoke to president macronof france.
and those discussions willcontinue in the coming days.
Earlier today Minister blair, hajdu, did announce that we arerecommending that canadiansavoid all non-essential traveloutside of the country.
We also announced that thecruise ship season will besuspended until July and that we will be tightening controlmeasures at airports.
We will also be looking tobetter control internationalpassengers arriving in Canada.
[end of translation]Canadians have been advised tocurtail non-essentialinternational travel and thatthe cruise season is suspendedto July and that we're bringingin additional screening measuresat airports.
We are also streamliningoverseas arrivals to be betterpositioned for screening.
Yesterday we saw many provincestake strong steps to keep peoplesafe.
They are doing what needs to bedone to protect the public and iwant to thank them for theirexemplary work.
Later today I will have a callwith the premiers and indigenousleaders to discuss the latestdevelopments and coordinate ourefforts, including the over abillion dollar COVID-19 responsefund which provides money to theprovinces and the territories tosupport preparation andmitigation.
These are significant steps andwe will do more.
The territories are facingvarious levels of risk but we'llmake sure that we will align ourresponse across the country.
Addressing COVID-19 must be ateam Canada effort.
To keep Canadians safe, tomitigate the economic impacts ofthe virus, all levels ofgovernment are working together.
We are talking regularly.
We are coordinating our efforts.
We're following the situationvery closely and we're pullingout all of the stops.
I know that you're worried.
You're worried about your healthand about your families' health.
About your job.
Your savings.
and about paying rent.
and about the kids not being inschool.
I know that you're concernedabout --



**Rosemary**:

I don't think that the Prime Minister will mind if we cut him off, a tape from earlier today to go to the press conference that we waited for and with bill morneau andstephen poloz.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Thank you for being here today.
I'm here with governor pol oz and the superintendent of financial institutions Jeremy routen.
I am told that this is a rareoccasion, maybe a first for finance Minister, a governor of the bank of Canada and the superintendent of financial institutions to make a policy announcement together.
These are extraordinary times.
and that means that we are ready to take extraordinary measures.
In order to tackle the challenges that we face we must have a coordinated approach.
Over the last few weeks, you have seen us take action swiftly to protect the health and the safety of Canadians.
This remains our utmostpriority.
Our message to Canadians is clear -- follow the advice of public health authorities.
That includes washing your hands frequently and closely monitoring symptoms and stayingup-to-date with the latestinformation on our government'swebsite.
I understand that some of youwatching today are worried aboutyour families.
We encourage all Canadians totake steps as necessary toprotect themselves.
As we have seen this week, thereality of this virus means thateverybody needs to take thenecessary precautions.
We know that this virus iscreated impacts on our economy.
and we're ready to address theseimpacts.
Earlier this week we announcedover $1 billion to make surethat our public health responsecontinues to be world class.
Through the response finished femaking $500 million available tostrengthen our health caresystem.
My colleague, Minister pattyhajdu, is in conversation withher counterparts to ensure thattheir needs continue to be met.
We're also investing $275 million to strengthencanada's capacity in researchand development.
Including research on medicalcounter measures, includinganti-virals, vaccine developmentand support for clinical trials.
The uncertainty that we've seenhas also had an impact onbusinesses and on workers.
To ensure that we continue toprotect workers, we announced awaiving of the one-week periodto claim the employmentinsurance sickness benefit ifthey need to be quarantined.
To support businesses that havebeen affected by COVID-19, weenhanced the work-sharingprogramme so that workers cancontinue to be employed, even iftheir hours of work are reduced.
Well, what we're experiencing isa health crisis.
Given its breadth across theglobe, it has important economicconsequences.
The uncertainty surrounding thespread of COVID-19 has increasedvolatility in our markets.
and I know that this has mademany Canadians anxious.
But I'd like to start by sayingthat Canada has the strongestand the most resilient bankingsystem in the world.
That's what allowed us to fareso well during the financialcrisis.
It's even better capitalized nowand will serve Canadians just as well.
As I have made it very clearbecause of our strong fiscalposition, we're ready and ableto respond to any challengesthat we face.
I've been in constant contactover the last couple weeks withthe banks, with labourrepresentatives and withbusiness leaders, as well as myinternational and domesticcounterparts so that we cancontinue to be coordinated inour activities.
To achieve this goal I'll behosting a weekly conference callwith My provincial andterritorial counterparts.
We'll continue to work togetheron behalf of all Canadians.
In fact, I spoke this morningwith the Minister of finance inontario and the Minister offinance in quÉbec.
The government of Canada ispreparing a significant stimulusprogramme to be released nextweek to stabilize our economy, to support businesses and toprotect Canadians during adifficult time.
As a first step today I'mannouncing that we areestablishing our credit facilityprogramme to support businessesand to stimulate the economy.
This will make $10 billionavailable in additional supportfor canadian businesses throughthe business development bank ofcanada and export developmentcanada.
(voice of translator): I'm inconstant contact with the banks, union leaders, and the businessleaders as well as myinternational counterparts.
and national counterparts.
So that we can continue ourcoordination and collaborationto reach this objective.
and we will realize a weeklycall with My provincialcounterparts and My territorialcounterparts.
We will continue to worktogether on behalf of allcanadians.
The government of Canada isputting in place fiscal stimulusmeasures, major measures, whichwill be announced next week tostabilize our economy, tosupport our businesses, and toprotect Canadians during thisdifficult period.
First, I am announcing todaythat we are putting in place ourcredit facility programme tosupport our businesses and tostimulate the economy.
Under this programme $10 billionwill be made available tocanadian businesses to supportthe business development bankand the export development bankof Canada.
[end of translation]this proves to be an effectivetool during the 2008 financialcrisis and it will ensure thatour businesses continue to beresilient during these veryuncertain times.
In addition to activities thathave been taken by financialsector authorities, I have beenin regular communications withthe c. E.o. S of Canada's largebanks.
Canadian banks also recognizethe significant potentialnegative impact that COVID-19may be having or may have onsome of their customers.
They've made a commitment to me. We had a discussion as recentlyas a couple hours ago, that theywill support businesses andindividuals through thesedifficult times in aresponsible, fair, andcompassionate way.
We'll be holding regular calls, twice weekly calls, in thecoming weeks to ensure that thishappens.
So with that I'd like to turn togovernor poloz to talk to you as well.

Thank you.



I'd like to ask Jeremy rudennow to speak.



**THANK YOU, MINISTER. TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOUTHE MEASURES THAT WE HAVEDECIDED TO TAKE TO SUPPORT THERESILIENCE OF FINANCIALINSTITUTIONS AND THEIR ABILITYTO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY. SO AS THE MINISTER MENTIONED ANDMANY OF YOU WILL RECALL, THECANADIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEMPERFORMED VERY WELL DURING THEGLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. SINCE THAT TIME, THERE'S BEEN ASTRENGTHEN OF REQUIREMENTS ANDSUPERVISORY EFFORTS AND THEMOVEMENT TO IMPROVE THERESILIENCE OF FINANCIALINSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE THROUGH APERIOD OF STRESS LIKE THE ONETHAT WE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING. ONE OF THESE MEASURES WAS TOINSTITUTE WHAT WE CALLED THEDOMESTIC STABILITY BUFFER WHICHIS AN ADDITIONAL CAPITALREQUIREMENT FOR DOMESTIC, SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKSTHAT IS BUILT UP IN GOOD TIMESAND RELEASED WHEN NEEDED. TODAY WE ARE LOWERING THEDOMESTIC STABILITY BUFFERREQUIREMENT FOR BANKS BY 1.25%OF RISK WAGED ASSETS, EFFECTIVEIMMEDIATELY. TO LEMIND YOU THAT THE D.S.B. WAS SET AT 2.25% OF RISKWEIGHTED ASSETS, EFFECTIVE AS OFTHE END OF APRIL. AND WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THED.S.B. REQUIREMENT IS NOW SET AT1%. THIS ACTION WILL REINFORCE THEABILITY TO APPLY CREDIT TO THEECONOMY DURING THE EXPECTEDPERIOD OF DISRUPTION RELATED TOCOVID-19 AND MARKET CONDITIONS. WE CALCULATE THAT THE RELEASE OFTHE D.S.B. WILL SUPPORT INEXCESS OF $300 MILLION OFLENDING CAPACITY BY THE MAJORBANKS. WE ARE ENCOURAGING THESEINSTITUTIONS TO USE THIS CAPITALAS WELL AS THEIR LIQUIDITYBUFFERS AS REQUIRED. [Speaking French](Voice of Translator)**:

and to reduce this reserve by 1.25%effective immediately.
Recently the level was set at2.25%, but with thisannouncement, the requirement will be reduced to 1.25%. based on our calculations, this will increase the capacity of large financial institutions to extend loans to a further amount of $300 billion.
[end of translation]we're also committing that thebuffer will not increase for atleast 18 months from today.
and during these 18 months we will continue to review thelevel of the buffer in case we need to institute a furtherreduction.
We're also announcing that inview of the current developmentsand in particular the strain onoperations of financialinstitutions, we are suspendingconsultations on all new orrevised guidance that we havecurrently have.
and this includes suspending theconsultation which is currentlyongoing on the proposed changeto the benchmark rate foruninsured mortgages or as it'smore commonly called a mortgagestress test.
and the suspension of allconsultation will continue untilnormal operations can be resumedin the financial system.
As a result, institutions willcontinue to use the benchmarkrate as currently published by the bank of Canada.
(voice of translator): we havealso decided to halt allconsultations with regard tochanges in regulations, including the consultation onchanges to the mortgage stresstest.
We will suspend thoseconsultations until normalconditions have returned.
[end of translation]we will continue to work closelywith our domestic partners andinternational regulators toaddress the uncertainties in thedays ahead and to promotecoordination and financialstability.
Thank you.



All right, thank you verymuch.



I'd like to thank thesuperintendent, and also thank the governor for -- for the efforts that we've made to work together in a coordinatedfashion.
Of course, both of them continue to represent independentorginisations of government and that is an important function of the Canadian economy and the strength that we have.
But in a time of stress our ability to work together is critically important.
I want to be very clear with you today -- while we've taken some very important steps, our government continues to be planning for every contingency.
We're going to continue to respond to challenges as theycome.
Our government is ready, able, and we will be nimble in ourresponses.
We'll continue to protectcanadians and we're currently considering a variety of important options to help the min this time of need.
To all Canadians, our government wants you to know that we have your back.
We'll take every necessary step in future to ensure that you can have confidence.
As you can see today we've taken important steps together to keep our economy strong.
and just a word from me -- we are fortunate to live in country where over the course of the last day that I've been able to speak to provincial financeministers, our prime minister has been able to caucus with premiers from across thecountry, and we've been able to work together as financial institutions in government, andwe've been able to get the banks together to talk about how they can best meet up to thischallenge.
We have a country able to work together in a concerted way to protect Canadians and to protect our economy and to keep usstrong.
Thank you very much.
and we're happy to take yourquestions.



Absolutely.
Thank you very much.
Just a reminder that we're also using the mikes so we're going to start with CTV and then go to more afterwards.

**Question**:

Ian wood, CTV news.
You've done a lot forbusinesses, but it doesn't seem that there's know much for workers outside of e. I. eligibility being expanded.
Will you increase sick leave benefits for those that don'tusually receive them?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, let me start by saying that as your Minister of finance that we are going to do whatever it takes to protect canadiansand keep our economy strong.
We are looking now at the ways that we can deliver support tocanadians to make sure they have the money they need as they go through a challenging time.
You have heard us today introduce measures that are going to add $300 billion in lending capacity to businesses.
That's in support of workers.
So we will continue to figure out how we can deliver -- that'swhat we're doing right now.
So the quantum is not inquestion, the support for workers is not in question.
We'll have more to talk about next week.

---

**Question**:

What about someone who is -- who does not receive sick benefits and they're sort out of the loop on this, except for potentially having this.
and My second question was more, do we fear political or economic ramifications from the United States if we were to close our borders with them?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

We're going to continue to take the best advice from health authorities on how we should manage our borders.
We know that keeping canadianssafe and protecting their heal this not only critically important for people, but it's also important for our economy by mitigating the risks that wesee.
and we'll continue to take thatapproach.
