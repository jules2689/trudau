**Announcer**:

This is a CBC news special presentation.



**Rosemary**:

Hello, I'm rosemary Barton.
This is special live coverage on CBC and CBC news network.
We are standing by at this hour to hear from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau any moment now.
He is in self-isolation here in ottawa.
His wife, sophie gregoire-trudeau, has tested positive for COVID-19. He will be coming out of his home to speak with reporters.
Right there.
As you can see on your screen at around 12:10. But that press conference may be delayed by the press conference we're going to go back to right now.
Many cabinet ministers and Canada's chief public health doctor, Dr. Teresa tam, who has just told Canadians that they should postpone and cancel any travel outside of this country because of the growing number of COVID-19 cases around the world and, indeed, in this country.
He's take you back to that press conference now.
Standing by to hear from the Prime Minister.



**Interpreter**:

As well as your attendance of large international events and conference and sports events.
This is particularly important for those who are older and those who have underlying medical conditions because they're more susceptible to developing more serious illness.
Also very important for health workers and others who come into close contact with infected people to avoid travel.
But you've chosen to remain in the country and not to travel, you can protect your family and do your part to help us flatten the curve and slow the spread of the coronavirus and to protect the most vulnerable among us. Don't forget if you are traveling abroad, you may have to submit to the measures in place in those countries so your one-week trip could end up lasting much longer and access to high-quality health care in those countries could also be limited.
and provinces and territories have set up additional health requirements.
For example, for health care workers most notably.
We also need to do things in Canada to flatten the epidemic curve.
All travelers arriving in Canada will have to be careful to self-monitor for symptoms when they return.
If you are returning from iran, italy or hubei province in china, we're asking you to self-quarantine for 14 days and to communicate with local health authorities.
We are also asking travelers arriving in Canada from abroad to consider self-isolating as a precautionary measure.
We need to ensure that as many Canadians as possible remain in good health.
and one way of achieving this is social distancing.
Social distancing is something important that everyone can do. It can help us control the spread.
It means avoiding high-traffic areas and nonessential gatherings.
Consider shopping or taking public transit outside of peak hours and greeting people by tapping elbows instead of having a handshake.
As far as possible, stand a couple of arm's lengths away from other people.
The time has come for organizers to defer, cancel or change their plans if there are plans to have large gatherings like concerts, conferences and large social or religious gatherings.
We all need to help prevent the spread of the virus.
If you are sick, do not attend mass gatherings and do not attend places where there are a lot of people.
Everyone knees to flatten the curve.
We need to change our behavior and adopt good personal hygiene practices like wash one's hands frequently and practicing [inaudible]. thank you.



Dr. Tam issued a formal health advisory on the Th of March, advising Canadians to avoid traveling on cruise ships.
I'm here to announce another part of that programme and that is, as you know, the cruise ship season begins at the beginning of April here in Canada.




**Interpreter**:

Deciding to take small measures and notably we've decided that cruise ships deporting over 500 people will not be able to stop in Canada until July 1. At that point, we will review the situation and see if things have improved.
This will apply through hfp-in the arctic, rather, for the entire 2020 season because they are not [inaudible] resources in this part of the country.
These decisions were not easy to make.
We are aware of the impact that they will have in communities.



The situation after the 30th of June.
If things have improved, then at that moment we'll make a decision as to whether we can allow the cruise ship season to resume.
In the case of cruise ships that are smaller, we will be putting -- and that includes ferries, by the way.
We will be putting in place a series of additional health measures to ensure that those that will be on the smaller ships and on these ferries, that they need to be taken for their health are taken.
We will be speaking about one additional measure that we made about today and the concerns overseas international flights.
and that decision is about overseas international flights coming into Canada will be restricted to a smaller is number of airports.
We're working out the specific airports at this time.
But we believe that this is a precaution that we should take so that we concentrate any overseas international passengers coming into Canada to a smaller number of airports and we'll have details on that very shortly.
Thank you.



Good afternoon, everyone.
I'd like to first of all begin by thanking Canadian for cooperation and their due diligence over the past several weeks.
We know this has been a very challenging time.
But we believe Canada is in a strong position because we are a nation where collaboration and cooperation from the public is so apparent.
As I indicated previously, we have enhanced our screening measures and those things have been in place at all of our international ports of entry since the beginning of February.
In March, we significantly enhanced and upped the game of ensuring additional measures were included to include all land rail, marine ports of entry.
Since that time, and there are a number of other measures we've taken, but we have been in constant communication with all of our international provinces and provincial and territorial counterparts as well as we work together to keep Canadians safe.
and as Minister garneau has indicated, today we are working through the authorities and requirement and consultation with stakeholders to ensure that international libels in specific areas will allow us to concentrate our precious resources for our border services officer and public health officers to ensure that they can do the important job that Canadians require of screening a variety of passengers to make sure that, first of all, they are safe and healthy and they are properly referred and dealt with, should they be symptomatic or need our assistance and to assure Canadians we're taking all the steps necessary to protect their health and, you know, with the advisories that have been issued today, with the works that we continue to do together, we will continue to work collaboratively across the country, informed by the excellent work of our public health officials in order to ensure that we take the steps necessary to keep Canadians safe.
Thank you.



Ok. and I believe that we're now going to hear from the Prime Minister.
and we will then leave the room and all come back.
You can grill him and grill us to your heart's content after that.
Ok. 



We're very happy to answer your questions at that time.
and I know it will be a pleasure for the Prime Minister to answer questions as well.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. An extraordinary press conference by some ministers and Canada's chief public health officer as we're looking that the shot of Rideau cottage where the Prime Minister lives with his family and it is also where he and his family are self-isolating today.
After a positive result for his wife, sophie gregoire trudeau's test on COVID-19. The Prime Minister has not been tested, nor has his -- nor have his children.
They are not showing any symptoms right now.
But they are all now self-isolating at Rideau cottage for the next 14 days because that is the advice of public health officials.
Let me tell you a couple of important bits of news that came out of that press conference before I bring in some of My colleagues helping us with their coverage.
Dr. Teresa tam, the chief public health officer, says that Canadians right now should cancel or postpone all nonessential travel.
Cruise ships with 500 people or more will not be allowed to stop in Canada until July 1. Smaller cruise ships or ferries will be given additional health measures to help them cope with things.
Overseas flights will now be concentrated in a couple of airports.
The locations have yet to be determined.
But that will help as well to screen people coming in from other countries.
Right now the essential message everyone should be taking from what we heard just now is Dr. Teresa tam's advice that Canadians cancel or postpone all nonessential travel.
That happening as we wait for the Prime Minister to come out of his home and speak to reporters who, I would imagine, are a fair ways back from where the Prime Minister will be speaking, given that he is self-isolating and after that, we'll go back to the ministers who say they will answer further questions about what is a serious ramp-up of measures to try and contain the number of COVID-19 cases in this country and to keep made then I can'ts safe.
157 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Canada.
One of them confirmed inside that house there, sophie gregoire-trudeau.
I believe My colleague Vassy kapelos, of course the host of "power & politics", is joining me from her studio.
But we'll keep this shot up in case the Prime Minister appears and he is supposed to do that at any moment.
It's probably important for Canadians to see and hear from the Prime Minister today.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, extremely important for a number of reasons.
First of all, we need to hear from him.
You're absolutely right.
That recommendation to essentially cancel your travel, em when so many people in this province and other provinces are about to leave or in the midst of leaving or thinking about whether they should leave for March break.
and we heard from the current with matt Galloway talk about the potential at the border.
Minister garneau talked about how overseas flights will be limited to a smaller number of airports.
We don't have any details on than a we don't know if that is the full extent of what the government plans to do at the border that.
Was something that the Prime Minister left open in that interview with matt.
So, I'm very curious to see and definitely anticipating some comments from the Prime Minister on that.
Beyond all that logistical stuff, this is an unprecedented time in this country.
a very significant point where the spread of this virus is concerned and Canadians are most definitely waiting to hear from the Prime Minister.
Especially since he's dealing with his own situation there.



**Suhana**:

Which really brings it home for his family.
I think for everyone.
Because leadership is also demonstrating the things that you need to do and certainly he has done that.
After self-isolating and making that decision yesterday.
Day Cochrane is there.
Earlier in the week, the government announced $1 billion for essentially health measures, support around research and other things and for provinces.
Wi might hear other measures.
This is the day where the government throws everything it has at this.



The finance Minister will have a press conference at 2:00 today to announce, as we understand it, significant measures to bring stability to the economy during this COVID-19 outbreak.
If you look at the totality of what has already been done and schools being closed, trips being canceled, flights being rerouted with deployment and all of the other measures announced from a public health perspective, the rim effect of all of that through the economy is enormous as anyone who has been looking at stock markets, for example, over the last couple of days.
So we may see things from the finance Minister today on infusions of cash at the banks, liquidity and the stock markets and financial markets can work properly.
They have floated the idea of giving credit to businesses and financial support to businesses bridging them through these difficult times.
Because clearly there will be less spending and less socializing and less tourism and less retail transactions in a lot of key areas and, of course, all of the workers will be affected or have to take time off because day cares may close.
People need income support and financial support, particularly people in the gig economy or people working hourly wages.
So, there has been a foreshadowing of significant economic measures to come.
Bill morneau doing his thing as a stand.
Alone from all of these other ministers shows an acute focus on dealing with these issues.
I was supposed to be a Rideau college and I'm outside parliament.



**Rosemary**:

My apologies, yeah.



**Reporter**:

We were supposed to get the budget on the 30th of March.
We don't know what's happening now.
Pablo Rodriguez, the house leader, said with the suspension of parliament, they all agreed that is budget date would be changed.
The finance department and p. M.o. is saying that is still to be determined and to be decided.
They can deliver a budget without parliament sitting and they haven't given the financial authority to respond to the pandemic while parliament has been suspended.
We have a down payment of billion dollars on Wednesday and the second big payment coming and then when it does happen on the 30th, Te could see even more.
But the caution is you won't see all of it at once because this is a fluid changing situation.
So, the response should always be fluid and nimble and changing.



**Rosemary**:

David did mention that parliament made the decision unanimously to suspend the city, both in the house of commons and senate.
We are now looking at a shot of Rideau cottage.
In case you didn't know, that is where the Prime Minister of Canada lives, for now.
Because 24 Sussex is not really habitable.
That is where he and his family are currently self-isolating for the next two weeks.
and they are doing that because the Prime Minister's wife, sophie gregoire trudeau, after a trip to london, england was not feeling well and experience add mild fever.
Got tested for koifds and -- COVID-19 and last night it was confirmed that she did, indeed, contract the virus.
The Prime Minister is said to be in good health.
Not showing any symptoms.
He has not been tested.
But he and his wife and three children are staying in the house, self-isolating as the public health agency of Canada is telling anyone to do if, indeed, you tested positive or have any symptoms or you've been traveling.
He tweeted an instagram of photos working in his home office, making a variety of calls and holding a cabinet meeting earlier today.
G-7 leaders have agreed at this stage to have a meeting and extraordinary video conference meeting on Monday to discuss COVID-19 and the economic impact because that is the other part of this story as well as the health and public health of Canadians.
It is the economic impact that david was talk about there and we're set also to hear from the president of the United States later today.
Who says that he has new information, too, tweeting that it's possible that this -- the test, which has been a major problem in the United States, will ramp up. We did hear from teresa tam today that Canada has test more than 15, 000 Canadians to date, saying that 157, at least at the moment where she spoke, have been confirmed.
Vassy, I'll bring you back in as we wait for the Prime Minister to emerge from his home to speak to Canadians.
I guess this question of the budget and the money that might be needed to support Canadians, that is going to need to be really, really important in the coming weeks.
As, for instance, in Ontario and Quebec now, schools have been shut down.
So people will have to come up with arrangements or maybe not go to work.



**Vassy**:

Exactly.
and from the information that I'm gathering right now, that is what you can expect this afternoon.
At least in part from the announcement of the finance Minister and maybe we'll hear something about it from the Prime Minister as well.
Particularly it has to do with a large sect of the population that was not really addressed in that $1 billion announcement.
I think it was Wednesday.
But the $1 billion, part of that ed a dress sort of e. I. for people who were either quarantined or have been diagnosed and, therefore, were self-isolating.
Apartments or people who have to stay home in order to take care of their kids now that schools are shut or have to stay home because they aren't feeling well.
The message we received over and over again, is if you feel at all sick, you should not be going to work.
The problem is, of course, so many people are employed and don't have sick day coverage or an extend amount of sick day coverage.
So, My expectation is there will be something in here today for that.
All against the backdrop of the fact that as you've been talk about is the budget, we don't know when, will be introduced at some point.
Does this now go into oriented around the huge hit the economy is already taking and about to take as a result of all these significant and important health measures.



**Rosemary**:

If you are just tuning in here on CBC or CBC news network, we are bringing you a live special at this hour, swaying to hear from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressing the nation.
About how the country is doing with COVID-19, what his government is doing to help manage the fallout of that.
That is Rideau and his family where they are self-isolating.
An effect that will affect many more Canadians if this starts to spread the way that the government believes that it will, given the rather drastic measures that were announced today.
and I think the key ones for everyone to hear again and again is that the chief public health officer is telling Canadians they should cancel all nonessential travel and certainly in the province of Ontario and spring break starts at the end of the day today.
That will have a dramatic effect on many people, many families.
Other spring breaks have happened but still to come in Manitoba, for instance.
David, I don't know if you're still there, but you did the story yesterday for "the national" about how sophie trudeau was doing and how the family was coping.
I don'ten if we got a sense of how they were managing the situation or how she's feeling and how he's feeling, the Prime Minister.



**Reporter**:

We did get the statement from Sophie gregoire Trudeau saying thank you for reaching out to her.
She said I'm resting comfortably in quarantine at home and her situation is far better, she says, than other Canadians who are dealing with this or dealing with more urgent and chronic health concerns.
a positive attitude in a difficult time is the way to describe it and it was clear that they have said that the Prime Minister is fine.
He is not being tested and that is on the advice of medical experts and public health officials.
and what's important to note there is if you look at the entirety of their response as a federal government, rosey, it has been guided and led by science and medical e -- expertise with as little politics as much as possible, even when it involves the Prime Minister's personal health.
So, this is a significant situation because he's in isolation.
Natural resources Minister sea mus o'regan is also in isolation while he awaits a test and Mary nag is also in isolation because she has asthma issues.
Jag meet Singh in isolation.
There are continuity of government plans, depending on the severity of all this and how widespread it goes.
They all have encrypted computers and phones that will allow them to continue to run a g-7 country and g-7 economy while in self-isolation and the public sector is taking steps to deal with this.
Speaking with an a official the other day, the employment insurance programme, for example, is one of avenues to help people who might lose their job or have their income interrupted as a way of making sure they can get paid.
What happens if the virus hits the workforce as the employment insurance processing centres.
They have to come up with contingency plans for all of this.
So, there is a pandemic plan that has been in place to deal with an influenza outbreak.
It was developed post-sars, one of the many lessons learned from the systemic and medical failures in the sars outbreak Sears ago.
and that has been the baseline that they are following to deal with this.
Whether it's the Prime Minister's own personal health and that of his family and wife sophie gregoire trudeau.
Teresa tam, our chief medical officer, is one of the advisers for the W.H.O. and she is in that room and she has the best information on how to respond to this pandemic.



**Rosemary**:

As well as telling Canadians they should avoid all nonessential travel outside the country, the Canadian military is also banning all foreign travel and nonessential personnel to stay home.
and people who are deployed overseas will not be able to return to Canada right now if that had been part of the intent.
I think we will go to Chris ensing.
He is in Windsor.
Of course, that is just across from Detroit.
and, you know, I don't know if the process has already changed there, Chris.
Give us a sense of what you are seeing and hearing today.



I think a big part of what's going on is we don't have a confirmed case of COVID-19 at the moment.
Testing is ongoing for some people, but it hasn't hit in Windsor.
and what we noticed across the border in Michigan is the increase in cases.
There's 12 right now.
We heard from their top doctor there talking about how they may not have enough federal tests.
They're worried about that in Michigan.
and that has created worries at the border.
There's 6, 000 or 7, 000 people that cross from Windsor into Michigan every single day and the majority of those people work in the health care industry.
People are concerned about what cheque checks -- what checks are in place at the rd Boer.
At certain points an officer may be able to pull you aside to go through a more thorough screening if you raise flags.
But the union of the border patrol officers for cbsa, for people coming from Michigan inside here, they are calling for more people on the ground who are quarantined officers.
Right now if somebody does present something to an officer with the CBS that raises concern about the coronavirus or COVID-19, that office her go through a line of questioning with that person.
But the quarantine officer, the only person who can legally place that traveler into quarantine is communicating with the officer through phone.
So they're not on the ground.
It is like going to a doctor's office and having the doctor on the cell phone while trying to check you out.
The union is trying to add more people put on the ground there.
It will be interesting to see if that's part of what happens with those measures.
It has been something that is on the mind of people here.
In Windsor right now, in this moment, we're getting an update in this hour.
People are trying to do what they can to continue that self-isolation and social distancing to keep it that way.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you so much.
We're about a minute and a half away from the Prime Minister coming out of his home there at Rideau cottage.
You might have some news, David?



**Reporter**:

Look, we're focus on the news today of big new measures in terms of extra screening and diversion of flights, canceling your travel plans.
I don't think you can stress this enough and public health officials say this at every single availability they've had since this outbreak.
It is the single individual choices and actions that people make and do that is the front hind of defending against the spread of this.
Soap will save lives.
You can exercise appropriate social distancing and in addition to don't go to Florida for spring break, there are recommendations to shop at off-peak hours and use public transit at off-peak hours.
These are the measures that places like korea and china, which have gone super aggressive on the isolation measures, even removing children from families when there is a case spread inside a family unit, have shown to be effective.
So people, I think, you can't stress this enough.
It gets lost in the big headlines of market tumbles and border closures and travel bans.
But this has been the consistent message from the world health organization on down that the best way to do this is change those individual behaviours.
I've scrubbed My hands raw over the past couple of weeks because -- I'm going to be quiet because there's the Prime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

Yes.
Justin Trudeau emerging from his home there at Rideau cottage to speak to Canadians.
Let's listen to him now.
