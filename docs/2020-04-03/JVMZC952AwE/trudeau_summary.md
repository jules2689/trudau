### Summary:


Yesterday I shared with you that My wife Sophie was being tested for COVID-19 and that test did come back positive.
Sophie's symptoms remain mild, but we're following medical advice and taking every precaution.
We have full confidence in Canada's health officials and professionals.
I want to be clear -- I have no symptoms and I'm feeling good and technology allows me to work from home.
We are following medical advice as should all Canadians.
On that note, I want to thank all of Canada's health professionals and the public health agency who are doing an incredible job supporting and looking after all of us. 



Announced that Canadians have been told to curtail nonessential international travel and the cruise season is suspended until July.
We are also streamlining overseas arrivals to be better positioned for screeningful yesterday we saw many provinces take strong steps to keep people safe.
They are doing what needs to be done to protect the public and I want to thank them for their exemplary work.
Later today I'll have a call with premiers to discuss the latest developments and co-ordinate our efforts including the over $1 billion COVID-19 response fund which provides money to the province and territories to support preparation and mitigation.
To keep Canadians safe and mitigate the economic impacts of the virus, all levels of government are working together.
We are talking regularly, coordinating efforts and following the situation very closely and we're pulling out all the stops.
You're worried about your health and about your family's health.
The steps being taken to keep you safe have an economic impact.
The finance Minister is also in constant communication with his international counterparticipates to find ways to work together, to mitigate the impacts of the virus on the global economy. The agreement we reached with other parties to suspend the house today also gives us the flexibility to do the things we need to do in order to support Canadians.
We have outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job.



We will give the proper resource on all arrivals to ensure that we're doing everything we can to keep Canadians and Canada safe.
We will make those decisions on the best science, the best recommendations of our health officials.



Two days ago, we announced a billion-dollar plan to invest in health and support Canadians across the country. Ism and hope Canadians. We do not want any canadian to have to worry about whether or not they will be able to pay their rent or whether or not they will be able to buy groceries or care for their kids.
We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.
We'll be following up on those in the coming days as well.
I've been very busy both yesterday and today, we'll continue to work from home remotely to do the important things that need to be done to keep Canadians safe.
We'll don't do the work that needs to be done to keep Canadians safe while following all directions by our public health officials.
For now, I'm continuing to work extremely hard from home.
In terms of advice I've gotten from medical professionals, it was explained to me that as long as I do not show any symptoms at all, there is no value in having me tested.







According to health officials, the fact that I have expressed absolutely no symptoms means that anyone I engaged with this week has not been put at risk.



We, as are many, many Canadians right now, following very carefully the advice that public health professionals are telling us in terms of what we can do and shouldn't do.



We have been working very closely with our counterparts in the United States to co-ordinate our efforts at the border and to align our efforts.
There is certainly ongoing conversations that will continue to be had as the situation evolves, but I'm confident we'll continue to wonger closely with the americans to keep people in north america safe, particularly to keep Canadians safe.
I've been on the phones with macron and cabinet and officials and members of My team as we work to keep Canadians safe.



My concern is that Canadians continue to follow the directions of public health authorities.
Finding that middle ground is always going to be challenging by have tremendous confidence that Canadians will be able to.



We are obviously having some very good conversations with our kids about what is going on, about how not to be overly concerned but a little bit concerned, which is obviously why they are home today with us. We're going to continue to have thoughtful conversation as partners across the country will be having with their kids.
We have followed the instructions and the advice and recommendations of our public health officials.
and there is a way that has allowed for control and non spread of the virus that gives us confidence that our public health officials are giving us the right recommendations for Canada.



We are obviously focused primarily on how we're going get money into the pockets of Canadians who will need it because of this situation.
But our focus right now is on ensuring that Canadians have the resources and the money to not have to stress about rent and about groceries and child care and elder care at a time where they are also very worry about their health and their family's health.
We will be supporting the economy and Canadians through this time.
