**Rosemary**:

All right, that is a rather extraordinary pressconference, the finance minister of Canada, the governor of the bank of Canada and Canada'ssuperintendent of financialinstitutions.
and the reason that is unusual is because normally those three entities work separately.
and what you saw here today was coordinated action on a number of fronts to try and to stave off what could be serious damage in the economy because ofcoronavirus.
Rebecca young of scotiabank is the director of economic and fiscal policy of the economics department and she's in Toronto.
Thank you for being here, rebecca.
So that -- I'm not overstatingthat, that is unusual and extraordinary to see those three people together with that sort of concerted effort to try to shore up the economy?



Absolutely.
I would agree that what we saw just now is reallyunprecedented.
I think that it's unprecedented on many fronts.
Part is that coordination that we see across three independent institutions that have really come together in a very seriousway.
But also in a very speedy way.
So I think we have to give them credit for the speed with which they were able to come together with this package.
I would say for each of the three institutions that we heard from today that unprecedented in each of their own ways.
So, first, if we turn to what the finance Minister announce dis that he has really not waited for a budget, a budget can bebig, it can be long, it can be-- it can take time to come to see the light of day.
So I think we saw an unprecedented step to bringsomething.
We saw something amounting to$10 billion.
So we're talking big money rightnow.
So we saw that.
and then we saw the bank ofcanada and it's been less than10 days since they dropped rates by 50 basis points.
So a hundred basis points in 10days in between the scheduledannouncements.
So that's unprecedented.
When we look at this, this is the first time that we have seen this counter cyclical counterbuffer.
So it was a lesson coming out of the global financial crises and it was intended for times like this and what we're seeing now is that it's going to be used for the purposes of which it wasdesigned.
So definitely on that front it'sreally unprecedented what we have seen today.



**Rosemary**:

Maybe let's just go back to that last point that you made that the superintendent of financial institutions talkedabout, because it was difficult to understand.
It wasn't very plain language.
But essentially it does what forbanks? it allows them to carry moreliquidity? to have more liquidity? is that it?



Yes, absolutely.
It's basically, it's banks that are considered systemicallyimportant.
So all of the big banks are required to hold capital aside in good times that can then be drawn down in times like today.
So rainy days like today.
So it will actually encourage banks to lend on in times where there is more pressure in thesystem.
and so it is -- it is essentially the rainy day fund, if you think of saving in the good times so in the down times you can lend.
So that is what we're seeing now with that buffer.



**Rosemary**:

So those are --those are sort of measures to shore up -- you know, the economic -- the financial system across the board.
I guess that some will have impact on individuals directly.
and the governor of the bank ofcanada talking about it there, particularly around mortgage sand that kind of thing.
But we're also expecting more next week in terms of a larger stimulus package forindividuals.
I only have about 30 seconds but what are you looking for there?



We're missing one piece of the puzzle, but we're really looking at households, what todo to get households out there spending now.
So we've got the facilities and the funding in place for businesses to get through this.
What we need now are canadianconsumers to get out there and to start spending it. and not just through mortgage savings or credit card savings from lower interest rates.
So next week looking at what are the different measures that the finance Minister will use.
We'll look at quantum's in the tens of billions so he announced$10 billion today and we thank we need a stimulus package of at least $20 billion to at least stave off a recessionary type of scenario over the course of theyear.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, rebekahyoung, thank you so much and thank you.
The director of economic and fiscal policy at scotiabank.



> all right, Vassy kapelos, the host of "power & politics" is joining me as does davidcochrane, there in the westblock.
Good to see you both.
So I wasn't crazy -- that was an unprecedented big move for those three institutions, including the finance Minister, to come together and to announce what the governor of the bank ofcanada pol oz said was a powerfulpackage.
Vassy, what stood out for you in terms of the significant measures they're trying to do to shore up the economic system writ large?



**Vassy**:

Yeah, you'reabsolutely right to characterize it as unprecedented.
I have never seen them all sitting there all at once.
I think that it signals a lot ofthings.
We have seen this through many of the economists in the big banks in the last 12 hours or so and predicting a recession in this country as a result of everything that is going on. Now the Minister was asked that specifically and didn't reallysay.
That there's going to beone.
But it shows that there's heightened level of concern where the stability of the economy is concerned.
These measures are directed atthat.
Now you brought up a really interesting point in your last question and I think for me is something that the big question mark kind of hangs over and that is exactly what they'll do for that group of people who are affected by the announcements that we're seeing today.
Those announcements being stayhome, don't travel, don't go toschool, stay home with yourkids.
There are a lot of people who are not covered by their employers in order to do so. Now the Minister as you said did indicate that that would be at least part of a very big stimulus package announced nextweek.
But we don't know exactly what those measures are.
and I didn't really get a clear answer on why that stuffcouldn't be announced today.
Why couldn't there be something in what was announced today directed at those people who are today looking at, you know, looking at their TV and saying that I have to stay home for the next three weeks with My kid and don't know if My job will cover that.



**Rosemary**:

It might be because they don't have theanswer.
Because it seems that they'reputting this together as they go along and as things come about.
I guess that some of those measures allow people to borrow money at a lower rate andthere's more money to borrow.
But I take your point that ifthey're trying to target --



**Vassy**:

That's what the governor said, right.
The idea of stimulus, it's not going to necessarily work the same way because the message from public health officials is to stay home and that's one thatwe'll think about next week.
But it will help them to enter -- you know, if they want to get a mortgage it will beeasier.
and it won't work as in the 2008crisis but still some effect.
Something targeted towards those people who can't take sick days.
That's the one thing that we'rewaiting for.
The Minister, to be fair, says that it's coming.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
David, Vassy's point there, think that it's a point that you have been thinking about too.
How do you have stimulus if people are not out there spending money because theycan't. I have about a minute.



**Reporter**:

a couple thingshere.
They have signalled from the prime Minister this morning to all of the people here with billmorneau today that direct transfers to Canadians are on the table and will likely be part of this stimulus package.
What this is about today is sending stability to the market sand the bank system to make money available and cheaper and to ensure people that the bank swill play nice during difficulttimes.
It's a signal to not count on the budget.
It's an event and every day is an event right now and you'llsee announcements from the finance Minister to respond tothings.
But they do have a plan.
They just want it to be accurate to the situation on the ground and the response -- sort of the response is appropriate.
So the stimulus package nextweek.
and all of the indications are very clear that direct transfers to Canadians to keep them secure are going to be a big part ofthat.



**Rosemary**:

Hello, I'm rosemarybarton, and this is special live coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, what it means for you, and what the government isdoing, what the federal government is doing to try to deal with the outbreak.
We're also, though, at this hour, watchingwashington, where United States president trump is expected to declare national emergency in thatcountry.
We will, of course, carry those remarks live for you as well.
Let me bring you up tospeed, in terms of what has happened in this country today.
An extraordinary event and extraordinary measures announced by the government today.
Whether it be are commendation from the public health agency to cancel all non-essentialtravel, and last hour, some significant moves forthe economy of thiscountry.
Both by the financeminister, freeing up $10billion for businesses toborrow.
Another rate cut by thebank of Canada, the secondin less than to weeks.
and a measure by thesuperintendent offinancial institutions toallow banks to lend moreeasily.
and this coming justbefore we are expected tohear from the governmentnext week about what theprime Minister called asignificant fiscalstimulus package.
The Prime Minister, as youmay have heard, isself-isolating at thistime because his wife, sophie gregoire-trudeau, is self-isolating.
He spoke from just outsidehis home.
Here her he is now.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Yesterday is hared with you that mywife, Sophie tested forcovid-19. and that test did comeback positive.
Her symptoms remain mild, but we're following medical advice and taking every precaution.
She will remain in isolation for the timebeing.
We're thinking about all of the families across the country who have received the same diagnosis.
But we're in good hands.
We have full confidence incanada's health officials.
Upon My doctor'srecommendation, I will remain in self-isolationfor 14 days.
I want to be clear, I haveno symptoms and I'mfeeling good.
and technology allows meto work from home.
Of course it is aninconvenience and somewhatfrustrating.
We are all social beings, after all.
But we have to do this.
Because we have to protectour neighbours and ourfriends, especially ourmore vulnerable seniors, and people withpreexisting conditions.
We are following medicaladvice, as should allcanadians.
On that note, I want tothank all of Canada'shealth professionals andthe public health agency, who are doing anincredible job supportingand looking after all ofus.




Prime Minister justintrudeau:[speaking throughinterpreter]I want to take the time tothank all public healthofficials and the publichealth agency of Canada's, who are doing exemplarywork.
Yesterday I had adiscussion with a numberof international leaders,, including president trumpof the United States, Prime Minister johnson, and Prime Minister contiin italy.
I also took part in themeeting of the specialcabinet committee meetingon COVID-19, and I hadtelephone conversationswith finance ministerswith respect to thecurrent economicsituation.
I had an opportunity totalk to the c. E.o. Of thechamber of commerce andthe president of thec.
L.c. This morning I had acabinet meeting, and ispoke to president macronof france.
Earlier today ministerblair's, hajdu, didannounce we arerecommending thatcanadians avoidnon-essential traveloutside the country.
We also announced that thecruise ship season will besuspended until July, andthat we will be tighteningcontrol measures atairports.
We will also be looking tobetter controlinternational passengersarriving in Canada.
[end of translation]



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Bill morneau has announced canadianscurtail non-essentialinternational travel, andthe cruise season issuspended until July.
and we're bringing inadditional screeningmeasures at artists.
and we are streamliningoverseas arrivals to bebetter positioned forscreening.
Yesterday we saw manyprovinces take strongsteps to keep people safe.
They're doing what needsto be done to protect thepublic, and I want tothank them.
Later today I will have acall with the premiers andthe indigenous leaders todiscuss the latestdevelopments andcoordinate our efforts, including the over billiondollar COVID-19 responsefund, which provides moneyto the provinces andterritories to supportpreparation andmitigation.
These are significantsteps.
and we will do more.
The provinces andterritories are facingvarious levels of risk, but we will make sure wealign our response acrossthe country.
Addressing COVID-19 mustbe a team Canada effort.
To keep Canadians safe, tomitigate the economicimpacts of the virus, alllevels of government areworking together.
We are talking regularly.
We are coordinating ourefforts.
We're following thesituation very closely, and we're pulling out all of the stops.
I know that you'reworried.
You're worried about yourhealth, about yourfamily's health, aboutyour job, your savings, about paying rent, about the kids not being inschool.
I know that you'reconcerned aboutuncertainty in the globaleconomy.
The steps being taken tokeep you safe have aneconomic impact.
But what is also true isthat we are in theenviable position ofhaving significant fiscalfire-power available tosupport you.
This is in addition to themeasures we've alreadytaken.
The finance Minister isalso in constantcommunication with hisinternational counterpartsto find ways to worktogether to mitigate theimpacts of the virus onthe global economy.
He will have furtherannouncements shortly thisafternoon.
The agreement we reachedwith other parties tosuspend the house todayalso still gives us theflexibility to do thethings we need to do inorder to supportcanadians.
No one should have toworry about paying rent.



That is the Prime Minister speaking earlier today from his home atrideau cottage.
Obviously looking to reassure Canadians on couple of fronts.
On his own health, which he says he doesn't have any symptoms and has not been tested for the virus.
As well as what the things people are thinking abouttoday, whether it be their wallets or whether it be their own health.
and the government is fighting all of this on those two fronts, both from the public healthperspective, making an umber of significant moves today, but also on an economic front.
and we are expecting mo remeasures to be announced at the beginning of nextweek.
We are standing by to hear from United States president donaldtrump in the comingmoments.
He, as well, is expected to move more aggressively to try to fight the outbreak of COVID-19 in his country.
That expected to be financial measures as he declares a national state of emergency there.
Vassy kapelos is the host of "power and politics," and she joins me as she has been throughout theday, for a special coverage today.
I do think that the government is, as I said, Vassy, trying to do this on a couple of fronts.
Obviously there are different thingshappening.
and the outbreak of the virus is causing all of these economicconsequences.
and also trying, obviously, to protectcanadians and theirhealth.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I think you can look back over the past four hours, and so much has happened.
First on the public healthfront, we've got an official federal government advisory sayingdon't travel outside ofcanada.
That is different fromyesterday, and even different from earlier this morning, because some provinces were sayingdon't do it, and others saying if you do, you'vegot to isolate.
Now we have sort of anational, you could almost call it a directive.
and we heard the Prime Minister there talk aboutit, things like suspending the cruise season, and the other big one we'rewaiting specifics on is closing down or diminishing the number of airports that international flights can come from.
We don't know which flights or exactly fromwhere.
and I spoke to a colleague at the Calgary airport, and they still don't know.
All of those measures certainly aimed at the containment of the virus, where the health aspect of all of this is involved.
On the economic front, that leaves us all to thatparte, which we just heard from Minister morneau, and rate cut from the key lending rate from the bank of Canada, a big push to allow banks to basically lend out more money, and they have a whole lot more money to do so with, and$10 billion for businesses that need to borrow money.
Still nothing on people who have to take sick day sand aren't caused, but the government is saying there is a big significant package coming, and no word on the budget at thispoint.



It doesn't sound like the budget is necessarily needed right now.
The priority is to deal with the impact of the virus and trying to mitigate for that.
The other thing that struck me today, Vassy, was the health Minister, patty hajdu, talking about how this is a key moment of containment.
There are still not that many cases in thiscountry.
175 or so confirmed cases, when I last looked.
That is not a huge number.
But the idea is if you let things get out of control, that number can also start to spiral out of control.
That's really why they'rethrowing so much at thistoday, I think.



**Vassy**:

Very much so. We heard her use the word crisis and emergency.
Even though that number looks small -- I heard Lady at the airport say this is all hype by themedia.
It is not.
The government is very clearly saying you have todo this stuff now so itdoesn't get worse later because it will if wedon't.



**Rosemary**:

and we haveseen, as you say, through the week things have started to ramp up. Whether it be earlier in the week, a billion dollar package to deal with some health measures, including$500 million for provinces to help them gather equipment and be prepared.
I should say that this call that the Prime Minister referred to in that tape, the conversation with the premiers has happened, andi'm sure he will have further conversations.
We're standing by this hour to hear from president Donald trump.
For 30 days the United States was going to ban travelers from Europe, with the exception of its owncitizens, although that had to be clarifiedearlier.
That was a huge move thatdonald trump didn't tell anybody about.
He didn't alert Canada, hedidn't alert the e. U. there have been lot of questions about the impact of that or whether it signals something forcanada.



**Vassy**:

Our attention will focus there in the coming hours because you never know what the president is going to say.
When he made the announcement youmentioned, nobody knew, not even the countries that were affected.
We understand it will be reported that he is going to declare a state ofemergency.
and that will have impacts as well.
Will there be further announcements that followthat? and what about the concerns on this side of the border in the ways Otis not happening that the virus is being contained in the United States, a lack of testing and concern about the rate of the spread of that virus in the United States has a lot of consequences for the way in which this federal government deals with our borders and deals with containment measuresthere.
So I think that what the president says and how he deals with this, ordoesn't deal with it, is hugely significant as to how the virus ends up impacting this country.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, thankyou, Vassy.
Thank you so much for your help with that.
As we were talking about, the bank of Canada made some moves today, too, cutting its key overnight interest rates to .75% in response to COVID-19, the second cut in less than two weeks.
Bank of Canada stevenpoloz made the announcement in a joint conference with billmorneau.
and he outlined some of what will be in the stimulus package that is expected at the beginning of next week.
Take a listen.



The government ofcanada is preparing significant stimulusprogramme to be released next week, to stabilize our economy, to supportbusinesses, and to protectcanadians during difficult time.
As a first step, today I'mannouncing that we are establishing our credit facility programme to support businesses and to stimulate the economy.
This will make $10 billion available in additional support for canadianbusinesses through the business development bank of Canada and export development Canada.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That's bill morneauearlier today.
a series of measures announced between the bank of Canada, the for instance Minister, and the superintendent of financial institutions Ina very unusual move for those three entities to come together, as an attempt to try to shore up the financial system in the country.
David Cochrane has been following that part of the story as well, and he is in the west block that.
So this was to do onething, and we're expecting another thing next week.
Let's start maybe on what was announced today and the goals behind that, David.



**David**:

Today you saws one, two, three punch, punch.
Bill morneau makes $10billion available to small and medium-sizedbusinesses.
Stephen poloz, the bank ofcanada, announced they'recutting interest rates bya half percentage point, and so this money becomescheaper.
and jeremy routen, thehead of financialinstitutions, he allowsthe core banks in thiscountry to dip into theirrainy day to make moneymore widely available.
Putting $300 million inextra lending capacityinto the country.
You're seeing themultiplier effect ofcoordinated action.
We never really see themtogether.
This is a signal that thisis a very urgent time, andalso that they have a veryserious and thought-outplan.
Because those three mendon't sit at one tableannouncing a coordinatedevent unless they've had alot of time to prepare forit and coordinate.
Jeremy routen, his officewas shut down this week.
The workers were told tostay home because ofcoronavirus fears.
So it just shows you, thework is going on on theeconomy, in the face of aserious health emergency.



**Rosemary**:

and thatappearance, as well as, should say the appearance of the Prime Minister, did have an immediate marketimpact.
You don't expect that everything will, but sometimes just seeing someone doing their job provides some confidence, and that's in part what today was about.
So the second part ofthis, that is to come nextweek, David, we should expect it to be focused on individuals and the kinds of things they will need?



**David**:

The stimulus is what they say is coming next week.
This is stabilizing and making things available.
So there were a lot of signals in that, even though there weren'tspecifics.
and I would expect that the markets are rebounding those signals as well.
There is a clear signal from the Prime Minister, when he spoke outsiderideau cottage, and the only real thing was the waiving and job-sharingexpansion measures sopeople don't get laid off.
But cash in your pocket topay your rent, pay yourmortgage, to pay for childcare, if that's what youneed, that will be part ofthe stimulus measure, itseems pretty clear.
and then there islong-term, will there bestructure -- it is not in2008, where there was afinancial meltdown, yougive people money and theycan go out and spend.
We're in an age ofbroad-based self-isolationand distancing.
This is not the sort ofthing that can happen.
But they're trying to puta floor under things witha lot of these measures sopeople know that the basicaspects of day-to-day lifeshould be okay.
Canadians shouldn't gobroke and businessesshouldn't go under.
and that's the messagethey're trying to conveytoday.



**Rosemary**:

May ire commend online shopping.



**David**:

Someone has to deliver it, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

That'sright.
As we look at the markets, things are trending up Little bit.
Thursday was the worst day for the t. S.x. In decades.
The markets, in large, have been a roller coasterfor everyone since aboutmonday.
If you're worried aboutyour investments, maybenot a great time to lookat them.
If you want to stay insome state of denial, butticking positive in thet.
S.x., and that probably in lighter of the measureswe're seeing.
If there is an asserted effort to provide confidence for theeconomy, people will start believing that and the markets will reflect it. That's what you're seeingthere.
We are, at this hour, standing by to hear from the United States president donaldtrump, expected to hold press conference thereshortly, and we'reexpecting him to declare national state ofemergency.
That is a rarely used presidential power, but it would allow him to ta pinto a significant amount of money.
and to have --[no audio]



**IT IS INTERESTING, WEHAVE A NATIONAL STATE OFEMERGENCY ABOUT TODECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT, AND WHAT THAT DOES ISESSENTIALLY IT IS SORTEROF A BUREAUCRATIC THING. IT SOUNDS QUITE OMINOUS, BUT IN FACT, WHAT IT DOESIS FREE UP MONEY IN ADISASTER RELIEF FUND. THERE IS ABOUT $42.6BILLION IN THAT FUND. THIS IS SOMETHINGDEMOCRATS AND A NUMBER OFOFFICIALS HAVE BEENCALLING FOR FOR DAYS. THIS WILL BE USED BY FEMATO BE DISBURSED TO STATESTHAT WERE HIT THE HARDEST. THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TOPAY FOR SOME OF THE THINGSTHEY ARE TRYING TO DO TOMITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THEVIRUS. THEY MAY BE SETTING UPMOBILE HEALTH AREAS, ASWELL AS TO PAY FORWORKERS. AND BILL CLINTON DID ITFOR THE WEST NILE VIRUS, BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT$5 MILLION THAT WASRELEASED. THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RELOOKING TO HEAR FROM THEPRESIDENT WHEN HE DOESSPEAK. WE'LL BE LOOKING FORWARDTO THAT, AND SEEING WHATELSE HE HAS TO SAY, ESPECIALLY ABOUT TESTING. THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT HASBEEN REALLY ON THEFOREFRONT OF PEOPLE'SMINDS HERE**:

Why hasn't the United States been testing as often and frequently as othercountries, given the health care system here.
There are reports that trump himself may not have been pushing for that because he didn't want the numbers to go higher.
Many health officials here saying we don't have Strong enough grasp on how widespread the virus is here because testinghasn't been done.
In new York state, they say they have been partnering with privatelabs, and they have got permission from the f. D.a. and others to do testing, but there are still a lotof questions and anecdotalreports that people aren'tgetting tests when theyare received.
Interesting to hear whatthe president is going to say about testing, andoverall, it will beinteresting to hear thetone then presidentdelivers.
When he delivered hisaddress earlier this week, he stuck to the script, but even as he stuck to the script, he mademistakes that he, himself, and other officials had tocorrect later on, and thatled to a dip in themarkets and otherquestions.
Whether or not he, himself, is taking thisseriously.
and in addition to all ofthe information, the tonethe president delivershere is going to be asimportant as well.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
It has been a marked difference between whatwe're seeing there and what we're seeing here.
Press conferences, where the public health officers provincially or federally are always present, and the politicians are deferring to them and to science in order to have the questions answered.
There is a high level of transparency around the number of tests.
Part of that, I think, is the lessons learned fromsars, certainly.
But part of it is just the way our country functions slightly differentlythere.
How has that made everything morechallenging? if I can ask you thatquestion, the fact that it has been sort of laden with political rhetoric and even falsehoods about what is actuallyhappening?



**Reporter**:

It isinteresting.
There is a hugedisconnect.
Here in new York state, we have daily updates from the governor, Andrew cuomoand the mayor, billmayor.
and you see this from thecoronavirus taskforceheaded by mike pence.
But you see the president questioning the numbers saying how come the flu has killed more people andwe're not focusing onthat.
and how come the obamaadministration did this back then and we're not focusing on that.
You were the president essentially going against his own experts.
He was touring the c. D.c., and his own experts werethere beside him tryingnot to correct him when he was deliveringmisinformation, about thefact that testing isperfect, and everyone whowants it can get a test.
So you see theseofficials, especially withtrump and in other mediaappearances, trying not toangering the president bycontradicting hisinformation, but stilltrying to get correctinformation out to thepublic.
So they're walking a veryfine line.
When you have thepresident coming out tospeak, and some of thereporters who are in therose garden now sayingthere isn't ateleprompter.
and so when the presidentspeaks off the cuff, younever know what he isgoing to say.
Especially in thesescenarios, where you needvery precise, verycredible information.
We have already seen thepresident tripping overhis own words in preparedstatements.
You know, anything canhappen, and that's notwhat you want in asituation like this.



**Rosemary**:

I think he had a teleprompter in the oval office earlier thisweek, and that didn't seem to protect him fromerrors.
We are expecting the president to emerge veryshortly.
So if I cut you off, Steven, that is what is happening there.
One of the other things that I'm sure is in the back of everyone's mind as they watch the president deal with this is the fact that there is presidential election coming up. and surely the sat of the statefthe markets is sort of what he banked on, in manyways, in terms of hisre-election.
So he needs to find a wayto contain and stabilizethings.



**Reporter**:

We've seen that in so many of his public comments.
It is tied to how the markets are performing.
When the markets are goinggood, he tends to delivery message of positivity.
He said, we'll be through this very soon, or the number of cases isn'tgoing to go up. and then the scene gets more serious when the markets dip and he tries to recover there.
a number of people aresaying, what is the president really concernedabout? is it the health and safety of Americans, or is it his own politicalfortunes? we saw that even with the issue with the cruise ship in California, where he said going against the expert recommendations, and they were saying that those people should be brought off the ship and into quarantine.
and he said he didn't want them to come off the ship because it would affect the numbers.
and he didn't want the numbers to go up because in his mind the numbers going up reflects bad on how the United States is handling things and perhaps leads to the markets going down.
How politics plays into this can't be ignored.



**Rosemary**:

Such Stark contrast to the way things have unfolded heretoday.
I don't know if you sawearlier, we had all of the leaders and house leaders of all of the parties standing together at microphone saying, yes, we're going to shut down parliament untilapril 20th, and we'regoing to fast-track nafta.
Just because there is anunderstanding of theseriousness of thesituation.
What we're expecting tohear from the United States president is he willdeclare a national stateof emergency, which willmean he can tap into -- ithink it is $40 billion --



**Reporter**:

$42.6billion.



**Rosemary**:

There yougo.
It always means that femastarts to coordinate measures between thestates.
We've seen fem called in at different times, but this would be significant development for the United States.
Let me just bring people up to date on a couple of significant developments in this country.
I'm just noticing right now that Manitoba has decided that it is going to close schools in that province for three weeks, starting March 23rd, and that would fall in line with Manitoba's springbreak, which is not unlike what Ontario is doing.
Ontario schools shutting for three weeks as of the end of day today.
Manitoba deciding to do that now as well.
Quebec also made that decision earlier today.
and we've seen throughout the day today many, many different universities and colleges following suit.
So this is obviously going to be something that impacts you at home.



**Reporter**:

Rosie, if could jump in on that.
The school issue is a bi gone here in the United States right now it is a hugedebate, and probably at the forefront of the debate in new York city because the new yorkschool system has more than a million children inthere.
and people are asking, whyhaven't schools been shutdown with school boards across the country, especially in Canada, are shutting down.
and the governor and the mayor have said this is where kids are being able to be taken care of, they have free food programmesfor lunch and breakfast.
If you're a doctor ornurse, a health careworker, what can you do if your kids are at home? it is a big debate on whether or not to close the schools, and theofficials, for right now, are saying keep them open.



**Rosemary**:

The president is coming out of the white house, and he is accompanied by mike pence.
Steven, we'll come back to you when the president has finished speaking.
Taking you live to the president of the United States in Washington.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much, everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
a beautiful day in the rose garden.
I appreciate everybody being here.
Today I would like to provide an update to theamerican people on several decisive new actions we'retaking in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat thecoronavirus.
We've been working very hard on this.
We've made tremendousprogress.
When you compare whatwe've done to other areas of the world, it's prettyincredible.
a lot of that had to do with the early designation and the closing of theborders.
and, as you know, europewas just designated as the hot spot right now, and we closed that border a whileago.
So that was lucky -- it was through talent orluck, call it whatever youwants.
But through a very collective action and shared sacrifice and national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus.
I also announced wednesdaynight, following the advice of our medicalprofessionals, who are doing a tremendous job --we appreciate it very much -- tesuspending the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last14 days from entering the United states.
Citizens, residents, an dour families -- any of the families returning fromeurope will be subject to extra screening, as well as self-isolation for a period of 14 days, as theworld health organizationconfirmed today, many ofthe things of what we saidwere 100% correct, including our designation, before them, of europe.
Like our earlier veryaggressive actions withchina, this measure willsave countless lives.
I appreciate a number ofthe folks behind me, anumber of the peoplebehind me said that saveda lot of lives, that earlydesignation.
But it is only thebeginning of what we'rereally doing.
Now we're in a differentphase.
We had some veryold and obsolete rules wehad to live with, and itworked under certaincircumstances, but notunder mass circumstances.
They were in place for along time, and we'rebreaking them down now.
and they're very usablefor certain instances, butnot for this.
To unleash the full powerof the federal government, I'm officially declaring anational emergency.
Two very big words.
The action I am takingwill open up access to upto $50 billion of veryimportant and a largeamount of money for statesand territories andlocalities in our sharedfight against thisdisease.
and I'm urging every stateto stet up emergencyoperation centersimmediately.
You'll be hearing fromsome of the largestcompanies and greatestretailers and medicalcompanies in the world, who are standing rightbehind me and aside of me. and I'm asking everyhospital to activate anemergency preparednessplan so they can meet theneeds of americanseverywhere.
The hospitals are veryengaged.
New york and various otherplaces are also variouslyengaged.
I just spoke with governorcuomo, and we had a verygood conversation, andwe're working verystrongly with many states, including new york.
The emergency orders I amissuing today will alsoconfirm broad newauthority to the secretaryof health and humanservices.
The secretary of h. H.s. Will be able toimmediately waiveprovisions of applicablelaws and regulations togive doctors and allhospitals and health careproviders maximumflexibility to respond to the virus and care forpatients.
This includes thefollowing criticalauthorities: the abilityto waive laws to enabletelehealth, a fairly newand incredible thing thathas happened in the not sodistant past.
I'll tell you, whatthey've done withtelehealth is incredible.
It gives remote doctorsvisits and hospitalcheck-ins, the power towaive certain federallicence requirements sothat doctors from otherstates can provideservices in states withthe greatest need.
Number two, the ability towaive requirements thatcritical access hospitalslimit the number of bedsto 25, and the length ofstay to 96 hours.
The ability to waive therequirements of athree-day hospital stayprior to admission to anursing home.
a big thing.
The authority to waive therules to hinder hospitals' ability to bringadditional physicians onboard or obtain neededoffice space.
They can do as they want.
They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don't have anyproblem getting it done.
The authority to waiverules that severelyrestrict where hospitalscan care for patientswithin the hospitalitself, ensuring that theemergency capacity can bequickly established.
We'll remove or eliminateevery obstacle to deliverour people the care thatthey need and that they'reentitled to. No resource will bespared, nothing witnessesso far.
10 days ago I broughttogether c. E.o. S ofcommercial labs at thewhite house and directedthem to immediately beginworking on a solution todramatically increase theavailability of tests.
Other countries havecalled us and worked withus, and they're doingsimilar things, or will bedoing similar things.
As a result of thataction, today we'reannouncing a newpartnership with privatesectors to vastly increaseand accelerate ourcapacity to test for thecoronavirus.
We want to make sure thatthose who need a test canget a test very safely, quickly, and conveniently.
But we don't want peopleto take a test if we feelthat they shouldn't bedoing it. and we don't want everyonerunning out and taking it. Only if you have certainsymptoms.
Using federal emergencyauthorities, the f. D.a. Approved a new test forthe virus.
We did this within hoursafter receiving theapplication from rouche.
We expect a half millionadditional tests will beavailable.
We'll be announcinglocations probably onsunday night.
I would like to thankrouche.
It will go very quickly.
It is going very quickly.
Which will bringadditionally 1.4 milliontests on board next week, and 5 million within amonth.
I doubt we'll needanywhere near that.
At the same time, we'vebeen in discussions withpharmacies and retailersto make drive-throughtests available in thecritical locationsidentified by publichealth locations.
The goal is forindividuals to be able todrive up and be swabbedwithout having to leaveyour car.
I want to thank google.
Google is helping todevelop a website.
It's going to be veryquickly done, unlikewebsites of the past, todetermine whether a testis warranted and tofacilitate testing at anearby convenientlocation.
We have many, manylocations behind us, by the way.
We covered this countryand large parts of theworld, by the way.
We're not going to betalking about the worldright now, but we coververy strongly our country.
Stores in virtually everylocation.
Google has 1, 700 engineersworking on this right now.
They've made tremendousprogress.
Our overriding goal is tostop the spread of thevirus and to help allamericans who have beenimpacted by this.
Again, we don't wanteverybody taking thistest.
It is totally unnecessary.
and this will pass.
This will pass through andwe're going to be evenstronger for it. We've learned a lot, atremendous amount has beenlearned.
I want to thank debraburkes, and I want her tocome up and say a fewwords as Tom what ishappening.
Dr. Burkes is a highlyrespected person, I'vegotten to know very wellover the last six days, and what we've done isbuilt something that isvery old, old-fashionedand certainly obsoletewhen it comes to the kindof numbers we're talkingabout -- Dr. Burkes, please.
Thank you, debra.



Thank you, Mr. President.
It is a pleasure to be here with all of you.
I think you know at the beginning of thisepidemic, h. H.s. Through c. D.c., built an app built on the existing flu surveillance system.
That surveillance system was then converted to diagnostic system.
But last Tuesday, seeing the spread of the virus around the globe, the president realized that our current approach to testing was inadequate to meet the needs of theamerican public.
He asked for an entire overhaul of the testingapproach.
He immediately called the private sector laboratories to the whitehouse, as noted, and charged them with developing a high-qualityplatform that can meet theneeds of the americanpublic.
We're grateful to lab corpand quest for taking upthe charge immediatelyafter the meeting, andwithin 72 hours bringingtesting to washingtonstate and california andnow across the country.
and we're very grateful to the universities and largehospital systems that tookup the charge to developtheir own quality tests, made available by newf.
D.a. Guidance.
This has resolved inexpanding testing acrossnew york, california, washington and colorado.
and you see thedrive-through options madeavailable.
Following the meeting lastweek, major commerciallaboratory equipment anddiagnostic companies tookimmediate action to adoptand develop new systems.
Rouchemoved from requestto development to approvedin record time.
This focused on providingconvenient testing tohundreds of thousands ofamericans within shorttornado-around times.
In less than two weekstogether, we havedeveloped a solution thatwe believe will meet thefuture testing needs ofamericans.
I understand how difficultthis has been.
I was part of the hiv/aidsresponse in the '80s.
We knew from first findingcases in 1981, it took usto almost 1985 to have atest.
It took us another 11years to have affectivetherapy.
It is because of thelessons learned from thatwe were able to mobilizeand bring the individualskey to the h. I.v. Responseto this response.
I understand that a lot ofthis behind the scenesaction over the lastcouple of weeks wasinvisible to the press andthe american people.
But this intense efforthas not only resulted in ininnovative solutions butin automated systems, bringing the availabilityof these qualitycoronavirus testing toamerican people atunprecedented speed.
Finally, I want you toknow in south korea, theydid have a large number oftests available over thelast several weeks.
Their positivity rate isbetween 3% and 4%. with lab corps andrequest, the positivityrate is between 1% and 2%. we want to announce thisnew approach to testing, which will start in thescreening website, uphere, facilitated bygoogle, where people ofinterest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire, move down for symptoms andrisk factors, yes, andthey would move down thisand be told where thedrive-through optionswould be for them toreceive this test.
The labs will move to thehighest automated machinesto be able to provideresults in 24 to 36 hours.
We have seen it work, justin our own United States, and we want to bring thisacross the continent.
Thank you very much.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much, Debra.
I'd like to maybe have tony -- I think everybody knows you pretty well.
Tony has been doing tremendous job workinglong, long hours, and this has been a great experience and working with you has beenterrific.
Tony, please.



Thank you very much, Mr. President.
This is an example of another -- another example of what I've been referring to in my discussions with many of you in the audience, as apro-active, leaningforward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of ofthe curve.
What you've seen with thisorder is we're going to be able to remove theconstraints so that peopleat the state, the locallevel, the individualphysician, all the way upthrough the federalgovernment, will have asmany constraints aspossible removed for themto do everything theypossibly can, so that we can implement the thingsthat we've been talkingabout.
The containment, themitigation, so that as isaid many times, thatcurve that I refer to thatgoes up, we don't want to have that curve.
We want to suppress itdown to that small mound.
I think what we've donetoday is something thatwill be a very importantelement in having us besuccessful in doing that.
We still have a long wayto go. There will be many mowersmany morecases, but we'll take eof that, and ultimately, as the president said, itwill end.
and what is going on heretoday will make it endsooner than it would have.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much, tony.
If I could -- some of these folks we know, they're celebrities in their own right, the greatretailers, and one is dougfrom wal-mart.
I'd like to have you say afew words.



When we got the call yesterday from the whitehouse, we were eager todoour part to help thecountry.
We've been asked to make portions of our parking lots available in select locations and scaling overtime as supply increases, so people can experience the drive-throughexperience.
We will do everything we can from the supply-chainpoint of view to do whatwe can.
Thank you very much.



**President Trump**:

Richard, if you could comeup.

Thank you, Mr. President.
Similar to Doug andwal-mart, we're happy tostand in here and help incommunities all acrossamerica.

We look forward to workingwith the administration todo our fair share toalleviate this growingthreat.
So thank you for includingus today.
In the near term, we'reall committed to makingsure we are keeping ourstores open, to serve theamerican consumer, who isstocking up on key foodand beverage items, andmaking sure we run safestores, and creating anenvironment that is safefor our team members.
Thank you very much.



**President Trump**:

We're one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus.
We're ramping up our manufacturing capacity to ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address thisissue.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much.
Steven rocowski, questdiagnostics.



Thank you very much, Mr. President.
As mentioned, we we recalled through the leadership of the vicepresident, last week to come together as anindustry.
We took advantage of that opportunity to work with the f. D.a., and we workedwith the center fordisease control, and we'reup and running with tests in a number of ourfacilities.
As the presidentmentioned, we now havecapabilities from rouchediagnostics we'll bringinto our facilities thisweekend.
I know myself and mycolleague at lab corpswill be doing the same.
So it will be considerablyincreased in the next fewweeks.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much.
and matt sauce, please, ofrouche.



Thank you, Mr. President.
So from rouche, we want to thank the f. D.a. Fortheirrapid approval ourcoronavirus test.
We appreciate thepartnership with thec.
D.c. and f. D.a. To getthat to market as fast aspeople.
It is critical to make itavailable to help patients in need, and working withlaboratories to get it upand going in the nearfuture.
It will bring hundreds ofthousands of testsavailable to patients inneed in the United States.
So thank you.



**President Trump**:

And you can do it. You can do it. a great company.
David Pierre of signifyhealth, please.



Thank you, Mr. President.
We are the largesthouse-call provider in theUnited States and we go to the homes ofthe most vulnerable, elderly.
and through our networkand our logistics engine, we stand ready to help andprovide our clinicians to be where they're needed, whether in retail clinicsor in the home.
and we're here to assist.
Thank you very much.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much.
We'll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for the future, should that is happen in thefuture, which we hope it never does, but it will, iguess, there are some bad ones over the years, and guess that will continue, to an extent.
We hope it never happens, but we're going to be changing a lot of the old rules and specification sand regulations.
Adam schector, lab corps, please.



Thank you, Mr. President.
At lab corps we're working every second of every day to increase the number of tests we can run.
We're working with our colleagues at quest, with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward.
I can tell you we understand how important the testing is, and we'recommitted to doing everything possible.



**President Trump**:

Thank you.
Great job.
Thomas Moriarty, c. V.s.



Thank you, Mr. President.
We have been focused, since the start, of making sure our patients and the costumers we serve have the information they need, the safety they need as well.
We're committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well.
and thank you, sir, for the honour.



**President Trump**:

Thank you.
Great job.
and Bruce quenstein, l. a. c. Group.



Mr. President, thank you for the honour of being here.
The home health industry has been treating patient sand seniors in the safety and comfort of their own home for decades.
We're very proud to be part of the testing in their own homes.
For Americans who can'tget to a test site, we'rehere to help and to partner with our hospital sand physicians, as well as with the people we have here today that will be testing around thecountry.
Thank you.



**President Trump**:

Thank you.
I like that.
That's good.
I'm also announcing the following emergency executive actions today.
To help our students and their families, I'vewaived interest on all student loans held by the federal governmentagencies, and that will be until further notice.
That's a big thing for allot of students that are left in the middle.
Many of the schools have been closed.
Based on the price of oil, I have instructed the secretary of energy topurchase, at a very goodprice, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the United States, strategicreserve.
We're going to fill it right up to the top, saving the americantaxpayer billions and billions of dollars, and helping our oil industry.
and helping us to that wonderful goal which weachieved, which nobody thought was possible, of energy independence.
We're buying it as the right price and puts us Ina position that is verystrong.
That is something that would not have been possible a week ago.
The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we'regoing to fill it up. It is a good time to fill it up. I'd like to ask mike pence to say a few words, please.
V.p.



Thank you, Mr. President.
It is -- this day should be an inspiration to everyamerican, because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole of government approach to confronting thecoronavirus, we'rebringing in all of americaapproach.
Mr. President, from earl yon you took decisiveaction, you suspended all travel from china, you created travel advisories.
South Korea and Italy --we screened travelers in all airports in both of those countries.
On the recommendation of your health experts, you, admit night tonight, willaffectively suspend all travel from Europe, andamericans that are returning will be screened and asked to voluntarily participate in a 14-dayquarantine.
Throughout this process, Mr. President, you put the health of America first.
But you brought the best of America to address it. and it's not just at the federal level.
As you said, Mr. President, we've been working with states across the country.
We issued broad guidelines from the c. D.c. For everyamerican.
This week at yourdirection, we tailoredspecific recommendationsfrom c. D.c. Forwashington, new york, california, and florida.
You have forced a seamlesspartnership with everystate and every territoryin this country.
and you put the health of our nation first.
But today I trust thatpeople around the countrythat are looking on atthis extraordinary publicand private partnership toaddress the issue oftesting with particularinspiration.
After you tapped me tolead the white housecoronavirus taskforce, Mr. President, you said, thisis all hands on deck, andyou directed us toimmediately move out to the american businesssector, to commerciallabs, to meet what we knewthen would be the need oftesting across thespectrum.
Today with this historicpublic-private foundation, we will meet that need.
By this Sunday evening, we'll be able to givespecific guidance on whenthe website will beavailable, you can go to the website, type in yoursymptoms, and be givendirection whether or not atest is indicated.
and then at the samewebsite, you'll bedirected to one of theseincredible companies thatare going to give a littlebit of their parking lotso that people can come byand do a drive-by test.
I want to join you inthanking wal-mart, walgreens, c. V.s., andpeople come together, andnow they're going to cometogether to meet the needsof the american public.
Lab corps and request androuche have done anincredibly job steppingforward, and they're goingto literally make hundredsof thousands of testsavailable and beingprocessed with results topatients in the very nearfuture.
But it is all as a resultof you tasking us withbringing together not justgovernment resources, which all state labs cantest across the country, and c. D.c. is testing, butyou said, Mr. President, you want to bring all ofthe resources of thecountry together, andthat's what thispartnership really means.
The truth is we havecoronavirus cases now in46 american states.
While the risk of seriousillness of the coronavirusremains low, we want toencourage every americanto practice common sense, practice good hygiene, go to the c. D.c.'s websiteand see what the guidanceis for your community orfor the american peoplebroadly.
AF the president has said, it is especially importantnow that we look aftersenior citizens withchronic underlying healthconditions.
Last week the presidentdirected the center formedicaid and medicareservices to raise thestandards for our nursinghomes, in crewsinspections at our nursinghomes.
and today we're offeringvery specific guidance, which we'll articulateabout visitation atnursing homes.
They were there for uswhen we were growing up, Mr. President.
They helped us with ourhomework.
They tucked us in atnight.
They cheered us on as wepursued educations, andnow it is time for us to be there for them and torecognize that seniorswith chronic healthconditions are the mostvulnerable, and americanscan make a difference.
So wash your hands, usecommon sense, look at thenursing homes.



Thank you.
Well, thank you to the president for thedeclaration.
It allows My agency, c. M.s., which runsmedicare and medicaid, tosuspend regulations thatcould get in the way oftreating patients duringthis time.
These temporary national, blanket waivers arereserved for the rarest ofcircumstances, and theyrepresent a massivemobilization of ourcountry's resources tocombat this terriblevirus.
and the flexabilities willbe a god-send on the front lines of this fight.
C.m. S. will givingguidance, to prevent allvisitors, with theexception of end of life.
This represents a severetrial for residents ofnursing homes and thosewho love them.
But we're doing what wemust to protect ourvulnerable elderly.
Thank you.



**President Trump**:

Thank you very much.
As I said in My address to the nation the othernight, all Americans have role to play in defeating this virus.
Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people an dour country and slow the spread of the virusitself.
The choice we make, the precautions we put intoplace, are critical to overcoming the virus.
[please stand by] with faith and heart and hope and love anddetermination, we will succeed, we will prevail, we will bevery, very successful, and we'lllearn for the future.
Thank you all very much.
If you have any questions, we can take some.
Go ahead, john, please.
and if you'd like to ask some of the folks up here would be fine, please.



Mr. President, where are you with the house bill? yesterday we talked to you in the oval office, you were opposed to it. What has happened since then andwhat's the hold-up on that?



Well, we just don't thinkthey're giving up. We don't think the democrats are giving enough.
We're negotiating.
We thought we had something bu tall of a sudden they didn'tagree to certain things that they agreed to. So we could have something but we don't think they're givingenough.
They're not doing what's right for the country.



and if I could ask --



Go ahead, please.



Thank you, Mr. President.
You just mentioned waiving interest for student loans, you talk about buying oil from thespr or adding to the spry, what other specific targeted measure sis your administration thinking about taking? the treasury secretary said today you're just in the second inning of things you might beundergoing?



**President Donald Trump**:

We are looking at many differentthings, as you know.
You know some of them have been written about very widely butwe're going to be releasing paper in about two hours stating quite a if you other steps, very important ones.
Please, go ahead.
Please, go ahead.



Thank you so much, Mr. President.
I want to know if you are in contact with the brazilianpresident after a member of his delegation who was with yousaturday was tested positive and also I want to ask anotherquestion, if you let me, senatorlindsay graham and also senator rick Scott are self-isolating.
Are you planning to take anykind of precautionary measuresto protect you and also test whowas there with him?



**President Donald Trump**:

No, we have no symptoms whatsoever, and we have -- we had a great meeting with the president ofbrazil, bolsonaro, great guy, very tremendous.
He's doing a fantastic job forbrazil.
and as you know, he testednegative, meaning nothing wrong, this morning, and we got thatword, too.
Because we did have dinner withhim, we were sitting next to each other for a long period oftime.



But are you in contact with him over the coronavirus crisis?



We're talking about itcountry-to-country, but we diddiscuss if he had a problem.
It was reported that he may haveit, and he doesn't, fortunately.



Thank you so much, Mr. President.
Dr. Fauci said a fault was the lag in testing, and when will you guarantee that everyone who needs a test will have a date?



**President Donald Trump**:

No, I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a differenttime.
It wasn't meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we're talkingabout.
and what we've done is redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behindme, and we're now in very, very strong shape.
I think we'll be announcing as is aid Sunday night, and this will start very quickly and we'llhave the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time.
So no. and what we have done, and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future in case something like this happens again, but it was -- andthat's not the fault of anybody, and frankly, the old system worked very well for smallernumbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind ofnumbers.
Tony, maybe you'd like to saysomething.



By Sunday night, will everyamerican be able to get a test?



Just to reiterate what I said to you many times, the system, the system was not designed for what it was designed for, it worked very well.
The CDC designed a good system.
If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrationis, you have to embrace the private sector and this is exactly what you're seeing because you can't do it withoutit.
So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need.
Now looking forward, the system will take care of it.



Mr. President --



**President Donald Trump**:

And if you go back, please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this.
They didn't do testing like this and actually they lost approximately 14, 000 people, and they didn't do the testing.
They started thinking about testing when it was far toolate.
What we've done and one of the reasons I think people are respecting what we've done, we've done it very early.
We've gotten it very early, andwe've also kept a lot of peopleout.



Mr. President --



Mr. President, the last administration said that they tested a million people at thispoint.



**President Donald Trump**:

Ask them how they did with the swineflu, it was a disaster.
Next, please.
Next please.
They had a very big failure with swine flu.
Very big failure.



I want to ask you about theeuropean travel ban that goes into effect at midnight tonight and the exemption that you'veoffered to the United Kingdom there are 17 countries that are in the so-called shengen zonewith fewer coronavirus casesthan the United Kingdom and just in thepast 24 hours, the United Kingdom hasadded 208 coronavirus cases totheir total.
Why do they, Mr. President, deserve an exemption and wouldyou consider adding them to thistravel ban list?



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, that was recommended to me by a group of professionals, and we are looking at it based on the new numbers that are comingout, and we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will you could say ban or whatever it is during this period of time.
But, yeah, their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours so we maybe adding that.
and we may be adding a couple ofothers, and we may frankly start thinking about taking some off.
Go ahead.



Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm a correspondent with hongkong phoenix TV. You have mentioned that the number in china has beendecreasing, china has made tremendous progress in the pastweeks.
I'm wondering, how much confidence does this give you to control the virus in the United States? and do you see the data china has been sharing with the United States has been helpful?



**President Donald Trump**:

Think it has been helpful.
We've been working very much with china.
I've spoken, as you know, with president xi. They went through hell.
and their numbers are starting to look very good.
They're really looking verygood, we're very happy aboutthat.
We are sharing data, yes.
In fact, we're sharing quite ab it of data, including the fact that some of our pharmaceutical companies are working over there right now with large groups ofpeople.
Yeah, go ahead, please.



Thank you, Mr. President.
You spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau yesterday.



**President Donald Trump**:

Yes, I did.



Did you discuss the potential closing of the border betweencanada and the United States, and byextension, are you considering ways to salvage the $2 billion daily trade between the twocountries?



**President Donald Trump**:

So we didn't discuss the border.
We've had a very goodrelationship.
Just about finished with theusmca, he called to tell methat.
I think that was the primary reason for the call at the time.
His wife had not been diagnosed, she's a wonderful lady, greatlady, and since then I've heard that the result was that she hasit.
and I was a little surprised.
I think he was surprised also.
We did discuss it prior to. She's going to be fine, but he thought that she would not most likely have the virus, unfortunately she does.
But we didn't discuss the borderyesterday, no. Go ahead, please.
If you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should, even a businessquestion, relate it to whatwe're talking about.



Mr. President, ABC news, Miami.
a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to thecruiseline industry and the travel industry that floridadepends upon and since senator rick Scott and Miami dad mayorcarlos Jimenez have the same exposure as you are and you areself-isolating, what's yourmessage to them, they shouldn'tbe?



**President Donald Trump**:

Idon't know about exposure, but idon't have the symptoms, and we have a white house doctor, many doctors frankly, and I asked them that question, and they said you don't have any symptomswhatsoever, and we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test.
The test is not insignificant.
As far as the cruiselinebusiness, we're with them all the way.
It's a great business, it's great United States business, frankly.
and I know how important they are to the country.
That includes airlines, but thecruiseline business, obviously, was hit very hard.
We had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it, vice-president pence did afantastic job with that.
We worked with United Kingdom, we workedwith Canada.
They took their people back incanada, approximately 600people.
U.k. Likewise took a largenumber of people back to the United kingdom.
and we have people quarantined.
It was a big operation and itworked out really -- you don'thear about it anymore, it workedout really well.
Mike, you may even want to saysomething about that.
That was really done properly.



Well, thank you, Mr. President.
and that program, the grandprincess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards, orderlyway, as the president directed, and Americans that needed treatment have received them.
I spoke to the governor of iowatoday and some of those who now have been cleared are able in proper supervision to be returning to Iowa, they'remaking arrangements for them todo that.
Others in Texas, others ingeorgia, again it's another example of the extraordinary cooperation governor Abbott, governor newsome, governor briankemp of Georgia but to add tothat, the president directed me last Saturday to travel down tomiami.
We met with all the leaders of the cruise line industry.
Several cruise lines have announced a 60-day pause inoperations.
Our department of homeland security has praised them for doing that because of the unique health challenges, particularly presented to seniors with underlying conditions.
We have a proposal from thecruiseline industry, but they'recurrently considering what other steps that they might take, perhaps even similar to what those other lines have taken.
We're anticipating some response on that in the next 24 hours, but as the president said, theamerican people cherish ourcruiseline industry, men and women who work on the ships, men and women who work on the shore, all the economists that are so benefited by a vibrantcruiseline industry, what the president directed us to do is whether there is a pause in themoment, as some cruise lines aredoing, and as we all continue todiscuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come throughthis, that cruise lines and the medical services that are available and for the passenger sand all of the crew that the cruise lines are saver than ever before and can prosper for many years to come.



**President Donald Trump**:

Goahead, please.



This question is for doctorsfauci and burkes.
Based on what you currently know what is the trajectory for when this outbreak will peak, how long will the American people have to remain on this emergencyfooting? and for Dr. Burkes, as the administration tries to get its arms around this test kit shortage issue, the next glaring issue could be respirators and hospital equipment? what is the administration doing now to ramp that up?



So when you have an outbreak like this, particularly ifyou're trying to interfere withit, it's really impossible to predict the time element of whenit's going to peak and naturally go down.
If you look at the situation where countries really did not get to the point of trying to contain and mitigate very well, you see a peak over several weeks and down again over another several weeks.
What we're trying to do is blunt that peak, and I mentioned it many times, and I think it'simportant and appropriate for me to mention it again, because it answers your question.
When you talk about preventing infections from without in, which is the kind of travel restrictions we're talkingabout, then how do you handle what you already have in yourcountry? you continue some sort of containment but you also domitigation.
and you try to proportion it to the areas where there are the most infections.
The success of that and how much you make this turn into this is going to give you the a. M. oftime.
If we're successful, it will beless.
If we're not successful, it'sgoing to be more.
But these kind of things generally run out in a fewmonths.
Hopefully we'll make it severalweeks, eight, nine, whateverweeks, but I can't give you an umber because it depends on how successful we are.



Great, thank you.
It's a great question, anddr.
Fauci and I have worked together a very long time and continue to be privileged to work with him every day.
So I think you can learn very --and I appreciate there were some graphics done by some of the reporting over the last severaldays.
If you align the data from china with the data with south Korea, you can start to see a complete overlay of that data and sothat's what we're tracking very closely as well as Italy.
But you have an excellentquestion.
I just want to make one note.
In south Korea, I want to repeat only 4% of those tests werepositive.
That means 96% of the people Hadar different respiratory disease.
Because we're in the middle of flu season, cold season, and all of the other respiratory diseases that we get every day.
In lab core requests every day, they're running 1 to 2%positive, that means we have allot more other respiratory disease out there besides thecoronavirus and that's the screening is critical.
But even with the screening, we're going to run what we think are very low rates.
Needless to say, though, we'retaking it extraordinarily seriously to plan for what couldcome.
Dr. Fauci talked about blunting the curve that makes it much less high need at the peak of the curve that we're all planning for so we're in full inventory of all of our assets by the president unlocking and this emergency order and the secretary of hhs's ability, it unlocks all of those stockpiles, those needs, what the v. a. has, what the DOD has, national guard and what every hospital has and the hospital emergency preparedness plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we're in full planning mode for each of those things.



and I might add that we're in the process, and in some case shave already done it, ordered large number of respirators Justin case.
We hope we don't need them butwe've ordered a large number.
Yeah, go ahead, please.



Thank you very much, Mr. President.
In your speech to the nation, you mention the situation in china and south Korea haveimprove, and you are thinking about remove the restrictions, also the warning in place rightnow.
When can we expect that announcement and how do you seethe overall progress that asiancountries made?



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, some are making progress, some are not as you know, but some are making progress, and as they make progress, as they get down to the number we all think is right, that they know isright, we know is right, we'llbe opening it up. and some are really moving alongrapidly.
We hope to be able to open things up as quickly aspossible.
Go ahead, please.
Go ahead.



Thank you, Mr. President.
I'd like to ask secretary azarand Dr. Fauci just how --dr. Fauci, all right.



**President Donald Trump**:

Nita hundred percent, but 90%, better, better.
Go ahead.



This affects the elderly, in that sense it's an unusualdisease.
is there any specific research being done why it affects our senior citizens more thanothers?



So I don't mean to diminish your question, but we already know why it would affect senior citizens more, because when you talk about anything that requires a robust immune system, as you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young.
and that's the reason why, when you talk about even influenza, which we have extraordinary experience with over decades anddecades, the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlyingconditions.
The same thing holds true for variety of other disease.
Why cancer is more prevalent in mostly older individuals, because the immune system that screens for it is less robust.
So it really is something that is kind of well-known over a lotof studies.



**President Donald Trump**:

Okay.
Oen, please.



Mr. President, the chineseofficials are expressing some tones of discontent with how --where the source of this virus has come from and they'respinning some odd narratives.
What are your response to thechinese officials who are doingthat? and have they signalled any kind of resistance to upcoming trade talks in response to how we'rehandling this virus?



**President Donald Trump**:

As far as our deal with china, they're going to be buying$250 billion worth of goods and50 billion from our farmers andit's a great deal for ourcountry, it's about time somebody did that.
and frankly, phase two will start negotiating.
I did read one article, but idon't think that article wasrepresentative, certainly not of my conversations with presidentxi.
and they know where it camefrom.
We all know where it came from.



Thank you, Mr. President.
PBS newshour.
My first question is you said you don't take responsibility but you did disband the white house pandemic office and officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly so what responsibility do you take tothat? and the officials that worked in that office said that the white house lost valuable time because that office was disbanded.
What do you make of that?



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, I just think it's a nasty question because what we've doneis, and tony has said numeroustimes, that we have saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing, and when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people.



Your administration.



**President Donald Trump**:

Myadministration, but I could perhaps ask tony about that because I don't know anything about it. I mean, you say we did that.
I don't know anything about it.



You don't know about the reorganization that happened at the national --



**President Donald Trump**:

This administration, perhaps they did that.
Let people go. It used to be with a different newspaper than you are now, you know things like this happen.



But this --



**President Donald Trump**:

We're doing a great job.
Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great, incredible doctor sand businesspeople, the best in the world, and I can say that, whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say, these are the best in the world.
We're doing a great job.
We are 40 people right now, 40, compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount.
and one of the reasons we have40 and others have -- and again that number's going up, gossans, and the number of cases which are very small relatively speaking is going up, but we'vedone a great job because we acted quickly, we acted early.
and there's nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders tohighly-infected areas.
Please go ahead.



Thank you, Mr. President.
NT 24 for Latin americacountries and also for Spain.
I would like to ask you two very brief questions.
One, for how long we going to have the emergency, I mean the national emergency?



**President Donald Trump**:

Hope not long but it's there no wand it gives tremendous powers for things that we need, tremendous power, actually.
and Stafford act and various other things we're involved with have studied and memorized so many different ways and forms, it gives us the kind of power we need to get rid of this virus and we're going to do it very quickly and I hope we won't need it very long, but whatever ittakes.



So for now we still don'tknow for how long, and something very important I wanted to ask you is like how do you think --do you really think it'sessential, coordinating with other countries, and learning from their lessons that they already suffer these same situation countries, of course like china and south Korea, but now recently Italy and Spain.
How is that coordination done? thank you very much.



**President Donald Trump**:

We're in touch with Italy.
It's a country that we love.
We have tremendous -- million sand millions of people originally origins from Italy, and we're working with them.
They are in a very -- they're in probably relatively speaking the toughest position of all.
We're in touch with everybody.
We're in touch with, when I sayeverybody, we're in touch with many of the countries that you know about, that you're writingabout, and they're calling us, asking for advice.
They're asking for the advice of the people behind me. Italy's got a tough situation, but they have really clampeddown.
I think they're going to see some very good results.
It's tough, what they did, they really took their medicine, butthey're going to see some much better results.
Jeff?



Thank you, sir.
With regard to domestic travel, should Americans feel safe or should Americans at all be travelling to states such aswashington state, new York, and other hot spots within thiscountry? and a follow-up on brazil, you're asking people who comeback from europe, americanscoming back from europe, toself-quarantine for a coupleweeks.
You were in a picture withsomebody who now has coronavirusfrom brazil at mar-a-lago.
How is that different?



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, I tell you, first of all, I'm not coming back fromsomeplace.



But you were exposed.



**President Donald Trump**:

There were somebody that they say has it, I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds.
I don't know the gentleman thatwe're talking about, have no idea who he is. I haven't seen the picture.
There's a picture of somebody, but I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day and that night Iowas taking hundreds of pictures.
So I just don't know.
Now, I did sit with the president for probably twohours, but he's tested negative so that's good.



It's just a matter of -- and the domestic --



**President Donald Trump**:

Goahead, please.
I would say if you stay home, it's not bad.
It's not bad.
There are certain parts of the country that are essentially have no -- zero problem.
Washington's been very tough, in particular nursing homes, butwashington, the state ofwashington has been very tough.
It's been a big percentage of when you talk about the 40deaths, it's been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well.
and they all came from a very --a certain area, unfortunately.
Please, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Okay.



Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Sky news.
You talked this week about the United Kingdom doing a good job in tackling coronavirus.
In light of the rising cases, are you changing your mind aboutthat? you also just spoke about possible travel restrictions.
Have you discussed when they might be put in place?



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, in light of the results, as we discussed before, in light of the results, we're going to be looking at it and I know the task force is looking at it verystrongly.
Vice-president, everybody.
It was looking good, but theresults have been building uppretty rapidly so we'll betaking another look at that, yes, absolutely.
Go ahead, please.



Mr. President, thank you.
I want to first follow up onjeff's question because the person you were standing nextto, whether you know who he is or not, tested positive forcoronavirus.
Dr. Fauci said this morning, if you stand next to somebody who tested positive, you shouldself-isolate and get a test.
You say your white house doctoris telling you somethingdifferent.
Who should americans listen to? and My second question --



**President Donald Trump**:

Think they have to listen to their doctors, and I think theyshouldn't be jumping to get the test unless it's necessary.
But I think they have to listen to their doctors.
I don't know -- I haven't seen the picture, somebody saidthere's a picture with somebody talking a picture with me but ihaven't seen it.



Doctors have said you might have it even though you don'thave symptoms.
Are you being selfish by not getting tested --



**President Donald Trump**:

Ididn't say I wasn't going to betested.



Are you going to be?



**President Donald Trump**:

Most likely, yeah, not for thatreason, but I think I will do itanyway.



Will you let us know theresults?



**President Donald Trump**:

We're working out a schedule.
Go ahead, please.



I have a follow-up.



**President Donald Trump**:

Goahead.



I know there's been a lot of talk about testing, I just want to make sure we're clear, though, because we've been hearing from doctors who say as of today, they still can't get patients tested who need a test.
So as of today, can everyone whoa doctor wants to have tested get tested and if not, when?



**President Donald Trump**:

That's been true for a while buti'll let mike.
Why don't you answer that, mike.



Well, as the president said, and Dr. Fauci has articulated, the nature of our current system where the CDC has samples sent and tests are performed or state labs perform tests, in some cases university and hospital labs perform tests, it'sgenerally adequate for an infectious disease or for people getting it diagnostic work done, but given the sheer scale ofthis, the president tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and privatepartnership.
Today, by some estimates, when you add all the labs together, and today, the president made it possible for every state in thecountry, and they're state labs, to authorize labs across their state to do coronavirus testing.
We're estimating somewhere between 15 and 20, 000 tests Ada are able to be performed.
But very soon, with the program that was announced today, Americans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to the mas described on the website, ifthey're symptomatic, if the questionnaire indicates it, be able to have a test there, and these incredible companies will process the test and they'llreceive that information.
But for now, the best advice that we can give for people is to speak to their doctor as the president just said.
and if the doctor indicates thatphysician, if it's not university hospital or otherwise authorized lab can contact the state lab, and again, every state lab in the country can perform tests today but what the president charged us with, when was tasked to take over the white house coronavirus taskforce, was open up tests all across the country.
The president said a few day sago that we made it clear that any American that wanted to get test would be able to clinically to get a test.
Because I literally heard from the governor of Washington state who said the doctors inwashington state were saying that if you're only mildlysymptomatic, they would not order a test.
and fortunately, the president directed CDC to clarify that.
Now, anyone in consultation with their physician regardless of their symptoms can request atest.
and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their at a time, but very soonamericans will be able to go to these drive-in sites and be ableto obtain and participate in atest.
Dr. Birx, is there more toamplify that?



No, I think that's perfectlysaid.
Just to review one more time about the testing.
With lab core and quest, I think many of you have been todoctor's office and seen the little boxes outside.
What they do is deliver both the specimen collection piece, because remember it's a nasalswab, it's not a tube of blood, so they have delivered that todoctor's offices and hospital sand then they will arrange to pick that up. The important piece in this Allies they have gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput to the potential to have automated extraction, I know you don't want details, it's an automated extraction of the rnathat then runs in an automated way on the machine with no one touching it and the result comes out at the other end.
Sample to machine to results.
That cuts out a lot of the manual pieces that were happening delaying the testresults.



With that, what's the timeline like from when you'retested to when you get results, next week what should peopleexpect?



With prior testing it was taking several days because the test is slower.
We believe, with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start, remember it has to transport, to the laboratory, that will runit, and then we're hoping that all can be finished within 24hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receivetoday.
These are not point of caretests.
We are working on point of caretests, but we have to realize point of care tests take six months or more to develop.
So we're not waiting for those, we're still diagnosing this onnuecleic acid.
Nucleic acid.



**President Donald Trump**:

Gavin new com, newcombfcalifornia, we worked on a lot of things having to do withthis, and really the relationship that we have, ican't think of a badrelationship.
We're helping them.
We're funding them in some cases depending what it is you'retalking about and we're all working together very closely sowe've done really I think tremendous job of teamwork with the different states.
One or two more and if you have questions for these folks --does anybody have a question for the folks up here? who has a question up here? you have, okay, go ahead, if you have a question, go ahead.



Thank you.
Pvt I have one for you as well.



**President Donald Trump**:

Thought so. I knew you would.
I was waiting for that.
Go ahead.



I haven't --



**President Donald Trump**:

Ask them first, please.



Yes, I will.
With regards to the ceos, can you please tell us when you expect to see items like handsanitizer, that have been going out of stock very quickly, back on the shelves? there have been a lot of reports about that.
and for you, Mr. President, could you talk about a potentialbail-out for the cruiseindustry? you had suggested that couldhappen.
is that sentencing you're stilllooking at and how much wouldthat be?



**President Donald Trump**:

Ididn't suggest that it couldhappen, but I can tell you it'san industry that was very badly impacted by what's going on with the virus.
and it's a great industry, it'sa very important industry.
and we will be helping them, and we will be helping the airlineindustry, if we have to. Assuming we have to. So far people haven't been asking but if they should beasking, we want to make sure our airlines are very strong and then one day and one day all of sudden wasn't looking so good.
Interestingly, I was talking todoug, and the numbers they'redoing from the retailingstandpoint, I guess because ofthis, it's like the opposite, all of you, you've been selling lot of stuff.
Do you want to answer the question as to the handsanitizers?



Specifically, the areas wherewe're seeing pressure in the supply chain are surfacecleaners, cleaning supplies, paper goods in particular, hand sanitize certificate going to be very difficult to have a hundred percent on stock for some time.
We're replenishing and shippingit, but as soon as it hits thestores, it's gone.
Retailers are workinghand-in-hand with suppliers tobring that to the market as fastas we can.



What is your advice foramericans seeking those items, what is your advice, they'reselling out online, in stores.



I think this team has given you other examples of what people can do to fight back against this virus, and you should look at the entire list.



Obviously it sounds very simplistic but wash your hands as on as you can.
I know you're not always in apposition to wash your hands but if you don't have the alcoholwipes, try and get them.
If you don't, try as best as possible to do it. Do the best you can.



Just general preparedness.
You know, you want to wash yourhands, you want to keep distance from people, and if you'rearound someone sick, keep away from them.
Basic, basic public health.
These guys are selling a lot of toilet paper.
Tony, do you have some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection againstcoronavirus? they're selling out.
But soap and water.
Hot water, soap, 20 seconds, that's how you do it.



**President Donald Trump**:

Okay, one more, go ahead.
Over here, behind you.
Behind you.



Thank you very much, Mr. President.
You have a great team, ofcourse.



**President Donald Trump**:

That's true, thank you.



My question, Mr. President, are you happy from the chineseresponse, what correctly really told you what really happened those days? and second, Prime Minister modi, or India, have closed borders until April 15th.
If you have spoken with the prime Minister of India.
and if they have needed anyhelp.
and finally, sir, any message for the small businesses? because they are losing some businesses because of this.
Thank you, sir.



**President Donald Trump**:

Well, on small businesses, the small business administration is now stacked with money to helpthem, and we're going to make the money readily available if they need it, small businesses.
We had a great time in India, it was an incredible two days, andhe's a great friend of mine, he's a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly as was I in that stadium, it was an incredible event and I loved being with him, so say hello tohim.
But we talked about everything, we talked about far more than just borders and as far as president xi, likewise, he's Friend of mine.
I believe that we are dealing in good faith, that we just worktop, as you know, as I just said, we just worked an incredibledeal, big deal, one of the biggest deals ever made of anykind, big even by the standards of some of the people here that deal with china.
But I think that they want to get to the bottom of thingsalso.
We're working, our drugcompanies, our pharmaceutical companies are working very closely with china, and withindia, as you know, and with allover the world, and they're allover the world.
These are magnificent companies that are very, veryknowledgeable, and we're very lucky to have them, because think you're going to come upwith, whether it's therapeutic or whether it's just help, helping getting better, and then ultimately a vaccine which takes little bit longer because of the test periods and a couple of other reasons, you're going to have it very quickly, because of the great knowledge, and they'llhave it very quickly.
They made a tremendous amount ofprogress.
Thank you all very much.
We appreciate it. Thank you.
Thank you very much.



That was United States presidentdonald trump as well asvice-president mike pence and anumber of officials as well asbusinessmen and women addressingreporters today.
The president has declared anational state of emergency inthe unite States where thecoronavirus is concerned.
He says that frees up a lot ofmoney, additional money to helpaddress some of the consequencesof the virus' spread.
He also announced some changesto the way testing can be done.
He says, he claims that thatwill expedite the process andallow more people who need to betested to get tested.
However, testing has been a hugeproblem in the United States sofar.
The rate at which those testsare getting done is far slowerthan other countries, forexample, like in south korea.
I want to go through some ofwhat president trump said andthen, of course, bring you up tospeed on what's happening inthis country.
This is an extended edition of"power & politics" and I'm vassykapelos.
I want to bring in aaron blake, senior political reporter withthe washington post as well asthe cbc's own katie simpson.
Hi to both of you.
Thanks for being with us. I know you were listeningthrough all of that.
Aaron, I'm going to start withyou.
First of all, on the declarationof a national emergency.
What exactly does that mean?



Well, basically, it frees up$50 billion of government money to go towards these efforts without having to have congress pass a bill.
It also stream lines some of the procedures as far as testing, as far as getting things cleared before they can be deployed.
You know, this is obviously Avery significant development because it's something thatisn't invoked very often.
The president did invoke national emergency last year for the border wall, to build ab order wall.
That was controversial, ofcourse.
I think this is much less likely to be controversial because there is a bipartisan concern obviously with the spread of thecoronavirus.
The question I think from there is how much that freedom is now used to actually do things that are productive.



Katie, on the subject of sort of money and the idea of testing and all the stuff that the president claims will happennow, he also got a lot of questions about his own exposure to the virus.
Can you tell me a bit about that and then also expand a bit on what he said.
He said that essentially, ithink, he will be getting atest, it hasn't been scheduledyet, but it was sort of surprise answer.



Well, it leads to a number of questions about the message that is coming out of the whitehouse.
and it has been incredibly inconsistent throughout this entire process.
and that relates to testing in the United States.
Whether the president is going to get a test, whether the president should beself-isolating because he mayhave been exposed in someplaces.
Let's start with testing becausethat is the most urgent concernin the United States right here.
As you mention, the United States lags behind a number ofother countries, even lagsbehind Canada right now in thenumber of people that haveactually been tested or thenumber of tests that they areaware of. Private labs don't have reportnumbers so it's really hard togauge a sense of what's going ondown here in the United States.
Dr. Anthony fauci, leadingpublic health expert, at thatnews conference and who's reallybeen seen as a leading voicefrom a public health authoritythroughout this process, yesterday described the testingsystem and the way it sort ofrolled out as a failing.
and donald trump was asked todaywhether he takes responsibilitytore that and he very clearlysaid "no" but there have beenproblem with the testing, testsnot rolled out fast enough, thecdc, the test they developed hadproblems with it and when it didroll out, it was not givingreliable answers so there's aseries of problems afterproblems, bureaucraticregulation so the testingneeding to happen in the United States to get a sense of howwidespread this virus is, ithasn't been happening so attoday's news conference we didhear a number of measures beingtaken by the trumpadministration to try and combatthat.
Announcing that they'repartnering with the privatesector to expand how manyfacilities can do the testing, where people can go and get thetesting, others setting up anonline website so that peoplecan go and do a survey and findout these are the symptoms ihave, fill out a survey, determine whether or not theyneed to go and get a test, andthen the website will -- issupposed to, this is what theysay Thea plan is, supposed todirect them perhaps to adrive-through location to get atest.
They're expanding the number ofdrive-through test locationswhere people can go. To really see if this is anissue.
But then donald trump has saidin the past anyone -- actuallysaid it on March 6th, I cantell you exactly the day, march6th, he tours the centres fordisease control and stands infront of the cameras and saysanyone who wants a test can geta test, he goes on to describethem as beautiful tests.
People heard that informationand went to go and get testedwhen they had symptoms and whenthey went to their doctor orwent to their emergencyfacility, a number of thosepatients who have been speakingvery publicly, I interviewed onethis week, had said, and numberof other news outlets have beeninterviewing these people whoare having these stories whoa saythey heard the president, thetrump administration say, hey, we can get a test, okay, I'm notfeeling well, I should just becautious and go and get a testto make sure I'm not carryingthis, I don't have this, andthen when they went to theirhealth care provider, theycouldn't get that test, that's aconsistent problem down here andso the president today said hechanged his tone, he said wedon't want everybody to go get atest that's necessary or notnecessary and then when he wasasked whether he's going to geta test, I have no symptoms, imight get a test because I mightget a test.



Gown, Aaron, a little bit of mixed messaging, I guess, to put it mildly.
-- again, Aaron.
Can you, from your vantagepoint, tell us some of the, iguess, concerns where theadministration's handling of this is concerning and what the wider potential public health impacts of those concerns are?



Yes, so I think katie'sexactly right to focus on the testing aspect.
This was a big development thisweek.
The health officials have in some cases kind of danced around the idea that this is a failing.
Dr. Fauci on Thursday really drove home that this was in fact failing.
He said this is a failing, let'sjust admit it. The question from there is what is success looking like? they're clearly trying to deploy more tests but we also saw in the president's comments here that he is encouraging people who are not symptomatic to not get tested.
He also said that there would be five million of these tests rolled out in the next monthhere.
But he said that, and I think this was a quote, you know, we're probably not going to need that many.
The common thread here throughout the reservations with the president's handling of this is almost incessant desire to downplay this.
I think he uses in certain ways as a reflection of his ownpresidency, he's certainly worried about the impact it will have on the stock market which has plummeted and now actually recovered quite a bit today.
But, you know, even today, as we're now talking about national health emergency, we saw the president at certain points during this press conference downplay this, suggest that maybe it won't get as bad as health officials who are standing around him indicated that it might and you wonder if this is something that a few people around him are trying to get through to him and perhapscan't get him to sign on to.



a lot to watch for.
I really appreciate both of you being with us this evening.
Thanks to Katie Simpson andaaron Blake.



> meanwhile, I want to update things here in Canada.
Prime Minister Justin trudeausaid this morning that the federal government is considering tightening the border to some internationaltravelers.
Earlier this week, United States president Donald trump'sresponse to the public health threat was to suspend travel from Europe to the United States more than 183 Canadians are confirmed to have coronavirus, but is restricting travel essential to controlling the spread of the virus? today the world health organization announced an international fund that allows institutions and private individuals all over the world to contribute to global responseefforts.
Bruce hall ward is theorganization's assistantdirector-general joining us byskype from geneva.
Hi there.
Thank you very much for makingtime for us. Really appreciate it.



Good evening.



Can I start by asking you just a more general question, sir, about the state of the virus right now.
I note that the 5, 000 mark was hit but also that the pronouncement was made that the epicenter moved away from china.
How do you interpret -- how should we, rather, interpretthat?



Well, what we're seeing is the March of this virus across the planet and as we saw from this first spread out of wuhanand right across china veryquickly, 23 days to infect all of the provinces, it was clear that this was going to continue to move.
So I think what we saw in Asia's now being replicated ineurope and there's no reason we should not see it continue to move unless there's some very, very strong control measures in place to try and contain the virus and take some of the heat out of this outbreak.



Dr. Aylward, when you talk about strong containmentmeasures, what specifically are you referring to?



Well, the bottom line is that you have to test to know all of the suspected cases, population has to know what the disease is, they have to be able to access and tested very, very quickly, and then if they're positive, you have to have an effective way to isolate them and identify their closest contacts and quarantine them.
This virus can only survive inhumans, it has to get one from one to another, so the goal is find it fast, break the transmission chains.
That's how china turned this around and some of the other countries that are doing thesame.



When it comes to testing, what is important? is it the speed of it, is it the number of them available, there's lots of questions here right now that are sort of centres being set up outside of hospital settings so that you can either go directly there, because the waits on telehealthare so long.
What should the ideal testing scenario look like?



There's not an ideal number.
The number is enough to be able to make sure you can test all of your suspected cases rapidly.
There's no point in just testing everybody for this virus because it makes itself manifest in illness in people so you want to have enough tests available for that purpose.
and you want to test peoplefast.
Remember, as long as people are wandering around sick, they'respreading the virus, new transmission chains are starting and more people are going to get sick and more people will die so the goal is to find the virus as quickly as possible, the sickpeople.
That means making sure the population know what the diseaseis, know they can get tested and get a rapid test and act on that test quickly.



I want to ask you about thecanadian context first, something a lot of Canadians are talking about today certainly that the Prime Minister is in isolation for the next twoweeks.
He says, as a precaution, because his wife, of course, has been --



Quarantined, I'm sorry, yes.



I think they use the wordinterchangeably.
Yes, quarantine.



They're not interchangeable.



Well, I've heard both fromthis.
Tell me what the difference isthen.



Isolate your cases, I'm sorry to jump in, Vassy, you isolate your cases so that they won'tcome in contact with anyoneelse, won't spread the virus.
Because they're infected and you know they have the virus.
With your contacts, you quarantine those because they'reunder observation to see if they actually have the virus because what we saw in china was 5 to10% of these close contacts actually developed cases so you want to keep a close eye on them but that's a different phenomena than isolating, treating, managing cases.



Gotcha.
In the Prime Minister's casethen, he says that he's not getting a test on the advice of medical professionals becausehe's not showing symptoms.
Can you explain a bit about the symptomatic portion of this? I think a number of people areconfused, can I have it if I'mnot showing symptoms, can transmit it if I'm showingsymptoms, that kind of thing.



Yeah.
It sounds like the Prime Minister could explain it just as well as I can.
Because he's right.
What happens with the disease like this is you get infected and then you have what's called an incubation period, that's the period in which the virus let'ssay taking hold in your body and then you become infectious.
Now in this disease, you become infectious meaning you can pas sit on to somebody else, a very short time before you actually develop symptoms.
It may be the same day you develop symptoms, the day beforemaybe, but not much before.
and then while you're sick with the disease, you can also you'llbe shedding the virus and you'restill infectious, other people can get it from you.
So the trick is to find people as quickly as possible once they become sick and then try to get them isolated as we talkedabout.
and in the case of the Prime Minister, what he was explaining was I may or may not be incubating the virus but at thispoint, we don't know and if you do a test, it will probably be negative and give me a false sense of security so only if is tart to develop symptoms but even because however the Prime Minister recognizes he could beinfectious, even before he develops symptoms, because ofthat, he's playing it safe andhe's in quarantine and being Good citizen frankly.



I have less than a minuteleft, Dr. Aylward.
I'm wondering where containment measures are concerned, some extra restrictive measures were announced today here, particularly where international travelers are concerned.
What is your advice where travel is concerned and where the border is as well?



Well, at W.H.O., we don'trecommend any restrictions ontrade and travel because, asyou've seen in Canada, the virusgets into the country anyway.
The key thing is being able tofind it very, very quickly.
Contain the cases like we talkedabout or isolate them and thenquarantine the contacts.
So generally, frankly, thetravel restrictions don't work, they become a big distraction, they cause all sorts of otherproblems.



Okay.
I'm going to leave it there.
Thank you, Dr. Aylward, I really appreciate you making some time for us this afternoon.



You're welcome.
