Capital.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Glad you're joining us on the CBC news app and CBC news.
We are standing by for the Prime Minister's daily update on the federal response to the pandemic.
Justin Trudeau will be speaking just a day after his government unveiled billions more dollars for businesses to try to keep Canadians working.
We could be hearing more details about this rescue package today as Ottawa rushes to not only protect Canadians' health, but the Canadian economy during this unprecedented shutdown.
That of course is the door, the Prime Minister's front door where we're expecting him to come out in 15 minutes' time.
a couple of messages to tell you about this morning.
I'll bring in My colleague, Vassy kapelos, who is joining me on Saturday, pretty sure it's Saturday, Vassy -- oh, a little problem.
There we go. So there is a cruise ship.
I wanted to give this update.
There is a cruise ship that is stranded, Holland America cruise ship off the coast of panama, that is not allowed to dock.
We've had a little update from the Minister of foreign affairs who says that he has been in contact now with his counterpart in panama, that medical supplies are making their way onto the ship.
This is important because there are about 248 Canadians stuck on the ship and four passengers have now died.
It's a strange situation.
They're not allowed to dock.
They're stuck on the cruise ship.
We know cruise ships have become real problems obviously for the virus and trying to contain a virus on board a cruise ship, but that's the latest update from the Minister on that cruiseship.
There are new repatriation flights that have been scheduled.
Haiti, Honduras and Ecuador.
and Peru at least two more flights starting mid next week.
Just wanted to give people -- because I know there are people tuning in around the world who are waiting for information on things that the government is doing to get them back.
Let me bring in Vassy.
I think we're mostly expecting to hear the Prime Minister really try and reinforce, first of all, the message, hey, yeah, it's the weekend but that doesn't mean you get to go out.
This is the new normal and it's important to remember what public health officials are telling and have been telling us.



**Vassy**:

Exactly.
I think today is on opportunity for the Prime Minister to drive home that message as well as the messages that target the economy that we heard, because we've been watching all week, but there are still a lot of people who are working.
Obviously, not the majority, but leaving their house to work.
So the intention behind this morning's communication My understanding is to reiterate what we've been listening to all week for people who have been artwork during the week.
The main message online the public health -- on the public health front, stay home.
Don't think you can leave your house if you have travelled.
There are new rules in place and laws if you don't comply with the order from the government, if you're returning from abroad and you've crossed into Canada'sborders, to self-isolate for 14 days.
That's a really particular message that you will hear from the Prime Minister today.
We've heard it every single day this week and we can expect to continue hearing it. The other message as you pointedout, is around the economy, two big announcements.
Massive announcements.
The first directed to people whofind themselves out of work or unable to go to work or take home a paycheque because of COVID-19. So a big $107 billion package.
$52 billion directly in aid.
CERB, an emergency benefit that should become available.
In your pocket $2, 000 a month for four months.
a whole host of Canadians qualify.
That message will be reiterated and then the message to those who work for or operate small and medium-sized businesses.
a big change from the initial announcement of a 10% wage subsidy to a 75% wage subsidy.
The details I'm still looking for, we may not get them until Monday, the Prime Minister signalled on Friday, but we'll probably hear questions about them today.
is there a cap on that subsidy? so per employer.
There was one for the 10%, $25, 000 per employer.
is it going to be similar? because that would affect the efficacy of the wage subsidy.
It will last three months, but who exactly qualifies? does it have to be incorporated? those are the questions that business owners have, but there is aid on the way.
and I think that message again will be reiterated by the Prime Minister to sort of drive home what some may have missed over the past few days.



**Rosemary**:

a couple updates on the state of things in this country as far as the pandemic goes.
I will point out that the COVID-19 has now killed more Canadians than SARS did.
SARS back in 2003 killed 44 Canadians.
We're now at 55. Of course, COVID-19, much more easily spread amongst people, so that would be one of the concerns and that is why testing is ramping up. What public health officials continue to say as well as stay home, nearly half of the cases are caused by community spread.
In spite of that, there have been a couple of hopeful notes in Ontario.
We've seen a trend, at least on Friday where the count -- the number of cases is down which is the first dip in daily case growth seen in weeks.
That, to me, indicates that the things that people are doing and the message that officials are sending seem to be working.
At least there are some glimmers that it is. Vassy, I'm going to get you stand by. Vassy kapelos, host of "power and politics". let's go to British Columbia because that's one of the provinces where it does seem there is a tiny bit of positive news.
We're going to take that when we can get it. It's early days.
Health officials warning that physical distancing, though, seems to be warning, seems to be slowing the spread of COVID-19.



I'm starting to see some glimmers of hope, if we will, that we've flattened out, our increase our trajectory has levelled off a bit.
We need to see that continue and ideally we want to see it go down.



**Rosemary**:

That was British Columbia's health officer Bonnie Henry speaking yesterday.
Even though she was hopeful, she did warn that the province isn'tout of the woods just yet.
For more of what is going on in British Columbia, I would imagine what no one wants to do is pull back on the measures that are happening across the country and in British Columbia but tell me how they're reading this and what they're telling people in Vancouver.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, absolutely.
The message from the government, they don't want anybody to become x-rays nlt.
This is -- complacent.
Nobody should stop physical distancing.
In fact, we need to be 100% committed to that.
That's what we heard from the health Minister adrian dix, as well as bonnie henry a second ago.
Yesterday, that briefing was a much anticipated British Columbia briefing.
The epidemiological modelling that health officials have been looking at, looking at data herein British Columbia and comparing it to hubei and northern italy.
From what you heard there, thereis a sign of hope.
Based on the data so far it looks like there does seem to besigns of showing there is a bit of a flattening of the curve, orfalling off of the curve as Dr. Bonnie henry says.
So some of the physical distancing measures we implemented about two weeks ago, they seem to show signs they're working.
She can't say that definitively, but they may be working.
So some of the data she's looking at. So if we had not implemented those measures, we should be expecting a 24% increase in daily new cases and what we're seeing right now is about 12%. so the exact number she gave was215 cases per million people compared to 130 cases per million people.
Those rates both lower than hubei, lower than northern italy, but they could change of course if we have a sudden outbreak at a care home or remote community where there arefewer resources.
Part of the briefing --



**Rosemary**:

You go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Okay.
I was also going to talk about hospital beds and ventilators because that was the big piece of the briefing.
Are we prepared? and health officials say we're reasonably prepared.
Part of the preparation was met by being able to cancel non-essential surgeries, that freed up 3900 hospital beds.
Even if we reach hubei levels ofthe outbreak, we should have enough hospital beds.
On the ventilator front, even ifwe reached northern italy levels, we should have enough ventilators for everybody.
There are 1200 in British Columbia, more on order, but of course everyone istrying to buy more ventilators at this point.
We're reasonably prepared.
The most equipped areas, the lower mainland, so obviously here in vancouver and also if you head out towards the north, that is where you're going to see the fewest equipment.
and they're also expecting higher levels of hospitalizationif you head into the interior where there is higher populationand older demographic.



**Rosemary**:

We'll take those little bits of hope where we can get them.
Part of this is about what we'recalling physical distancing.
Really staying away from getting close to people and making sure those rules are followed.
In London, Ontario, they have set up a tip-line for residents to call in if they spot people breaking protocol.
The acting mayor, ed holder is self-isolating after a trip to the United States, good to see you there, jessie.
What is the idea behind the tip-line.



and why do you want people to use it?



Well, it's really important we're following the advice of public health officials and certainly we've seen people responding overall very well.
Usually we have a big festivity around st. Patrick's day, but they shut down the party.
We are seeing people concerned.
They're hearing the message from public health officials to keep apart.
and when they're seeing people they think are not following theadvice, they're calling in. Up until recently they were calling 911.
We want to discourage that.
We want them to call the appropriate people.
We set up a phone number and e-mail address to let them do that and it seems to be working so far.



**Rosemary**:

What happens? you see people walking on the street? what is the follow-up and the consequence?



So the first part is really to divert the calls away from 911 because in addition to what is happening with COVID-19, we have other things happening in the communities, we want to keep the lines clear.
So this way we can identify if there is an issue, for example, in a particular playground where we have people constantly trying to use the equipment even thoughit's closed.
We can increase signage, send a staff people out there and I think education is the first message.
We want to make sure people understand about the physical distancing to reinforce that messaging and that's what's happening so far.



**Rosemary**:

So it's more about keeping people aware?



Absolutely.
We don't need vigilantism as well, we are trying to reinforce the message.
We've seen dozens of phone calls come in and hundreds of e-mails.
and a lot of it is connecting them to the appropriate information.
If we can reinforce it on it those sites, we're taking those measures now.



**Rosemary**:

Because I know the mayor, ed holder a little bit, he's just self-isolating as a precaution?



He is. He was abroad in the United States when all this happened.
So he came home as soon as he could.
He has been isolating and will be coming out, I think, on Tuesday.
So ed is doing well and thank you for asking.



**Rosemary**:

I wish you all well.
Stay healthy and good luck keeping everybody doing the right thing.
I appreciate it very much.
Jesse hell mere, acting mayor.
I'll bring back in Vassy kapelos.
There is encouraging news.
I think one of the -- I said again because it's the weekend, because people see little signs that the flattening of the curve is working, that the physical distancing is working, the worst thing to do right now would be to take your foot off the gas, if you will, and think you can change your behavior.
It does not.
In quÉbec yesterday we saw 10 deaths in one day.
In part because spring break there happened a little bit ahead of time compared to other parts of the country.
So I imagine we'll hear more of that from the Prime Minister.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I imagine, too.
and I think that's a really good point to underline and one we continue to hear from public health officials in pretty much every province.
Even though we have that glimmer of hope through the modelling, it's modelling based on physical distancing that is taking place right now, measures that are in place right now.
If you were to take your foot off the brake and take that as assign to relax, that would change the forecast, that would change the modelling and thus become not as successful or able to prevent the increase in cases or the higher increase -- the bigger jump in cases.
So I think, and we have heard this continually from those public health officials, there is a lag, right? there is a time where you're doing this stuff and physical distancing and your stores are closed and about 10 days to two weeks after you've had that in place for a little bit, you might start to see some encouraging things on the curve.
That doesn't mean there aren't new cases.
That doesn't mean that you can stop what you're doing, but there is that sort of slide down, that proves what we're doing is making a difference.
I think that is why we keep hearing all the questions toward public health officials about timeline.
Everybody sitting at home is wondering how long do we have to live this way? it's too hard.
They're not able to know at this point what the exact number of days is, but we are starting to see signs what we're doing is beginning to work and that message will be reiterated.



**Rosemary**:

Here he is now.
The Prime Minister of Canada on this Saturday with his briefing.
