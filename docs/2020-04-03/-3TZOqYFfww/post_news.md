All right.
That is our daily federal briefing from today.
The chief medical officer of health, Dr. Theresa tam, and herdeputy, Dr. Njoo.
No cabinet ministers there today, not because they're not working, but they weren't part of the briefing today.
I will tell you as the briefing happened, some new data was posted on the public health agency of Canada's website and you heard Dr. Tam talking about it a little bit.
I'll bring in the host of "power& politics," Vassy kapelos.
I know she was looking at it as well.
One of the statistics Dr. Tam gave right off the top and hit home for me and is worth repeating for other people, while the number of tests have gone up, the hospitalization of Canadians that have been hit by COVID-19 is about 7%, but Dr. Tam made it very clear that of that group of hospitalizations, 30% of those people are under 40. I hammer home that point because know there is some misconception that it is primarily vulnerable or older people that get easily infected.
and while they end up in the most dire situations, we are seeing a lot of people under 40 hospitalized, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, a lot of people under 40 hospitalized, and another piece of data that came out amongst the big chunk of it that Dr. Tam was referring to is the people that are getting this and testing positive for this are in the age groups of -- I want to pull up the exact, the younger age groups.
I was looking at that data.
The highest number of cases 40 to 59, then 20 to 39. Then 60 to 79. However, the last group of people represents 56% of hospitalizations.
However, again, you're absolutely right.
She was trying to underscore themessage, and Dr. Tam said this herself, the seriousness of the disease.
The idea that a lot of us have that just because we're not 65 or over, this won't affect us Ina serious way, the data is not bearing out.
30% of those hospitalizations are under the age of 40. 7% of the cases so far in this country have resulted in hospitalization.
3% of those cases are in critical care.
1% have passed away.
So we're looking at a mortality rate at this juncture, and I keep on qualifying it because the data moves quickly obviously, so it's important to know this is a snapshot in time, but at this time a mortality rate of 1%. some interesting data throughout.
and another thing I would throw out there that is important to understand is the community transmission versus travel-basedtransmission.
We know this began with people who had travellered, but we are seeing a shift.
About 60% are from community transmission and 40% from traveland in a lot of cases it's a 50-50 split.
This is why the messages that we've heard from public health officials like tam is of the utmost important as we speak.
The travel stuff is super important, but so is staying inside, only going to the grocery store once a week if youcan, all of the stuff we keep hearing about physical distancing, that is what will slow the rate of community transmission and that is where this virus is spreading right now.



**Rosemary**:

As we saw travel being limited more and more and more, it is predictable that it would move to community transmission.
That is the primary concern for everybody and that's why the Prime Minister announced this move as of Monday at noon, if you present any symptoms of COVID-19 if you're trying to board a domestic flight or rail travel, you will be not permitted to get on. How will we know, on international flights, we know some people are not truthful about their symptoms and this ishonour-based.



**Vassy**:

We got a few more details, but very few from the health officials.
No details provided on enforcement by the Prime Minister.
The onus will be on the operator, the airline operator or the train operator to ask questions.
If they see any physical signs of it, they can deny you boarding and you will not be permitted to board until you can provide a medical certificate saying that it was not COVID-19. Not a lot of details about what the airlines or rail companies will do. But how it will be enforced -- it's already a difficult time for these operators with layoffs, so we await those details.
As I mentioned, they weren't provided yet in either of the briefings we received.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, Vassy, for your help with the coverage and for being here on a weekend, although no one knows what a weekend is. That was the Prime Minister and the health officials briefing.
We will be back tomorrow around the same time.
There will be more updates on the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the day.
Stay tuned to CBC news network and CBC.
Ca.
