### Summary:

 We need to continue to do what is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which means continuing social distancing, continuing to not go out unless you absolutely have to, continuing to think about caring for each other, thinking about protecting each other and thinking about protecting our health care workers and those essential workers who are doing such extraordinary service to keep things going, to keep us safe at the same time.
People have been following that, but I can enhance that we have formalized some of the domestic travel rules.
Our young people specifically, we've been counting on them over the past years to continue to step up in the fight against climate change, in the fight against poverty and supporting abetter world internationally and at home.
and we continue to need young people to be that vehicle for building a better future and sharing messages.
Obviously, young people, like every generation, are chafing at the bit in terms of having to beself-isolated, particularly at atime when we tell our young people, at an age we say now is the time to go out and discover the world, whether it's with a backpack or in a laboratory, make new discoveries, challenge yourselves, challenge the world and they're looking at their plans for the spring and their summer jobs and they're realizing that there is a massive anxiety and massive uncertainty out there.
On the contrary, this generationof young people is so committed and engaged to creating a betterworld that we need you to keep leading the way you are.




Yes, young people who will many of them qualify for the CERB and be helped through the payroll subsidy -- the wage subsidy we're creating for businesses and bringing up to 75%.
Increasing the wage subsidy to 75% means businesses across the country are now realizing they're going to be able to keep people on their payroll, keep that relationship going between them and their workers and even rehire people they didn't think they'd be able to support in the past two weeks.
We know that what we do now to hold things together, to give people the ability to stay home, to isolate, to hold through this difficult time, is key to how we will come back stronger afterwards. 



The Canada emergency response benefit will give people $2, 000 every month for the next four months to help get us through this time.
We need to be able to get through this so we can help rebuild a world in which people can prosper and everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed. At the same time, we recognize that there are some people who need to travel in order to deliver essential goods and deliver food and we would not like to take steps that we absolutely do not need to take right now.



Obviously people across the country have been doing an excellent job of staying home, of not travelling for anything that is not absolutely necessary and we encourage people to continue to do that.



Well, the quarantine act says that people have to self-isolate if they're coming back from travelling and that isextremely important.
We need people who might have been exposed overseas or in other countries to not transmit COVID-19 to the rest of the population which is trying to protect itself.







We recognize and have told people that have symptoms they need to self-isolate, they need to stay home.







Obviously, we're very concerned with opec's decisions that are putting at risk the livelihood of people around the world, particularly Canadians who work in the oil and gas sector.
We are focused on helping those Canadians, helping people who are hardest hit by economically by COVID-19.
But we also know it's a sector that has been particularly hard-hit and we will look for further help to be able to support people as they get through.
It will be a transport Canada rule that will be enforced, but at the same time, we're telling people stay home if it's not absolutely essential for you to travel.
That's why we've made the commitment to help people who need help getting through this time.
and we continue to work every day to look at ways that we can help, look at how we can help, look at what we can do to help.



We're continuing to work to try to provide workers in the energy sector with the support they need.
We recognize that the oil -- oil prices around the world is hitting people hard who have been hard hit over the past years already.
We're working with provinces, we're working with industry, we're working with various sectors, including unions and others, to try to make sure that on top of the help we're alreadygiving, $2, 000 a month to people laid off, 75% wage subsidy, so companies can keep people on thepayroll, we're going to continue to make sure that once we are through this difficult time, people in industries and places across the country are going to be able to pick themselves up and get back to work and have our economy continue to work strongly like it was before.
It's going to take a lot of effort in the meantime and it's going to take us doing different things and trying different things, but we're going to keep working until we manage to help everyone.



People need to know that the decline in the rate of transmission happened because two weeks ago people started heeding these instructions and started self-isolating, started engaging in social distancing and over the intervening weeks, people have increased their following of advice and that is an excellent sign, but if we're seeing a -- seeing a reduction in the spikes, that means what we're doing is working and we, therefore, need to continue doing what we're doing.
Obviously, if the measures we'redoing are working, we need to continue doing them and that is why as a government we're makingsure that people are able to continue doing what they're doing by flowing money to households, by supporting businesses with a 75% wage subsidy, by making access to credit that much easier.
That is why we moved to close Canada services offices so people can access these greater resources online because people will be there to work and respond to them virtually and online while creating opportunities to actually support people who do need that extra help, but, of course, there are people who have to continue to go out and work.
We think of grocery store workers, emergency responders, those are people putting themselves at greater risk everyday to provide essential services to Canadians.
Yes, there are things that businesses and governments are doing in order to keep frontlineworkers as safe as possible, but every single Canadian has things we can do that will reduce the risk for grocery store cashiers, or delivery people, who are continuing to get food to our doors.
These are the things that we all need to be responsible for because people out there doing essential services for us need to be protected. At the federal level we're limited in our tools, much of protections for renters and relationship between renters and landlords are provincial areas of jurisdiction, but we're, of course, continuing to work with the provinces on ways we can do that.
Access to credit through banks will be helpful as well as we recognize people are using their credit cards for more and more things and those balances are piling up and they're concerned about things.
At the same time, we can point not just to the Canada emergency response benefit, but things like the Canada housing benefit which will be coming out in Ontario in the month of April, will help vulnerable people be able to pay their rents.
I recognize the anxiety with the beginning of the month coming and we're looking at ways that we can help people get through that.
We continue to follow the direct advice of health professionals on what next steps are, but like said, we've asked people to stay at home and work from home as much as possible, not go out if they don't have to, and that certainly is something that we're doing and encouraging everyone to do.
