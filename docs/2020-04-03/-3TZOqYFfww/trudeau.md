**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Usually a time where we get to get together with friends, spend time with the kids, family.
Obviously, this is another different Saturday as we've had over the past few weeks.
We need you to continue to stay home.
We need you to continue to do everything we can to flatten thecurve.
Obviously, there are sacrifices we're all making, but it's beginning to work.
We see promising news out of British Columbia that over the past couple of weeks the measures taken in place by so many Canadians, the choices that Canadians have made, have had an impact on the overall numbers, but we need to keep it up. We need to continue to do what is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which means continuing social distancing, continuing to not go out unless you absolutely have to, continuing to think about caring for each other, thinking about protecting each other and thinking about protecting our health care workers and those essential workers who are doing such extraordinary service to keep things going, to keep us safe at the same time.




**Translator**:

This is the responsibility that we all have to stay home and to do everything we can to prevent any extension of this pandemic or it hurting other people.
Here on this beautiful Saturday, we should all be staying home in isolation and not be taking any steps that might put in danger our health care workers or our loved ones.
But as you know, we have been encouraging people to stay home, particularly if they have symptoms of COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Particularly, if you feel the onset of symptoms, a cold, COVID-19, you need to stayhome.
You need to isolate.
You need to not travel.
People have been following that, but I can enhance that we have formalized some of the domestic travel rules.
As of Monday at noon, people showing any signs whatsoever of COVID-19 will be denied boarding on all domestic flights and intercity passenger trains.




**Translator**:

Today I'm announcing that transport canadahas introduced new rules for travel.
Obviously we've been saying for a long time that if you have any symptoms of COVID-19, you must not travel, you must stay home.
But starting now, or rather starting on Monday at noon, if people try to travel by plane or through domestic means or by train, they will not be allowed to board if they have any symptoms whatsoever of COVID-19. We must continue to keep a safe distance from each other.
We must continue to protect ourselves and we must continue to make the responsible decisions.
Again, I want to thank the millions and millions of Canadians who are doing precisely that.
It's extremely important so that we can all stay safe and so that we can ensure that when this crisis is over, we can go back to a normal life and continue to have a prosperous and healthy country.
But it requires that everyone do their share now.
and in the coming days and weeks.
Last night, I had an opportunity to do something that I love to do. I was able to spend some time with members of My new council and for me spending time with offshore youth council, and for me spending time with them, it'sgreat, gives me energy and helps me to realize how much young people are involved.
I was with the Minister charger and two parliamentary secretaries and we had an open discussion with young people from the council right across the country.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

The conversation I was able to have on the Prime Minister youth council last night were extraordinary.
Obviously, lots of questions and comments around COVID-19 and vulnerable populations from the north to internet access and broadband access for rural communities.
Questions about what young people can do. Questions around what they can tell their friends who are doing well or not doing well.
Talks, conversations about mental health as well, because obviously this is a moment of anxiety and stress for so many people.
This was a great conversation, like so many of the great conversations being had amongst Canadians across the country.
Our young people specifically, we've been counting on them over the past years to continue to step up in the fight against climate change, in the fight against poverty and supporting abetter world internationally and at home.
and we continue to need young people to be that vehicle for building a better future and sharing messages.
Obviously, young people, like every generation, are chafing at the bit in terms of having to beself-isolated, particularly at atime when we tell our young people, at an age we say now is the time to go out and discover the world, whether it's with a backpack or in a laboratory, make new discoveries, challenge yourselves, challenge the world and they're looking at their plans for the spring and their summer jobs and they're realizing that there is a massive anxiety and massive uncertainty out there.
But that doesn't mean we're powerless.
Doesn't mean they're powerless.
On the contrary, this generationof young people is so committed and engaged to creating a betterworld that we need you to keep leading the way you are.
We need you to share your messages with friends.
We need you to lead by example.
We need you to be challenging and discovering the world in virtual ways.
There are ways that you can continue to shape the future we all live in every single day, not just with your choices, but with your leadership and that's what we need.




**Translator**:

We need our young people to continue to challenge the world, to continue to push people to do what is responsible and to want to be the leaders that we need.
and during these times of crisis, we need that even more.
So I'm counting on you and I know that the present and the future are in very good hands with our young people.
We are going to be there for you.
As young people, we know there are many out there who may not feel qualified for the emergencybenefit, others will be supported through their businesses if they work part-time as a result of the assistance we're providing.
But we will continue to find other ways to ensure that you remain confident, not only about the future, but the present and the future as well.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Yes, young people who will many of them qualify for the CERB and be helped through the payroll subsidy -- the wage subsidy we're creating for businesses and bringing up to 75%. but there is always going to be more to do. We're going to keep listening and ensuring that Canadians get through this in the best possible way, by supporting them now and ensuring we can war back stronger once this is all done.
That's why we put forward big measures to help businesses over the past few days.
Increasing the wage subsidy to 75% means businesses across the country are now realizing they're going to be able to keep people on their payroll, keep that relationship going between them and their workers and even rehire people they didn't think they'd be able to support in the past two weeks.
We know that what we do now to hold things together, to give people the ability to stay home, to isolate, to hold through this difficult time, is key to how we will come back stronger afterwards.
But we need to stick together and we need to do it. 



**Translator**:

We need to look at everything we can do, every one of us, to come through these difficult times.
and that's why we provided assistance to small and medium sizes businesses.
We're also facilitating access to credit.
Cash flow will be very important for people these days in order to borrow money for example if they need, and we've made loans of $40, 000 available interest-free for the first year, and you will not have to pay $10, 000 of that if certain conditions are met.
So we will be working together to ensure that we have the ability to come through this.
Our plan of $107 billion was passed by parliament and we are going to be starting to deliver that aid to Canadians.
and Canadians are anxious to receive it. But we're working as fast as we can, as hard as we can to deliver that to Canadians as soon as possible.
This is an unprecedented situation, but that's exactly what we're going to do together.
The Canada emergency response benefit will provide $2, 000 every month for the next four months to Canadians and I'm inviting you now to apply on Canada revenue agency so you canapply as soon as the portal is open in the next few days.
If you can, register as well with direct deposit so the moneyis put directly into your bank account.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

The Canada emergency response benefit will give people $2, 000 every month for the next four months to help get us through this time.
I know a lot of people have showed interest in it already.
My recommendation to you is to go on the Canada revenue agency site and sign up in advance through the My account links.
Once you do that, in the coming days when we're able to start actually opening applications, you'll have a head start and if you can opt for the direct deposit option which will let you get this money into your bank accounts sooner and is simpler for everyone as well.
There are lots of things that we're doing to make sure that we get through this together, but everything we do we need to do together.
Every single individual, every single household has its role to play in making sure that Canada and Canadians do well through this.
We also have a role to play in making sure that the world gets through this, both by modelling solutions and demonstrating what can be done when we all work together.
This is going to be key, particularly as parts of the world that are much more vulnerable are beginning to get harder hit.
We need to be able to get through this so we can help rebuild a world in which people can prosper and everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed.
I know Canadians are up to this challenge.
I know we're going to do this together.




**Translator**:

I have a great deal of confidence in Canadians and our ability to come through this because we do what we always have to do in these difficult times, we're there for each other.
Thank you, and have a great Saturday.



**Reporter**:





**Reporter**:

Thank you.
good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
First of all, I'd like to hear about the new rules that will becoming into effect by transport Canada.
Has this prompted you to reflecton tightening up the interprovincial borders or maybeyou're not at that stage yet?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We do recognize there are a great many Canadians who are already self-isolating.
They have changed their behavior.
They're no longer travelling andwe're going to have to continue to do that, all of us. At the same time, we recognize that there are some people who need to travel in order to deliver essential goods and deliver food and we would not like to take steps that we absolutely do not need to take right now.
But as I said, we will always look at what is needed and we will take whatever measures are necessary at the right time.
If they become necessary.
But for now, that is not something we're planning to do in the short-term.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Obviously people across the country have been doing an excellent job of staying home, of not travelling for anything that is not absolutely necessary and we encourage people to continue to do that.
However, there is essential transport and travel that is happening, merchandise, food gets delivered across the country.
We need to continue to ensure that is happening.
Every step of the way we're going to look at whether we need to take further measures to keepcanadians safe and to keep our economy rolling on essential goods.
We will make those decisions as they are needed to be made, but right now we're not looking at closing provincial borders.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

There are know birds coming back today and we can see them and the sq has told them to respect the quarantine, but there is a lot of confusion about people coming back and what they're supposed to do. Mr. Trudeau, when they arrive incanada, are they allowed to take walks or ride their bike under the quarantine act? what applies to them?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, the quarantine act says that people have to self-isolate if they're coming back from travelling and that isextremely important.
We need people who might have been exposed overseas or in other countries to not transmit COVID-19 to the rest of the population which is trying to protect itself.
So we're asking everyone to follow the rules and the advice from health Canada.



**Reporter**:

thank you, good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Why -- which buses that travel between the provinces are not included in this new measure?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

Well, transport Canada's measures apply to industries that are within federal responsibility.
Now obviously, there are industries that do not fall within the federal government's purview and we are now putting measures in place so that people do not travel in they have symptoms of COVID-19. Now obviously if people have symptoms, we ask them to stay home but at this point they won't be able to take a plane Ora train.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize and have told people that have symptoms they need to self-isolate, they need to stay home.
They should not travel.
Now there will be transport Canada rules coming into place that will prevent anyone indicating symptoms to travel byairline or by train.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

On another subject, about the United States and Canada Canadian border, we understand that the United States is turning back some people at the border to their native country and I'm wondering what you think of this?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

Well, we're currently in an unprecedented situation in the history of our country and perhaps in the history of the world and our ability to respond in order to protect Canadians and prevent the spread of this virus are by definition exceptional measures.
We will do everything we can to reflect our approach and our values, but we must protect Canadians during this difficult time and that's exactly what we're doing.



**Reporter**:

Premier Kenny said yesterday he'd like to see a coordinated north America response to opec's actions to flood the world with oil.
He suggested ideas like tariffs on Saudi oil and anti-dumping case, do you support these ideasand support the more aggressive approach to opec's actions recently?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Obviously, we're very concerned with opec's decisions that are putting at risk the livelihood of people around the world, particularly Canadians who work in the oil and gas sector.
We are focused on helping those Canadians, helping people who are hardest hit by economically by COVID-19. The measures we've put in place will support Canadians right across the country, including in our oil and gas sector.
But we also know it's a sector that has been particularly hard-hit and we will look for further help to be able to support people as they get through.
In terms of international collaboration, coordination, we continue to be part of conversations on this issue around the world.



**Reporter**:

Would you look at am ore aggressive approach to Saudi Arabia?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I think this is a moment that we need to focus on getting through COVID-19 as best we possibly can.
I think there will be a lot of reflections on how various countries behaved in this particular moment.
Our focus is right now on making sure we support citizens and stabilize the global economy the best way we can which would you remember doing through your membership in the g7, in g20 and international fora and approaches that we have while at the same time focusing that we're supporting Canadians and keeping them safe.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
On the cruise ship anchored off the coast of panama, what actions are taken or considered to be taken to help the Canadians aboard?



We have worked directly and contacted directly the panama government to try to get an ability to bring those canadianshome.
We know this is a very difficult situation for them, for their families.
a lot of people around the world are worried about being able to get home.
a lot of their family members here are feeling anxious and really want to see them brought home.
I can tell you that the entirety of global affairs Canada employees are single mindedly focused on this herculean task of bringing Canadians home any way we can.
and much of it involves negotiating with other countries to get permissions to cruise ships to dock, permissions for airplanes to lift off from a country where they closed the airspaces.
We're going to continue to work diligently to do everything we can to get all Canadians home and provide significant consular support both in the meantime and to those people who are unable to get home.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

Could you be more specific about how these new measures will work for trips by train and plane? who will be enforcing this? will it be the airline companies? because we saw for international flights there are people who did board flights even though they had symptoms.
So how can you be sure this will be properly enforced.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

We expect those rules to be followed.
Yes, it will be the responsibility of the companies to ensure that people who show any symptoms of COVID-19 do not board a train or a plane.
We know that it is essential that people avoid travel that isnon-essential and that any person who has symptoms of COVID-19 be self-isolating and stay home.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

It is extremely important for people to be following the rules.
It will be important for operators of airlines and trains to ensure that people who are exhibiting symptoms do not board those things.
It will be a transport Canada rule that will be enforced, but at the same time, we're telling people stay home if it's not absolutely essential for you to travel.
Stay home absolutely if you're exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19, of a flu-like virus.
We need you to keep yourselves safe.
We need you to keep your loved ones and your neighbours safe.
We need to you keep from overburdening and endangering the safety of our health care workers and others who are doingso much to keep us safe as a country.



Reporter:



**Translator**:

You have provided$500 million for health care needs, but there are provinces having a lot of problems, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, will there be another phase of assistance for those provinces that are in a very precarious situation?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

We're dealing with an unprecedented situation.
We need to be there for each other and the federal government will seek to help any province or any individuals or any businesses that are in trouble because of COVID-19. We continue to look at what we can do every single day and what we must do, how we can do more, and we'll continue to work hand-in-hand with the premiers of the provinces and territoriesand other leaders right across the country to ensure that people have the necessary assistance.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize this is a situation without precedent.
a situation that is beyond our collective and individual experience.
That's why we've made the commitment to help people who need help getting through this time.
Whether it's an individual, a family, a business, or indeed a province.
and we continue to work every day to look at ways that we can help, look at how we can help, look at what we can do to help.
Those conversations will continue to be ongoing for sectors and provinces that are facing particular difficulties.



**Reporter**:

I want to revisit the energy sector question.
Bill morneau said it was hours or days until the energy sector would find out what the government would do. So when are they going to get the answers they need?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're continuing to work to try to provide workers in the energy sector with the support they need.
We recognize that the oil -- oil prices around the world is hitting people hard who have been hard hit over the past years already.
That is why we need to get this right.
We're working with provinces, we're working with industry, we're working with various sectors, including unions and others, to try to make sure that on top of the help we're alreadygiving, $2, 000 a month to people laid off, 75% wage subsidy, so companies can keep people on thepayroll, we're going to continue to make sure that once we are through this difficult time, people in industries and places across the country are going to be able to pick themselves up and get back to work and have our economy continue to work strongly like it was before.
It's going to take a lot of effort in the meantime and it's going to take us doing different things and trying different things, but we're going to keep working until we manage to help everyone.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Ashley Burke, CBC news.
As you mentioned in the top of the speech, you said there are encouraging signs out of britishcolumbia.
Are you worried at all that Canadians will hear the encouraging signs and become complacent?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

People need to know that the decline in the rate of transmission happened because two weeks ago people started heeding these instructions and started self-isolating, started engaging in social distancing and over the intervening weeks, people have increased their following of advice and that is an excellent sign, but if we're seeing a -- seeing a reduction in the spikes, that means what we're doing is working and we, therefore, need to continue doing what we're doing.
We're not out of the woods yet.
Obviously, if the measures we'redoing are working, we need to continue doing them and that is why as a government we're makingsure that people are able to continue doing what they're doing by flowing money to households, by supporting businesses with a 75% wage subsidy, by making access to credit that much easier.
We're going to continue to do more things as we look at ways to help Canadians get through this so we can come out of this strong without a reappearance orresurgence of the virus after.




**Translator**:

If we start to see some positive results in a few places, it is because two weeks ago they started to follow the advice of health Canada, in other words to self-isolate and prevent the virus from spreading.
So that means that the measures we have brought in are working and they must continue to be applied.
People must continue to self-isolate and maintain a safedistance from others so we can really prevent the spread of COVID-19. and we will have to continue forquite a while again if we want to remain safe and see a declinein the number of cases and a flattening of the curve.
and that's why we're giving so much help to families and businesses and communities.
That's why we're making access to credit easier so that we can continue in spite of the currentdifficulties to follow that advice because that will allow us to come out of this faster and in a better situation.



**Reporter**:

Domestic travellers getting on planes and trains an dis it based on the honour system? if so, there are cases of Canadians lying so they can continue to travel.
How do you prevent that?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're asking Canadians and telling Canadians they need to remain home.
They must, as much as possible, avoid non-essential travel.
This is something that is essential if we're going to get through this together.
Obviously, if anyone is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, they should not go out.
They should stay home.
They should not travel.
and we are giving further tools to airlines and rail companies to ensure that anyone exhibitingcovid-19 symptoms does not travel.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

We have been very clear in staying that people have to stay home and avoid non-essential travel.
Of course, particularly so if someone has symptoms of COVID-19, that person should self-isolate and stay home and not be travelling for whatever reason other than going to the hospital.
But there are ways to do that safely.
People should not be taking planes or trains if they exhibitany symptoms of COVID-19. Right now we're providing new tools to our transportation companies so they can ensure that those people do not travel.



**Reporter**:

The government has shut its service Canada offices because it deemed front line workers there doing face-to-facework with the public risky, but we're still asking many Canadians, grocery store workers, bus drivers, to do thissame risky work.
Are we going to do anything to mitigate this?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize as much as possible services need to be shifted online or on to the telephone.
That is why we moved to close Canada services offices so people can access these greater resources online because people will be there to work and respond to them virtually and online while creating opportunities to actually support people who do need that extra help, but, of course, there are people who have to continue to go out and work.
We think of grocery store workers, emergency responders, those are people putting themselves at greater risk everyday to provide essential services to Canadians.
and yes, we need to do everything we can to protect them, but each and every one of us can do things that will protect them as well.
Ensuring that we're only going out for groceries once a week.
Ensuring that we're cutting down on our movements.
That we're not in situations where we're going to have to call on emergency services or essential personnel for any reason other than absolutely essential reasons.
That means staying safe and staying at home.
Yes, there are things that businesses and governments are doing in order to keep frontlineworkers as safe as possible, but every single Canadian has things we can do that will reduce the risk for grocery store cashiers, or delivery people, who are continuing to get food to our doors.
These are the things that we all need to be responsible for because people out there doing essential services for us need to be protected.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

We recognize that not putting people at risk by having online services available is a good way of preventing the risk to people who can work from home and don't have to do it face-to-face.
We also know there are workers who will have to continue to work in our stores, in our grocery stores, that they will have to be there, for example, to respond to emergencies.
So we, with these companies, aretrying to do what we can to makethese employees safer, but I think as citizens and as consumers, we can all do things that will lessen the risk for these individuals whether it is only going to do one's grocery shopping once a week, or not calling on emergency services.
and there are many, many things we can do and must do to protectthe people who are there to helpus, who are providing essential services in this difficult time.
and I invite everyone to reflecton what they can do to allow those people who do that essential work to remain healthy.



**Reporter**:

The first of the month is coming up and many Canadians are going to have to pay their rent, while $2, 000 is a good start, it doesn't roll out until after that and then after, it might not be enough to cover the rent of many people across the country, so what are you hoping will happen? what are you hoping can happen to those who can't make rent considering you have worked with the banks to help people defer mortgages? what about renters?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're looking at different things we can do. At the federal level we're limited in our tools, much of protections for renters and relationship between renters and landlords are provincial areas of jurisdiction, but we're, of course, continuing to work with the provinces on ways we can do that.
Access to credit through banks will be helpful as well as we recognize people are using their credit cards for more and more things and those balances are piling up and they're concerned about things.
At the same time, we can point not just to the Canada emergency response benefit, but things like the Canada housing benefit which will be coming out in Ontario in the month of April, will help vulnerable people be able to pay their rents.
There are many different methodswe're trying and looking at to support Canadians through this difficult time.
I recognize the anxiety with the beginning of the month coming and we're looking at ways that we can help people get through that.



**Reporter**:

Global news, Prime Minister, wanted to ask you for an update on your wife, Sophie, has she been cleared by doctors and how is she doing?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Sophie is feeling great.
My family is doing well, My kid sand myself, we're all doing well.
We continue to follow the direct advice of health professionals on what next steps are, but like said, we've asked people to stay at home and work from home as much as possible, not go out if they don't have to, and that certainly is something that we're doing and encouraging everyone to do.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

Sophie feels much, much better now.
She's in fine form in My opinion.
and the children are well as well.
They're healthy and we're continuing to follow all the advice of experts like everyone should be doing.
and like everyone should also bedoing, we should stay at home and stay isolated as much as possible and not go out unless it's absolutely necessary.
and always follow public health advice.



Reporter:



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking to Canadians on this Saturday.
Something he has taken to do over the past two weeks or so. At the end, asking how his wife Sophie grÉgoire-trudeau is doing, remember she had tested positive for COVID-19 about two weeks ago, and while he didn't directly answer the question whether she's been given the all-clear by doctors, he does say she's feeling great, she's in top shape in My opinion, he said, we're all doing well, but they are remaining inside the house, staying at home.
He is working from home as an attempt, to I guess, practise what he is preaching which was again the message to Canadians.
It might be Saturday, the weekend, but it doesn't mean youcan let up. The government is still calling on people to practise physical distancing and stay home.
Let's bring in the host of "power and politics", Vassy kapelos, who is also joining me here on Saturday.
a little bit of news from the Prime Minister as well.



**Vassy**:

a bit of news that no win in addition to putting further restrictions on international travel, so people travelling from Canada -- sorry outside of Canada into Canada, now there will be restrictions on travel within Canada and namely, if you are showing or displays any symptoms of COVID-19, you will not -- according to the Prime Minister as of noon on Monday -- be allowed to board trains or planes within the country.
So if you're just flying betweentoronto and Ottawa or Toronto and Vancouver, if you are displaying the symptoms, he says you will not be allowed to board the train or the plane.
a couple of things to note on the specific announcement, I know one of our colleagues was asking why doesn't it include buses? it looks like that is provincial jurisdiction and that would be like under various responsibilities where provinces are concerned.
We know there is reduced bus capacity after much of greyhound stopped operating a little whileago.
a question from our colleague Ashley Burke around how this will be enforced.
We know this is a pertinent question.
The quarantine act was applied, meaning it's against the law to not self-isolate when you came back, but how are the measures to be enforced? and the only answer the Prime Minister provided was there willbe further tools for the companies in order to make sure that people without symptoms arenot allowed to board.
I'm not clear, though, on what exactly that means and what happens if you do board and you end up showing symptoms.
I know from a lot of anecdotal evidence, there are issues with the whole process, even when they're boarding international flights.
Some people think others are faking it. There is a whole conversation happening there.
and even though it's within the airlines' purview don't get on, I'm curious how this will work in the domestic context.
Just a reminder, that starts noon on Monday according to the Prime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

When he was asked if inter provincial borders would be shut down, he shut that down, said no. Although we know some provinces are telling people they have to self-isolate when they arrive, particularly the atlantic provinces.
How exactly will this work? it was 10 days ago that Canada ordered all airlines to prevent travellers from getting on planes with symptoms.
and the health check is an honour system.
You have to disclose you have the symptoms unless they're apparent.
and we have done reporting, daveseglins did reporting this week that show that people in a desperate attempt to get home are not being truthful about their symptoms and are getting on the planes anyway.
So I'm not sure what this will do domestically either given they're having trouble enforcingit internationally.
I'm going to get you to stand by. We're waiting for the regular federal update at noon from -- ibelieve we're just going to hearfrom Dr. Njoo.
But first, julie, thank you for making the time.
I appreciate it. Tell me what is the situation like at sunny brook icu?



Well, at sunny brook we've taken a number of steps to increase capacity for the number of patients we're expecting.
So we have a COVID-19 unit and it is almost at capacity with patients.
We've been really, really busy trying to manage these patients effectively, but our teams have done an incredible job trying to keep everyone well and managing under these extreme circumstances.



**Rosemary**:

How are you doing for personal protective equipment, for ventilators, all those things we're hearing about that we know front-line workers are worried about?



The big concern is masks right now.
It's no surprise we're returning short on supplies.
We have taken the same stance as many of the other hospitals in that we're being allocated two masks per shift, per 12-hour shift, for employees that work in a clinical area.
So that has been very challenging because if you have to go into a patient room, you know it's hot, you have a lot of equipment on, and sweat is pouring down your face and you know, you wonder how protected you really are, so it's a big concern.
People are worried, but they're doing their best.
They're very resilient.
The team is amazing and we've really been working hard to provide the most optimal patientcare.



**Rosemary**:

Health workers are at risk of contracting this virus.
We've seen it in Italy, so many of them have actually died.
How worried are you about your own safety?



Well, you know, it is a big worry.
Every day I've been working 12, 14-hour days and been away from My family to do that, but you know, we have to be super vigilant.
Hand-washing is the best thing to do. The public needs to know that, but for us in the hospital environment, we're diligent about hygiene and ensuring we'reapplying our n95 masks when we need them so we can assure that we're protecting ourselves, because ultimately, myself beingprotected means that I'm protecting My family, too.
and that is what is most important.



**Rosemary**:

I wish I had more time.

We're going to pull away from the main network, but update you what we did hear today.
Domestic travel now on planes and trains, you will be prevented from getting on board if you're showing symptoms of COVID-19. This follows the same designation or decision, about 10 days ago when it came to international flights.
The Prime Minister also saying that if you're waiting or hoping for that emergency benefit, it would be wise to go to the Canada revenue agency website and preregister.
That wraps up our coverage here on CBC.
We'll be back again tomorrow to bring you the latest.
We'll continue our coverage on CBC news network.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Thank you for watching.

**Rosemary**:

Sometimes we have the whole panel of different cabinet ministers.
Today I'm told it will be Dr. Njoo.
Perhaps there will be someone else, but that's what I heard.
and we heard from the Prime Minister.
I'll bring in Vassy kapelos from"power & politics." one of the things the Prime Minister was asked about the restriction on domestic travel, the question was about the fact that we are seeing some encouraging signs, particularly in British Columbia that this physical distancing or social distancing measures seem to be working right now.
We know that because British Columbia sharedextensively modelling that they had.
I know the Prime Minister promised that they would show some numbers and some data whichi understand they're very reliant on the provinces to get that information.
That would be helpful to understand where we are in this pandemic and people are desperate to know when it will end.
Sometimes when you can see the curve and the trend line, that does help you to get a handle onthings.
Maybe I'll put to you the message around if you see a glimmer of hope what the Prime Minister was saying around that.



**Vassy**:

Unsurprisingly the Prime Minister told us a message that even if there are signs of encouragement, that is not a time to take your foot off the brake.
It's a time to double down on them.
The Prime Minister was pretty specific on this, don't go out if you don't have to, don't go to the grocery store more than once a week if you can allow forthat, don't go to work.
He provided a number of example sand I think the message continues to be and it is a difficult line to walk, even from the perspective of public health officials, you do want to -- this is a hunger for that data among all of us. People want to know if the sacrifices we're making and the stress that we're under is for the reason we're told it is. That data is important, but at the same time it's not going to be conclusive at this point.
This is not an hour-long -- we've heard this from Dr. Njoo that this won't be hours, but months.
You want to encourage this behaviour and know that it's going in the right direction, but you don't want Canadians to think we don't have to go hard core because it looks like things are on track.
We heard that message from the Prime Minister and I suspect we'll hear that from Dr. Njoo throughout the afternoon.
There are some glimmers of hope, but it's not the case everywhere.
We have seen in quÉbec, particularly where we know travellers returned earlier thanin much of the rest of the country, their March break is a week, sometimes two weeks, earlier than other provinces, wehave seen huge numbers in that province and even 10 additional deaths.
So a note of caution underlying any of the news and data overalltrend lines.



**Rosemary**:

I know the testing is increasing.
I know British Columbia has done the most testing, last time theychecked.
The country overall has tested over 170, 000 people.
We heard from public health officials yesterday that indeed we are in the top five at any rate in the world for testing per millions.
There is a wide understanding that more testing is needed and more testing is better because then you can understand of course where the virus is, where it is going, and how to contain particular outbreaks in particular parts of the country.
You're right, even though there is some suggestion of good things happening in British Columbia, it would be wrong to think that is the picture across the country.
It would be particularly wrong in Ontario to think things have let up, even though we saw a little change yesterday.
I note what the Prime Minister said why they're seeing that in British Columbia and it's because British Columbia started this two weeks ago that they are seeing some changes now.
If you look at Ontario, for instance, spring break started believe March 13. That was the Friday the government said you shouldn't leave.
People left anyway.
That was a decision that they made.
So a week from that is really when the two weeks of physical distancing starts for Ontario.
So you probably won't see if any of that has worked for, as you say, 10 to 15 days.
You may see numbers go up because the travel continued at the beginning of March for a lot of people and snowbirds are returning as well.
That creates different problems.
They're now being told you have to quarantine.
That is the legal requirement.
We'll come back to you, Vassy, after this press conference, if you don't mind.
We're going to take you to -- oh, they're both there, Dr. Theresa tam, the chief public health officer and Dr. Njoo.



There are 5, 153 cases of COVID-19 including 55 deaths.
In addition, at any point in time, there are many people under investigation awaiting laboratory results or not yet tested.
So even if you are not hearing of cases in your community, it doesn't mean there are no cases or that there are no exposures waiting to happen.
We have now completed tested for over 184, 000 people in Canada, which is more than 84, 000 additional people tested since Monday.
In terms of the severity of COVID-19 in Canada, the percentage of cases that require hospitalization is approximately7%, about 3% are critically ill, and 1% of cases have been fatal.
Please note that 30% of those hospitalized are under 40 years of age.
We continue to keep a close eye on the severity of the disease because although there will be day-to-day fluctuations, a sustained trend of increased severity could point to a higherrate of infection in vulnerable populations or that the health system is being overwhelmed.
I am reminding Canadians not to underestimate the severity of this disease.
The devastating impacts of COVID-19 is evident in europe and parts of the United States.
At the same time, there are signs of hope.
There is a note of cautious optimism from British Columbia, the area of Canada that first experienced community transmission.
It is still too early to know for sure, but after weeks of public health interventions, therate of growth appears to be slowing.
We will be closely looking at British Columbia over the coming weeks for better clarity on the effect of their public health measures.
This early sign of reassurance should spur us to keep up with our new habit of physical distancing, despite the accompanying hardships.
So we need to stay the course.
Yesterday we started a challengefor Canadians to build their bubble of protection and stay inside that bubble.
We need to maintain this zone ofprotection around us to keep thevirus out.
Each of us should ideally have our own separate bubble that is a 2 metre sir crumb frens.
But for couples, families, and other cohabitation, that bubble might mean two or more people orkeeping in a bubble that no one else comes into.
The important thing is to stay in your bubble and not burst someone else's. I would also like to ask people to just check out our Canada.
Ca website for a new interactive map as well as a new detailed epdeemological report that is posted in both languages.
