**Question**:

Hi, thanks for taking My question.
I'm wondering what kind of advice you might be providing to federal officials and maybe even officials at the local and provincial levels who may be concerned about the United States relaxing certain social distancing measures in the coming weeks.
There have been reports of mayors in border towns who have expressed some concerns.
is there any direct advice you could provide to them so far about how to handle that possibility?



**Answer**:

Absolutely we are monitoring what is going on in terms of the actual outbreaks in the United States.
Of course there are many different areas of the United States that are heavily impacted by COVID-19. So I think, as everybody knows, that there are now border measures to reduce the impact of any illness that might come from travellers in the United States.
Those are layered measures and certainly no non-essential travel between the two countriesis very key, while maintaining essential services and those links that are so important between the two countries.
We've also, as you know, have now a mandatory quarantine orderin place, emergency order, that essentially mandate those travellers to undergo 14 days ofself-isolation, so that's mandatory isolation if they travelled anywhere, including the United States.
We will be, of course, isolatinganyone who is sick coming from any country, and that includes the United States as well.
The quarantine act, the federal quarantine act comes with it quite heavily penalties if people are not observing that order.

**Question**:

Hello, I have some questions in french for Dr. Njoo.
Yesterday you explained the situation and you said that it might last for months, which is not very encouraging.
What can Canadians expect? will we be in isolation for an extended period for several months? will we be under quarantine for about a year? what information do you have forcanadians?



**Answer**:

Thank you for this question.
As I said a few moments ago, we can't predict what will happen in the future, but there have been encouraging signs.
For example, the situation in British Columbia.
The number of cases is decreasing in British Columbia, and this may be a sign that the curve is flattening in British Columbia or even in Canada.
It's important that we stay the course, that we not give up. We must continue to practice physical distancing.
We'll monitor the situation week by week, and that way we'll be able to determine the impact that our collective actions are having in slowing the spread of the virus.

---

**Question**:

Follow-up question.
My next question is about Prime Minister trudeau's announcement that he made today.
He said that Canadians who are symptomatic will no longer be able to board planes or trains.
As a public health official, here is My question for you.
How will the employees of airlines and rail companies assess the situation? will they be taking passengers' temperature, for example? what instructions do you have for them at this point?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question.
It's been a while now that we'vebeen telling all Canadians to stay home if they are sick.
We expect that Canadians will follow the instructions of public health experts and stay home.
As for airline employees, we will be monitoring passengers before they board planes aboard in order to see whether they aresymptomatic, but we can't guarantee anything with 100% certainty.
But here is the important thing, if you are sick, do not travel, stay home.
[end of translation].



**Answer**:

The question was what should -- I guess companies, trains and airplanes, ET cetera, for domestic travel that the Prime Minister just announced.
What we're saying is the message at the core is no different.
We've been saying from a public health perspective for several weeks at least that if you are sick, stay at home.
So really I think there is an obligation, I would say, a civic duty for people to understand that if you are sick, you should not be taking a commercial travel means such as an airplane, a flight, or taking a train to go anywhere in the country.
You should be staying at home.
Of course the people actually --or the personnel working for the airlines and the trains, they will do their best.
They will look at people who want to board and look for obvious signs that people are ill.
In terms of very systematic screening, there is no guarantee.
People can hide symptoms and take Tylenol.
At the end of the day, it comes down to our collective understanding and motivation and approach to do the right thing.
If you are sick, don't travel.
Stay at home.



Thank you.
Now we'll take a question in theroom.



Ashley Burke, CBC news.
Can you tell me about plans to run field hospitals.
May they be needed down the line and how soon do you think they would be needed in Canada?



**Answer**:

There's a significant amount of planning in the provinces and territories.
a good example would be from British Columbia even yesterday, where they have systematically planned that different scenario and exactly how much capacity they have.
Public health is going to do whatever it can to reduce the impact of this epidemic so you don't go beyond your capacity tocope.
Having said that, of course you have to prepare for much more worst-case scenarios.
So those things are absolutely happening in the provinces and territories.
We've been in contact with them on a daily basis.
So they are already planning alternative care sites, how to care for people who are not so sick outside of the hospitals designated for COVID-19, for example.
So the idea is to -- already they're freeing up I. C.u. Beds and the intensive care illnesseshave to be taken care of in a hospital setting and have to look after people who could be looked after in alternative sites.
All of that is in play, even though right now Canada is coping.
So those calculations -- I wouldactually encourage people to have a look at the example of British Columbia where the numbers are quite well articulated.

---

**Question**:

My other question is you talked about the optimism in British Columbia and the modelling there.
Will the federal government be sharing their same modelling with us?



**Answer**:

Absolutely.
As I said, there is an EPA deem logic report posted.
We have to look at other countries that have done before us, looking at their experience and where we're tracking.
That is absolutely the intent.
I want to flag that the national aggregated picture must be supplemented by the provincial and local picture because different areas of Canada are actually experiencing this outbreak, it's just slightly different trajectories and timelines.
Unpacking what is underneath a national picture I think is veryimportant.
So I of course am very happy that British Columbia -- we have been supporting different provinces to do their projections.

---

**Question**:

When are you planning on releasing that publicly?



**Answer**:

Some of that data is already now since today or last night already on our website.
You know, we'll be making as much of that available as possible.
I have to just caution that of course modelling is modelling.
That's just planning scenarios.
What you have to look at is the EPA determinologic report where things are trending.



Next question.

---

**Question**:

Today the Prime Minister announced there will be further screening on domestic travellers, air travel and traintravel.
Should we not be taking these steps at a local level? what good is it if we're screening a person a long distance in Canada, but then not for those getting on a bus or riding in a taxi?



**Answer**:

So there are -- I think you would observe that all across Canada, the provinces and the municipalities are taking this really seriously.
They are already stopping gatherings.
They are advising this 2-metre distance on transportation.
That includes buses and other things, where as much as possible you're doing physical distancing.
So all of those measures are already being implemented in the local jurisdictions.
While maintaining a balance.
Society has to go about as much as possible maintaining essential functioning while doing physical distancing.
Obviously each of the municipalities, the cities in very different situations -- Toronto isn't going to be the same as a more rural area, for example.
So I think that every level of government is doing whatever it needs to, to maintain that physical distancing.



If I could add to that in My previous answer, certainly governments and companies can put whatever measures in place.
They're never going to be full-proof.
Someone can take a tylenol if you have a fever or hide symptoms.
It is a collective responsibility, but for each citizen in Canada to understand and appreciate, it's important that important role they can play.
If you're sick, stay home, don'ttake public transportation.



a follow up.

**Question**:

My second question was with regard to the United States.
Obviously it's a bit of a wildfire situation there.
Cities like Detroit are hot spots, also in Washington state near the border.
I know you've spoken a bit aboutthis, but there has been concern addressed by, say, the city of Windsor across the river from Detroit.
Should we be satisfied with the ban on non-essential travel or do we need to step up our borderenforcement and border closures with the United States, granted that the some reckless directionthey're taking?



**Answer**:

What I've just said, it's not just reducing the non-essential travel.
We do have an emergency order under our federal quarantine actthat are ordering travellers to isolate if they're sick, but also mandatory quarantine of anyone who is symptomatic.
They will have to go directly home if they have a home.
If they don't have a home, the federal government will be housing people in our federal quarantine facilities.
As I said, the penalties are pretty heavy.
Now, let's just say that even ona daily basis we do have instances.
We have truck drivers who have been stopped and have been put in a federal quarantine site because they have shown even mild symptoms.
That's happening in real time right now.
Then they get tested and if they're okay, they can continue.
If they're not, they're staying in our quarantine sites.



Thank you.
Operator, over to the line for two questions.



The next question is from Theresa wright from the Canadian press." your line is open.

**Question**:

Good afternoon, Dr. Tam.
Yesterday we heard that the number of patients in I. C.u. S doubled in Ontario in less than two days.
How concerned are you about thisspike, especially considering that I. C.u. For the first parts of hospital symptoms to be overwhelmed in places like italyand spain?



**Answer**:

Yes, so I think that's -- as I said, we have to monitor the severity of illness very carefully because if there's increasing quickly ill people, the key spike is going to occur if health symptoms are overwhelmed.
So having enough I. C.u. Facilities is very, very important.
So that has to be tracked.
Right now all jurisdictions are coping with the numbers, but they are planning to do more, even Ontario and British Columbia and many jurisdictions have actually emptied out probably half of thei.
C.u. S just to make sure they are already prepared for any influx.
But of course from a public health perspective, we just do not want people to end up in thei.
C.u. So on the prevention side, basedon what we understand, a lot of the I. C.u. Patients in a number of jurisdictions are people fromlong-term care facilities.
They are the older population and people with underlying medical conditions.
That's why we really, really stress that we have to protect these populations, otherwise we would have more I. C.u. Admissions.
So I think unpacking the epidemiology underneath, the people that are critically ill, shows us that they are the vulnerable and elderly.
So long-term care facilities, making sure that nobody sort of introduces the virus there and absolutely no introduction into hospitals and other places wherevulnerable people go, but also on an individual level.
Do not go anywhere near someone who is vulnerable or older in your family even or your friends, do not impact them because you will see increase inserious illness if that is the case.
So maintain that bubble and definitely keep the bubble away from anyone who is vulnerable.
But based on what I've seen so far, the health system is able to manage the patients.



One follow up.

**Question**:

Just on the announcement from the Prime Minister about passengers boarding domestic flights and trains not being able to board if they have symptoms.
Can you provide details about how they will be screened and how the new powers given to airline and train companies will be enforced.



**Answer**:

I think those detail swill come in the coming days and obviously working closely with the Minister of transport.
That -- I think the media and the public will get the information as we -- as the -- as that unfolds.
So stay tuned.



Operator, next question on the line.



Thank you.
The next question is from Melanie marquis from ""la presse". your line is open.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] what will be done specifically to protect airline and train companies, how will they assess symptoms? will they be taking passengers' temperature? will that burden fall on their shoulders and will this be occurring as of Monday on train sand flights?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question.
As Dr. Tam said, we are working closely with our colleagues at transport Canada, as well as with train and airline companies, train companies such as via rail.
We are working with our partners to develop a protocol.
This will take a little while.
The announcement was made and we will have details soon.

---

**Question**:

Okay.
But could you clarify something and then I'll ask a follow-up question.
We've heard a lot of people saying that things are not working at the airport, that passengers are allowed to board flights unchecked, that there are no controls.
So the system is already problematic.
Here is My next question for you, Dr. Njoo.
What about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine? does Canada have a stance on those drugs? are there clinical trials going on in Canada?



**Answer**:

Thank you for those questions.
Your first question was about protocol and procedures that travel companies will follow.
The answer is, yes, we have a protocol and procedures.
It's exactly what's being done at our borders.
This is being done for all those who currently board planes and trains as of Monday.
We have a multi-facetted, integrated system.
We have measures at our shared border.
We are trying to prevent all infection.
That is the job of all governments and that is also theresponsibility of all Canadians.
Everyone had a part to play.
We are asking those who are sickto stay home and to not take public transit.
That's the first thing.
Second thing, of course we want airline and train companies employees to be safe.
If passengers are visibly ill and visibly symptomatic, they will not be able to board.
This is just one aspect of our measures.
If a passenger seems ill, that person should immediately self-isolate.
The federal government has jurisdiction over our international borders.
So the federal government is responsible for all travellers who arrive at our international borders, be it at our airports or at the Canada-United States border.
There are two elements to our response.
First, for those who are symptomatic, we will take care of them.
We will put them in a hotel or in another federal quarantine facility.
Or if they are not symptomatic, we will tell them to immediatelygo home and self-isolate.
For asymptomatic travellers who are not ill, who do not exhibit any symptoms, they must also go home immediately and stay home because that is a federal quarantine order.
[end of translation].



**Answer**:

For domestic what we've been saying is any screening, be it at our international borders, at the airports, or even now domestically at train stations or people boarding a domestic flight, it's only one aspect.
It's never 100% guaranteed that we're going to stop further transmission of infection.
Personnel at train stations, youknow, even at the airports looking at passengers about to board domestic flights, they'll be doing what they need to do in terms of looking for people withsymptoms, illness, if people look unwell.
That's not a guarantee.
We know people can hide symptoms by taking a Tylenol to mask a fever.
So at the end of the day I thinkit's not just the responsibility of governments, airline companies, train companies, it'sa responsibility of every Canadian.
If you are sick, stay at home.
Don't take the chance of exposing others to the infection that you have.
So I think that's about as clear as we can say it and we've said it many, many times and I think it bears repeating.
The other point I was making was for travellers who come at our international borders that is under a federal responsibility mandate.
That's very strict.
Since March 25 when we put a new order in. All individuals, travellers, who come to Canada from outside are subject to a mandatory quarantine order.
That's very straightforward.
If we find you at the border, I mean we collectively, the government of Canada agents, and you are sick, we will either put you in a federal quarantine facility and look after you and make sure you get the proper care and treatment.
Or if you have mild symptoms, we will arrange for transportation for you to get home for immediate isolation to not leave your residence and you're declared to be recovered.
For those travellers who come to the border who do not have symptoms and are looking and feeling well, they are also under a federal quarantine order.
They are ordered to proceed directly to their residence and stay there.
As I said before, that means very strictly that they should not be leaving their property.
They should arrange for their family and friends to get groceries for them.
It's quite strict.
To be honest, one of the things we recognize and we're working through with provincial authorities, at the end of the day, it's a provincial -- federal order, but these people living in provinces and territories.
In rural Nova Scotia on a farm, it might be easier to comply with the federal order and stay on your property than if you live in a condo in Montreal.
 [voice of interpreter] the question about hydroxychloroquine, there are currently trials looking into whether it is an effective treatment.
Thus far, there is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19. We are following all experiments in Canada and around the world with this drug.
It's important that people be aware that this is an or not medication, an important drug for treating other diseases.
So we don't want there to be a shortage of this medication to treat other conditions because people think it's a treatment for COVID-19. There is no conclusive proof that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, however, we do know for a fact it is effective for treating other medical conditions.

**Question**:

Thank you so much for your time.
I was just wondering what -- I know obviously our travel restrictions in place for travellers coming across the board border and in any directions, but the cross-borderworkers, what restrictions are being placed on those people?



**Answer**:

So those providing essential services or that their daily work happens to be across the border, even though they have -- we're not asking them to stay in a certain place for the 14 days.
There are strict directions to them of self monitoring.
They have to avoid crowds, do all the social distancing measures that we expect everyone to do and monitor the symptoms and report them.
We also have been in touch with employers for setting up measures to monitor their employees as well.
So if you are going across the border for any reason, there is a collective responsibility on behalf of the employee and employer and the governments who are trying to ensure the safety of each of those citizens.
So it is not to say that these workers can do whatever they want.
They must essentially self-isolate as much as possible.
They have to do the social distancing and monitor the symptoms.

---

**Question**:

Okay, but there is obviously no strict 14-day isolation upon their return.
They are welcome to go to a grocery store or seek other services in town if necessary?



**Answer**:

So the direction is to avoid crowds and avoid contact with the public as much as possible.
If you were a pilot that's just come in and of course you have to fly back out again in order to do your job, but what public health is telling them, go straight to your hotel, do not leave the hotel, get your food ordered, and go back on the plane.

---

**Question**:

Perfect.
If I may, a follow-up question.



Sure.

---

**Question**:

Are there any additional cleaning measures in place for the products crossing the border, as there are concerns the virus could remain on the products themselves? I apologize, the products or goods or services -- not services, but goods being shipped across the border to the United States or those being received into Canada, are there any additional cleaning measures to these products before they're distributed to the public?



**Answer**:

We'll follow on that because this is obviously to do with other departments, but we work very close with them.
We can get the answer to your question as a follow up.



We'll take a question from the room.

---

**Question**:

Hi, yesterday the health Minister talked about how there were -- they were trying to procure ventilators at a federal level for all the provinces and territories, but mentioned that there were a couple provinces and territories in particular that were trying to order these themselves so they weren't getting them through the federal government.
Do you know what provinces those are and what's the problem with that?



**Answer**:

I think obviously different provinces can procure different products.
At a time when there's a general scarcity in supply, we absolutely encourage jurisdiction to come together and be part of our collective purchasing.
That doesn't necessarily preclude jurisdictions, but there are many advantages in being part of the bulk purchasing because everyone is looking for the products.
If we pull our requirements together, we will stand a better chance to get access to some of these as well.
The federal government can help if the product comes from another country, one can help facilitate some of those access and transportation for -- and distribution, for example.
So it's -- it is a collective measure, but we cannot essentially dictate what individual jurisdictions might do, but collectively we stand a better chance to get access to scarce resources.
But on top of that, the federal government has added an extra layer of protection, which is even if no orders have been in place for the provinces and territories, we're actually purchasing them pre-emptively should they be required.

---

**Question**:

So, sorry, what provinces are going out on their own and getting their own ventilators rather than federally?



**Answer**:

I don't have that specific information, but we certainly encourage everybody to be part of that purchase order.

---

**Question**:

and the data you just mentioned that was uploaded on your website last night, can you tell us what your big take-away from that is that Canadians should know, when you look at that new data, what kindof a picture it paints?



**Answer**:

Well, I think certainly this is a serious illness.
The picture it would take is that there are definitely serious consequences of hospitalizations, I. C.u. Care requirements, as well as of course the mortality or deaths.
But I think it would also tell us that even though some of the impacts on the older population, it doesn't mean that the youngerpopulation isn't impacted.
The bulk of the illnesses are inthe younger age groups and some severe illnesses do occur, whilethe heaviest impacts are on the older age groups.
I think also it is there to set a national trend to see where things are trending.
As I've just said, British Columbia of course is an area that was impacted, but it will show you the curve for each of the jurisdictions and where the cases are.
So if you clicked on the M.P. yes, it will show you the numberby province, but it will show you the numbers over time for each of those jurisdictions as well.
So trending -- the national surveillance is important for trends.
There will be some sort of as I said age group breakdowns as well.
I just want to emphasize that ofcourse if the trends are slowingdown a bit, our key message is not to relax.
Our key message is to double down, absolutely double down.
Right now is an absolutely critical time.
If you looked at those numbers, you realize that we're definitely not out of the woods and we've got to keep going.
 [voice of interpreter] we must keep it up. [end of translation].



Thank you.
Next question, which will be the last one.

---

**Question**:

There are reports in the United States that the c. D.c. is going to recommend that all americans going out in public are going to wear masks.
While we've talked about masks before not being wholly effective for members of the public, if the c. D.c. Were to goahead with this, is that something that perhaps we'll be headed to in Canada? can you speak about whether that's something we should be considering?



**Answer**:

Well, we always evaluate new data as it comes along.
Our position now is put a mask on someone with symptoms if they should need essential services.
If you have symptoms, you have to stay around.
You should not be wandering around the community.
If you need to get to a medical facility, at that point in time, that mask might be useful because now you have infectious droplets that you might send to others, but the key is to keep that 2-metre distance.
Masks have to be utilized appropriately too.
Most people have not learned how to use masks.
There are many practical aspects to this.
Our advice is there is no need to use a mask for well people.



Thank you.
