**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily update on how his government is dealing with the pandemic, COVID-19. Some details today, first, that we will hear more about actually tomorrow about help for businesses in this country.
You might remember the government last week decided to increase the available wage subsidy it had previously announced all the way up to 75%. well, the big change in what we heard from the Prime Minister today is that it will now apply to companies big and small.
It doesn't matter how many employees you have.
If you feel you need the wage subsidy to keep your employees on the payroll and pay them up to 75% and -- rather, have the government subsidize them up to 75%, they will do that.
The number of employees does notmatter.
and importantly, and I know this is something many people have been asking about, it does apply to not-for-profit and charities.
They can also use this wage subsidy moving forward.
Those details are coming tomorrow.
We're going to leave you here oncbc television.
If you want to see the noon coverage, we're on cbc news network and on cbc.
Ca. I'm rosemary barton.
See you back tomorrow.
Thank you for watching.
[♪♪♪]



**Rosemary**:

Welcome back to our ongoing CBC news special.
I'm rosemary Barton here in Ottawa.
Thank you for joining us on CBC news network and streaming around the world on CBC.
Ca. In just a few moments we will hear from federal officials on the pandemic.
We are waiting to see if these physical distancing measures we are taking are really going to pay off.
There is a hope and a desire from the health officials that they will.
They have seen some glimmers of hope in British Columbia, for instance.
Today we will hear from Canada'stop soldier, the chief of the defence staff, to talk about possible military involvement.
The Prime Minister announced that, but he said we will wait to see if there will be involvement.
We have Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane joining us. Vassy, to me, the biggest deal is that it now applies everywhere big and small.
You can tap into this if you think it can help.



**Vassy**:

The way I read that, and if it changes tomorrow, correct me if I am wrong, it sounds like there will not be a cap per employer.
That was one of the huge questions that self-employed andsmall- and medium-sized businesses had.
Before there was a cap.
That means this applies, as you rightly pointed out, rosie, not only to restaurants that employee 20 or 30 people, but could be an employer that employees 1, 000 people.
The specifics here, there are a few the Prime Minister gave, that are relevant.
Up to 75% of your salary on the first $58, 700 that you earn.
It will be up to $847.
This applies to big and small businesses.
It doesn't sound like there is an overall cap.
The overall cost of the program will probably be large, but I think that headline is certainlysomething that a lot of businesses will be paying attention to. The other thing he mentioned was30%, so you have to have -- yourrevenues have to have declined by 30% compared to prior to the start of this pandemic.
So the granular details there as well, what is the time frame you're looking at over time period will be significant.
But really the big news here is that it will apply to small and medium and large-sized businesses.



**Rosemary**:

and that non-profits and charities because many of them had been asking for help.
David, one of the things the Prime Minister was asked about but didn't give an answer other than to say we'll see.
a lot of the business owners that are e-mailing me saying that's nice, but I won't be ableto pay rent tomorrow or in two days.
I can bring all these employees back on the payroll or keep themon the payroll, but if there's no business to come back to, I'mnot sure how that helps me.



**David**:

There's a couple of things.
Rent relief is a provincial issue.
The rental markets are controlled provincially.
That's something various provinces are going to have to take measures on when rent is being furloughed, for lack of a better word.
I think the view of the federal government right now is the $40, 000 interest-free credit lines being made available to small businesses, that's what you can use to pay your rent.
I had a little bit more clarity on the wage subsidy, some details from government officials when all of this was going on. The $847 a week up to that amount.
That is for every employee you have whether you are open are not.
The salary cap of $58, 700, that number wasn't plucked out of thin air.
That is the maximum amount of earnings that qualify under c. P.p. As pensionable income.
That is why they have gone with that number.
You will get up to $847 a week for your employees whether or not your open.
That is an important point.
The 25% top-up is not a requirement, but do it if you can.
The two examples used, a trucking company in quÉbec, theywould have a revenue stream and they could do it. The salon shut down in calgary cannot because they've been shutdown for public health concerns.
The cost of this is going to be staggering because they are essentially underwriting the first 0.75 on every dollar for every employee in the country.
In terms of the test and the consequences that he talked about, the 30% revenue drop, that will be assessed after the fact.
If you are found to have not hada 30% revenue drop, there will be a repayment requirement of some form.
I don't know if it's a total amount, if it comes in at 27.5 and you think it's 30. That's how they're going to dealwith it. Every business, take daycares inthis city, I've got a kid in daycare.
That daycare is shut down right now.
There is no revenue coming in. The owner of that daycare will qualify for a 75% wage subsidy.
They can maintain their relationship with their employerand the minute all of this is lifted, they can go back to workwithout having to reapply after being laid off.
It maintains that relationship and puts a financial floor underthe payrolls of basically every company and non-profit in the country depending on how this will apply.
It allows them to come back quicker.
That's what this is also about too, preparing everybody for thetime when all of theme extreme measures are over and things cancome back.
Like we've seen from the c. E.r. V. is the policy will be pay first and ask questions later.
They will deal with payments, repayments, and fraud after the fact.



**Rosemary**:

Interesting really for the first time we did hear from the Prime Minister -- it hasn't been the case so much with the Canada emergency benefit, it's the priority to get the money out to people as quickly as possible, but here the Prime Minister calling for good faith and trust for all involved and telling businesses, don't bother trying to take this because we will get you.



**David**:

This is a very big carrot so it needs to be backed up by a big stick.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to leave you two.
I'm going to bring back Dr. Isaac bogoch.
I cut him off but it was for the prime Minister.
We were talking before the Prime Minister, doctor, about why this week is so important.
Give us your sense of why it is important to watch from a public health perspective.



**Isaac Bogoch**:

Certainly this week we will see if the social distancing or physical distancing measures are paying off.
There are shreds of evidence from British Columbia that maybethey're going to start to see a reduced number of new cases per day.
Let's see if that pans out over time.
We really start to see that pickup in Ontario.
That will be important because there was certainly a greater number of cases in Ontario day by day.
Quite frankly, we have to flatten the curve here to prevent the healthcare system from getting overwhelmed.



**Rosemary**:

Well, I have to say, the amount of testing in Ontario, I don't know if it's the backlog or the number of tests, seems worrying because it would lead me to believe there are more cases than we know about.
B.c., Quebec, and Alberta are testing people proportionally many more.
Ontario says it's hoping to do 5, 000 a day by early this week, surging into April.
Would you agree that this sort of testing in Ontario is, perhaps, troubling because it doesn't give us a really good picture of what's happening?



**Isaac Bogoch**:

100%, I agree with you 100%. we need to be doing better.
This is not the time to be scaling back on testing.
It's nice to hear that for April, but we need that today.
It's extremely important to have better understanding of the true burden of infection, both here in Ontario and elsewhere incanada.
You've seen places like Alberta and British Columbia lead the way, and quÉbec is picking up speed, but it has to be better in Ontario.



**Rosemary**:

What is the reasoning? is it that they're limiting it to a particular section of people, healthcare workers, older people, or people that have been abroad? what is your understanding why the testing isn't happening?



**Isaac Bogoch**:

I think there'sseveral issues.
Certainly there was lab capacity issues which we heard about this backlog which is slowly getting resolved and I think there was now about a week ago where we'veheard from the Minister of health reducing the bureaucratic hurdles to get testing kits allowed in Canada.
I think we will see an explosion of tests in Ontario.
My concern is the delay.
This is a crucial week and last week and the week ahead are such pivotal points here.
We need all the data we can find.
This helps guide the public health response and clinical management.
Diagnostic testing is one of the main or multiple pillars of epidemiology management.
You can't fight blindly.
If we really do start to expand to 5, 000 a day and hopefully more than that, I think we will be in a better position in pont.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Bogoch, I'm going to cut you off for the deputy Prime Minister.
Here is the deputy Prime Minister.



Practice physical distancing.
I know that it is hard, but we all must stay strong and stay at home unless we are doing essential work like stocking the shelves in our grocery stores, like working on the front lines of our healthcare system.
Of course you can go for a walk or a run, but maintain your distance while you do it and wash your hands, please, when you get home.
 [voice of interpreter] this is a critical week in our fight against the virus.
Canadians must practice social distancing and physical distancing.
We must remain strong and stay home unless you're an essential worker, such as filling grocery shelves or working in the healthcare field.
You can go out for a walk.
You can go running, but stay apart from others and wash your hands as soon as you get home.
I know it's very difficult to do, but we can accomplish this.
[end of translation] today you will hear from Dr. Tam, the Minister of national defence, harjit sajjan.
Pablo Rodriguez, our Minister of health patty hajdu, general Vance, Dr. Njoo.
We are trying to spread ourselves out which is why you don't see them at the podium, but they are available for your questions.
Dr. Tam.



Hello, everyone.
In Canada there are 6, 671 cases, including 66 deaths.
In addition, at any point in time there are many other people under investigation forcovid-19. They are awaiting lab results or not yet testing.
Even if you're not hearing of cases in your community, it doesn't mean that there are no cases or no exposures waiting tohappen.
We now have completed tests for over 220, 000 people in Canada, with about 3% of the people confirmed as positive and over 93% confirmed as negative.
So of the over 6, 000 cases that we know about right now, approximately 7% are requiring hospitalization and 3% are critically ill, with 1% having been fatal.
This is data for what is happening in real time so we can expect these rates to fluctuate as and when the provinces report new information.
 [voice of interpreter] there have been reports of cases in communities that are at high risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19. Notably, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in nunavikin northern quÉbec this past weekend.
In addition, there continue to be outbreaks in long-term care facilities leading to devastating outcomes.
Preventive measures are crucial to prevent the acceleration of spread in enclosed environments, where persons with underlying medical conditions reside.
Prevention is a key part of our pandemic response.

It is crucial to prevent the acceleration of spread in enclosed environments where persons with underlying medical conditions reside and it is a key part of our pandemic response.
With the warm weather pro temporing, I want to reiterate My message from yesterday.
Our key message is on returning travellers and protecting those in vulnerable communities.
For travellers returning from outside of Canada, snowbirds, March break vacationers, and others, you are required to takethe right action to protect all Canadians, head directly home, do not stop for groceries or other essential supplies, use the phone to order what you need, but do not go out into public spaces.
Once home, you are required to be there and quarantine yourself.
Like, some important observancers are coming up, including easter, passover, ramadan.
Now is the time when all assembly needs to happen virtually.
Prepare ahead to connect throughsocial media and over the phone and internet.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Now we will hear from the Minister of defence.



Good afternoon, everyone.
When Canada needs their armed forces, they are always there.
It shows that in times of great difficulty, Canadians never face hardship alone.
They fought for Canadian values during the great wars, have been there for our friends and partners in the pacific and Ukraine and in the middle east.
They have been there for communities like Newfoundland this year and for floods in quÉbec and Ontario or forest fires like those that hit Alberta and British Columbia in previous years.
We developed our defence policy, strong, secure, engaged, in order to support our armed forces to be prepared and equipped to deal with the challenges that lay ahead.
Now, during these unprecedented times, those who wear the uniform will be there for Canadians when called upon.
That is why we took precautionary measures early to ensure that the forces remained ready.
It is why early in this crisis the chief of defence staff directed many of them to engage in physical distancing, to stay home and to be healthy and ready to respond.
From the beginning, the canadianarmed forces have been part of the whole-of-government effort in our fight against COVID-19. We are the men and women in uniform assisting bringing Canadians home from china and japan to c. F.b. Trenton.
Over the past weeks, I have beenin contact with My internationalpartners and colleagues to learnfrom their experiences.
With that information and looking at the possible needs across Canada, I directed the chief of defence staff to develop a plan that would allow us to support a domestic response to COVID-19 based around three priorities.
To support the efforts to splo the spread of COVID-19, to provide support to vulnerable communities across Canada, to assist our provincial and territorial partners with logistics, including directly supporting municipalities if needed.
and I also want to stress that this response to COVID-19 would occur while still maintaining our ability to respond to possible flooding or forest fires.
Based on this guidance, the chief of defence staff has developed a plan that would see the canadian armed forces mobilizing up to 24, 000 regular and reserve members across the canadian armed forces to supportthese efforts.
The canadian army have readied 10, 000 members across Canada.
They can play a critical role inproviding humanitarian support and delivering supplies.
They will be ready to respond tosupport Canadians, no matter where they live.
Also made available, reservists and canadian rangers are being brought into full-time service and will be part of an integrated canadian armed forcesresponse.
These flexible teams are capableof operating as local response forces to assist with humanitarian response, wellness checks, natural disaster response, and other tasks as required.
I also want to emphasize that particular attention was given to indigenous and northern and arctic communities.
This -- these needs directed ourplanning.
That is why over 50 canadian ranger patrols will be availableto enhance our understanding of the needs of the northern, remote, and indigenous communities and we will be readyto respond as required.
Our royal canadian air force hasall necessary capabilities and personnel to support a whole-of-government support the efforts against COVID-19. The royal canadian navy are alsoready to respond on short noticeto coastal communities who mightneed a helping hand.
We are moving forward with this plan to help support Canadians, no matter where they live, when, and where it is needed.
Though we have not yet received any formal requests for assistance, the team at the department of national defence and I continue to worm with Minister blair and public safetycanada so we are ready when called upon.
We will provide local commandersthe authority to be flexible in our assistance to ensure that local needs are met quickly.
As I've said before, the canadian armed forces remain ready to help Canadians during these challenging circumstances, while at the same time ensuring that the canadian armed forces will be there to support communities that may be impactedby spring flooding and forest fires.
The decision that we made early has made sure that the canadian armed forces is health and stands ready to serve.
We will be ready to take strong precautions so that the men and women who serve will stay healthy and be ready to help.
The plan we have done will allowyour forces to respond to COVID-19 at home and to protect communities impacted by natural disasters, while allowing us to continue the work we do with ourallies and partners to support international security.
We will be there.
We are ready to help.
No matter how challenging the circumstances, when called upon, the canadian armed forces are ready to serve.
To all our canadian armed forcesmembers and their families, thank you for your service.



Now I'll give the floor to the government house leader, Pablo Rodriguez.



[voice of interpreter] our message is that we are ready and we have asked the armed forces to establish a mobilization plan so that they can be prepared to go where needed and quickly.
We're talking about 24, 000 members of regular or reserve members, whether in the royal Canadian air force, the royal Canadian navy, and our intervention plan, if required, would be based on three priorities.
First of all, to slow the speed of spreading of COVID-19, providing support to vulnerable communities throughout the country, and to help our f. P.t. Partners in the area of logistics and, specifically, supporting municipalities concretely.
We might be able to use our helicopters to support isolated communities, whether they be indigenous communities.
We might be able to support provinces and municipalities directly in their efforts.
We could also help with logistics, transportation of material, humanitarian assistance throughout where provinces and territories would need help.
We know that the work could be related to something else.
When we're talking about floods and forest fires, our troops would be able to provide that support, but also having the capacity to support the fight against coronavirus.
But let's be clear, as the Minister said, we are not planning to deploy our forces atthis point.
We have daily contact with the provinces and territories.
For now no premier has asked us to deploy our troops.
It is fundamental that we continue to discuss and exchangeand collaborate with the provinces.
That is essentially what we're saying today is that we are ready to intervene if a premier asks us officially to do so. The planning that the armed forces has done will allow them to deploy quickly to help Canadians who need that help andwill be there for all Canadians, regardless of where they are.
We won't forget anybody.



Thank you very much, Pablo.
[end of translation].



We'll start with questions from the phone.
Operator.



Thank you.
Merci.
If you have a question, please press star 1 on your telephone key pad.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] hello.
My question is for you, madam Freeland.
I know that details will be forthcoming tomorrow from Mr. Morneau, but could you indicate why the government has changed view, deciding that this wage subsidy would not be limited to s. M.e. S, but would apply to all companies?



**Answer**:

We haven't changed a view.
All we've done is clarify the details.
and the details we've established are necessary and correct for the Canadian economy.
We understand that coronavirus and the economic impact of coronavirus does not make any distinction between large companies, small companies, or medium-sized companies.
The idea of this program is to help all canadian businesses to conserve jobs.
We know that businesses want to maintain their workforce and we know that for Canadians who havework at this point, it's much better to have that work available to them.
That's why we established this huge economic program to help employers to conserve their businesses, but also to conservejobs for their workers.
This program is a very good addition to the program we already announced.
That is the program to help Canadians who do not have a job, who have lost their job, or who cannot work because of coronavirus.
With those two programs, we haveone program to help people who cannot work and we have another program to help companies to maintain the jobs of their workers.
That's tremendously important inthis context.
Further to that, we have also helped companies and the economyby providing a great amount of financial resources.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

Second question.
The question is perhaps for Mr. Rodriguez or perhaps Mr. Sajjan could answer that.
In relation to the Canadian armed forces and your capacity to deploy them, there's a community, an indigenous community, nabitibi, that sent letter asking the army to come, in order to ensure a state of emergency.
They want to close off their territory.
Are you taking up that request by other communities or should it go before a premier of a province first? [end of translation] do you want me to translate?



**Answer**:

We've got translation.
We are in touch with many remotecommunities, especially indigenous communities.
The chief of defence staff has been planning kind of early measures of what we can do. More importantly, there's also steps that can be taken early on, not just with the Canadian armed forces, but also with the provinces and territories.
So we're taking every request very seriously.
I want to remind that the Canadian armed forces is a whole-of-government response.
So when we look at a concern that comes up, we look at all the things in our toolbox, down to the municipality, so we can ensure the right response is there so Canadians impacted willbe looked after.



The next question is from bill curry from "the globe and mail".

---

**Question**:

Thank you.
My question is for ms. Freeland.
In terms of large companies and future announcements, is the government considering director ownership stakes, like we saw with the auto sector in 2009.
Will there be anything in terms of executive compensation and is the government concerned about foreign takeovers of companies during this period?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question, bill.
I think as you probably expect, I am not today going to pre-emptfuture announcements.
I will say to you, and I would like to assure all Canadians, that we very much understand that particular sectors of the economy, whether it is tourism and aviation or the energy sector, are facing particular strains because of the impact ofthe coronavirus, both in Canada and worldwide.
We are very mindful of that and it is something that we are definitely focused on.



One follow-up.

---

**Question**:

Yes, on another topic.
Since the service Canada offices shut down, there's been a lot of stories about people not able to reach an official on a phone to answer their questions.
They're not able to get help in person as trying to get e. I. is the government trying to re-open these offices? how are you dealing with this problem?



**Answer**:

Of course it's very important for Canadians to have access to the government programs we've put in place over the last couple of weeks and we are working hard to ensure Canadians can have access to those programs, even as we are thoughtful about and mindful of the need to be maintaining physical distancing in our daily lives and the need to ensure that people who work for the government of Canada are also safe as they do their work.
I know that it is hard for all of us, whether it is in the delivery of government programs or whether it is, as Dr. Tam was describing for returning snowbirds, to not go to the grocery store and to figure out how to order their groceries online or over the phone.
It is not easy to operate in an economy and in a society where we all have to practice physicaldistancing, but it's what we have to do. I do want to say to all the Canadians who need access to these programs, we get it. That's why we have put these programs in place.
I really apologize sincerely for some of the kinks in the delivery of these programs, but I want to assure people we are working 24/7 to get support out to Canadians.



The next question is from Bruce campion-smith from the "toronto star."

---

**Question**:

I wonder if you could speak more specifically about the type of help that the military might be able to provide.
In the United States we're seeing the military there provide field hospitals, military engineers to help re-engineer civilian spacesto makeshift hospitals.
I'm wondering practically what we could see if the help for provinces came.



**Answer**:

Speaking with secretary es per on a number of the last few days on what they've been doing, but it's also to keep in mind, every situation is going to be very different here.
What we're doing is making sure that we have a force that we're able to respond to the various needs.
We are the last resort when it comes to providing support.
So the composition that we have created and the priorities that we have set out is making sure we are flexible and making sure we can respond directly, whether there is a surge in the need, whether it's a northern community that needs direct support, whether it's a logistical support.
So there's a wide range of support that allows the canadianarmed forces to respond.
The chief is going to go into a few details of it, but just keep in mind that we are able to respond across the country with particular attention to the north and the arctic.
Chief.



Thanks, Minister.
If I could start off, I would like to say and offer condolences to people suffering.
On behalf of the armed forces, it's a tough time.
We've been preparing for a long time for this.
We have good plans in place.
We have the troops sequestered, staying as healthy as possible so we can mount many people if we need to. That's a great question.
We are going to be able to respond either with specialist capabilities, like medical, logistics, engineering for a short-duration event or for longer-duration events, depending on the needs of the provinces.
We're also looking at significant responses.
In the event that communities start to suffer multiple events, including floods, forest fires inside a COVID-19 environment, where the armed forces will be able to put in place necessary support to critical infrastructure, logistics, as well as some medical support.
It's scaleable, bruce, dependingon the nature of the problem.
Thank you.



Bruce, one follow-up? okay.
We'll turn to the room for threequestions before we go back on the phone.

---

**Question**:

This is a question for you and ms. Hajdu if you would like to comment.
I would like to hear your thoughts.
Dr. Tam, a few days ago you said well person does not need to wear a mask, but when you take look at countries that have done quite well, china, Taiwan, and others, the culture is to wear masks.
is Canada telling people not to wear masks because we are worried about a shortage and we want to make sure doctors and other front line health workers have them?



**Answer**:

I think there's two separate reasons.
For sure, absolutely, we want to protect our front line healthcareworkers.
Prioritizing supply in that setting is critically important.
We're looking at different avenues to procure.
For the public, I think the current scientific evidence we are continuing to evaluate, of course we can be flexible if we find any new evidence, but I think the scientific evidence is if you are sick, put on a mask to prevent those droplets from flying in any space as perhaps you're going to a clinic or having to move yourself around the community for essential needs.
Putting a mask on an asymptomatic person is not beneficial obviously if you're not infected.
If you have a close contact of Case and under certain circumstances, especially -- you would also be in self-isolation if you were in close contact of a case and you also need to movefor any essential reason, that'sperhaps another situation.
What we worry about is actually the potential negative aspects of wearing masks, where people are not protecting their eyes orother aspects of where the viruscould enter your body, and that gives you a false sense of confidence.
But also it increases the touching of your face if you think about it. If you've got a mask around yourface, sometimes you can't help it because you're touching partsof your face.
The other thing is the outside of the mask could be contaminated as well.
The key is hand washing.
It doesn't matter what you're doing, hand washing is key.
Even in the hospital setting, wefind that it's removing personalprotective equipment that can actually lead to infection.
If people try to use these measures, they have to be really, really careful and wash their hands.
We're also worried about the potentially negative impacts.

---

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] -- expect to get more accurate testing.
You've said right now that 93 was the percentage of people whoare deemed to be negative.
Can you tell us the accuracy of the testing.
and what is the accuracy level, is there a number we can know?



**Answer**:

The tests available at the present time are what we call real-time p. C.r. They have been validated by the national microbiology lab.
So these tests are highly performing, but of course when you're taking a swab of someone, then -- and sending it in to thelab, et cetera, there's multiplecomponents.
One is you've got to test the right person at the right time.
If you test someone too early, you may not actually get a positive sample, you may have toretest.
The methodology and how well youswab that sample may come into play as well.
There's clinical judgment whether someone needs to be tested in the first place.
It depends on the circumstances.
But the actual p. C.r. Test is very specific and it's quite sensitive.



Thank you, doctor.

---

**Question**:

To follow up on thetesting, how confident are you on the numbers, especially in Ontario we're hearing of rationing of tests, long waits to get results.
We're hearing the I. C.u. Numbersmay be underreported.
Does it concern you that ontariois testing people at a much lower rate per 1, 000 people thanother provinces?



**Answer**:

So I think the collective public health goal is to increase testing for sure.
So we are doing everything that we can right now to increase the capacity of testing in Canada.
For sure, though, if you actually looked at the numbers of people tested per capital, Canada is one of the highest percapita testing countries in the world.
But we can do better and we need to be supporting jurisdictions to get being through any sort ofrate-limiting steps.
We are looking at everything in terms of upping the capacities of provincial labs, but also these new diagnostics that have been mentioned by Minister hajduand others.
We are currently at the n. M.l. Looking at these new testing methods to see if they can be validated and if they are accurate and perform well, we are going to be providing those.
I know authorities in Ontario are trying very hard for sure toprovide those tests.
What I do know is that hospitalized patients are prioritized for sure.
You're going to be testing patients in I. C.u., hospital patients, healthcare workers, long-term care facilities, all of those much-higher-risk situations.
Provinces know that they are prioritizing all of those options.

---

**Question**:

Just to clarify, how to northern and first nations communities ask for assistance? and also, is the armed forces prepared to help neighbourhoods such as what we're seeing in quÉbec right now with quarantines?



**Answer**:

We're able to provide direct support into northern communities and we have a very good process in place.
Over the previous years, we've been responding to floods and fires and evacuation for certaincommunities, but the Canadian armed forces are there to respond to any emergencies and we have contingencies in place.
We have a good process in place.
We have Canadian armed forces leadership in those communities, especially through our Canadian rangers.
Through the territories, we're able to have an ongoing dialogue with the -- with public safety and the Canadian armed forces.
This is not done in a sequence.
This is done all at once so we have a good understanding early on what the needs are so we can get ready to respond with the right resources.
If the Canadian armed forces areneeded, we can respond.

---

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] --



**Answer**:

When it comes to quarantine, we have to be mindful that the Canadian armed forces is part of the wider government resource.
When it comes to quarantine, we have to take a look at it based on the right expert health advice and the right officials.
The decisions will be made on what's actually required.
Yes, we can provide support, but we want to make sure that we're providing the right support.
Right across the country it could vary on various things that we could provide, whether quarantine, logistical support, medical support.
That's going to be based on each unique need that's there.
We're going to make sure that our commanders on the ground have that flexibility to be able to respond quickly as well.

---

**Question**:

Minister sajjan or general Vance.
I'm wondering how do we know we have enough troops to handle this situation? it's not something we've done before.
How confident are you that we can respond at this time?



**Answer**:

When it comes to historically, the Canadian armed forces have always been there at time of need.
I can assure you that this -- even this is an unprecedented time.
We haven't been in this type of crisis before, but the Canadian armed forces, with the whole-of-government approach, will be able to respond to this.
Because one, the front-end healthcare workers to first responders from police, fire, paramedics, the canadian armed forces have always worked together on various other challenges.
This is no different.
We will put the support and we have the right resources and leadership to plan for the long term.

**Question**:

Because the world still goes on, how are we still able to continue with our international commitments while all this other stuff is happening?



**Answer**:

It's a good question.
Keep in mind, the rest of the world is also dealing with a COVID-19 environment.
I've been in touch with My counterparts across the world and I have a number of phone calls today as well.
We're learning from one another and looking at the current missions that we have, whether it's the work that we do at NATO, in the Ukraine, in the middle east.
We're making minor adjustments because of the COVID-19 environment.
The capacity-building that we used to do is not happening because in certain areas like ukraine, we can't do capacity building for this reason.
We're making sure that the forceis protected as well.
and we're also very mindful thatwe're looking at any adversariesthat might take advantage of thesituation.
We're very mindful of that and we're taking the right measures.
This is what -- when you've beenoperating in a very close multi-lateral environment, something that the Prime Minister has emphasized greatly, and through those relationships we're able to deal with these various threats.



We'll turn to the phone for three last questions.
Operator.



Thank you.
 [voice of interpreter] the next question is from Le devoir." the floor is yours.

**Question**:

My question is for you, madam Freeland.
I would like to come back to last Friday's press conference.
You talked about this possibility that the United States might deport refugees that we would have sent back to them since the border is closed to immigrants.
So I was wondering if you could give us an update as to the urgent discussions that you referred to. So do you have an update in relation to those discussions? did you obtain guarantees from the Americans relating to that? in terms of refugees who have been sent back to the United States as of the 20th of March, how many of them have gone back to their countries of origin?



**Answer**:

Thank you very much for your question.
As I said on Friday last, it is an issue that is of tremendous concern to Canada.
Myself and Minister Blair and our ambassador in Washington have all had conversations relating to that issue and the discussions are ongoing.

---

**Question**:

So I understand that it's not settled, but are you aware of cases where people were really sent back to the United States and then were subsequently deported or is this theoretical concern?



**Answer**:

This is one of the questions that we're asking right now.



Next question.
[end of translation].



The next question is from Jorge Barrera from CBC.

**Question**:

Minister Freeland, there's been some first nations leaders, particularly in the southern chiefs organization in Manitoba, who would like to see human doctors come in to help deal with the potential outbreaks in their communities.
I'm just wondering how your government feels about this request.



**Answer**:

Our government has every confidence in the excellence of the Canadian medical system, in the excellence of Canadian healthcare workers.
People have been hearing over the past few days a lot from Marc miller, the Minister charged with indigenous services, and he has been emphasizing the extent to which the government is aware of the particular vulnerabilities indigenous communities face.
So I have huge faith and trust in Canadian front line medical workers.
They are doing a great job and they're going to continue to do that.
I wonder if Dr. Tam wants to say any more about our medical workers.



So I've certainly worked very closely with the chief medical officer of indigenous services Canada.
If there are any requests or needs, there are mechanisms in place.
We also have mechanisms for mutual aid between different jurisdictions.
Should that be required, that can also be channelled through the public health agency of Canada.



Thank you, doctor.
Follow-up.

---

**Question**:

What I'm hearing is through the mutual aid it is possible to bring in Cuban doctors if particular first nations want that help.
There is reports of doctors being pulled out to deal with other regions.
I'm wondering if this is a possibility on the table right now?



**Answer**:

Let me just say and be very clear that we are very confident that Canada's healthcare system, which is staffed by outstanding healthcare professionals, has the capacity to deal with this extraordinary challenge.
Our job as a government is to work very hard to provide our healthcare system with all of the resources it needs to take care of Canadians, indigenous and non-indigenous.
We are very aware of the particular challenges vulnerablecommunities face.



Thank you, Minister.
Next question on the phone.



Thank you.
The next question is from emiliebergeron.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] yes, hello.
I'd like to know about the possibility of relying on the emergencies act.
Several weeks have gone by where one is studying that, and I wonder where one's thoughts are in terms of using the emergencies act or not.



**Answer**:

As the prime minister said the other day, there is absolutely nothing that is excluded or off the table at this point, but it's not on the table at this point.
There are discussions on a daily basis with the various provinces, and we are confident that the provinces through the tools and the municipalities are carrying out their work.
I must underscore the excellent work that's being done in quÉbec.
So it's a tool that's part of the toolbox, but it's not something that we're looking at right now.

---

**Question**:

Thank you.
When we talk about the possible intervention of the armed forces, is there an order firefighter priority that's beenestablished? for instance, intervene in one province first relative to another? [end of translation].



**Answer**:

No, there is no priority set.
This will be based on the needs on the ground.
The assessments that will happen across the country.
We have a very good system in place, based on our previous experience, to triage the right requests and making sure the right support is provided.
Having said this, we also had to make sure that the plan that general Vance has put together for the Canadian armed forces allows us to be very flexible to be able to respond to multiple areas if needed.
Being able to respond to communities, while ailment being able to respond to floods and fires if need be, and at the same time being able to respond to northern communities and isolated communities if required.
There is no priority per SE, bu twill be based on the expert advice from our officials.



That's it for today.
Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is our daily federal briefing from cabinet ministers and public health officials.
One of the messages that we hadn't heard yet was the involvement of Canada's military inside of the pandemic.
We had seen memos and reports on how they were preparing.
We got more details on that today.
Let me bring in My colleague the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and David Cochrane.
I'll start with you, Vassy.
Up to 24, 000 regular and reserve forces prepared to help if needed.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, as described by the defence Minister, harjit sajjan, Rosie, he basically tasked the chief of the defence staff, general Vance, to come up with a plan.
It sounds like what that includes, you're right, 24, 000 either regular or reserve force members at the ready.
That will depend on -- "at the ready," what I mean is that will depend on the need.
What the Prime Minister outlined and Minister sajjan reiterated, no province has asked for help, but they are ready to assist.
I will go over the three areas they could become involved in. The first is preventing the spread of COVID-19. He specified people who could help in engineering or medical supplies, people who have specialties in the army that could be lent out to support in those tasks.
Also to support provinces and municipalities if there is a need for mitigation, for example, to help with communities that might need the help, then that will be part of the task as well.
The third is to assist vulnerable communities.
I heard the Minister specify the north and the arctic as potential for that.
We know, for example, a number of indigenous communities in the north are very, very understaffed when it comes to medical staff and lots of supply issues as well up there.
So you have to wonder if there is going to be a need for the military in that capacity as well.
Not a lot of details about how the process will work exactly, but I think the message today seemed to be, okay, we have this plan ready.
If we need to, we can respond if we are called.
The other thing I would highlight that they pointed out is that if there are floods, which that's the season we're in right now in a number of parts of the country, including where we are, if there are forest fires, a plan is in place that the military will still be able to respond to that and help in those efforts as we saw last year in both instances with fires and floods, while still being able to lend themselves to where the needs are to combat the spread of COVID-19. That was the overarching theme behind today.
We will have to see the threshold to which the military is applied, but this was the broad strokes of it.



**Rosemary**:

It's interesting that general Vance said troops had been sequestered to keep them healthy.
I only have a minute and a half left, David.
If you want to wrap-up on the wage subsidy question.



**David**:

The wage subsidy is the biggest economic response the government has had to COVID-19. If your revenue drops by 30%, you qualify for a wage subsidy up to 75% per employee retroactive to March 15. There will be post-payment compliance measures.
If you're found to have not needed this or had the revenue drop as severe a benchmark, there will be a repayment option.
If you're ripping off the government, there will be serious consequences.
It applies to small, medium, large, not-for-profits, and charities.
They are putting a financial floor under everybody so the minute this passes we can go back to life and start the economic recovery they are hoping will be there.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, David, and Vassy.
You can check Vassy on her show, "power & politics" and David will be on "the national." a reminder, as of noon today, an hour ago, if you're trying to get on a plain or a train with symptoms of COVID-19, you will be prevented from doing that.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Stay with CBC news network for up to the minute information and updates some provincial leaders will bring you all the latest and the health officials who are working hard to control the pandemic.
I'll see you back here tomorrow.
Thanks for watching.
Take care.
