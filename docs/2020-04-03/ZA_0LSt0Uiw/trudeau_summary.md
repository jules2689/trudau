### Summary:


To fight COVID-19, we are asking everyone to stay home as much aspossible, but these recommendations have had the effect of slowing down business activity.
Some are even had to shut down and that's concerning not only for business people, but for your employees who need their paycheque in order to meet theirneeds.
We therefore introduced a plan in three points to protect jobs and people who have been laid off, as well as supporting businesses who are having problems with cash flow.
We, therefore, announced a wage subsidy last week to encourage employers to keep their employees on payroll.


[end of translation] we announced that the government would subsidize up to 70% of wages for qualifying businesses. In some cases, you've had to make the difficult decision of letting your employees go. For people to get through this tough time and for the economy to rebound, people have to keep their jobs.
The number of employees you have will not determine whether or not you get this support.
This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a businessthat employees 10 people or 1, 000 people.
So here's what this means for workers.
If you work for a company that has been impacted by COVID-19, the government will cover up to 75% of your salary on the first $58, 700 that you earn. This subsidy will make a real difference in your lives and help everyone affected, bridge to better times.
In qu√âbec it's going to help trucking and logistics company stay in business so they can move essentials like food and toilet paper.
Minister morneau and Minister ngare working hard to get the background documents explaining the technical details of this measure.
On that note, I want to thank the public service who is working around-the-clock to get this done.
 

[voice of interpreter] businesses that show that their revenues have gone down by at least 30% will be eligible for the wage subsidyannounced last week.
We want people to be able to be paid whether they're working fora business that has 10 employeesor 1, 000 employees.

In that regard, I want to thank the entire public service that is working 24/7 to finalize the documents and information on this.
Every business of every size is having to make some difficult decisions because of COVID-19, and that's why the number of employees is not the eligibilitycriteria we've chosen.
We are in this together and that's why our government is stepping up to help all employers keep their employees.

Every dollar of this should go to workers.
You should make every effort to top-up their wages and every effort to hire back those workers who have been laid off in the past two weeks because ofcovid-19. That's why we set up a comprehensive three-point plan to support everyone across the economy, weather the storm, and come roaring back.

[voice of interpreter] for the time being, the federal government has received no request from the provinces to have the army respond, but if that were to change, the canadian armed forces would be prepared to answer the call as they have done throughout our history, whether to bring medical equipment to those who need it or to help out with forest firesor flooding, our men and women in uniform are always there for you.
