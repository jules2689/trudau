**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'm wondering with the wage subsidy do you have an estimate right now as to what that will cost the treasury, what the overall cost of that will be?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We have been making changes to what we've been doing over the past days and weeks.
These costs keep climbing, but Icahn assure people that our focus right now is on making sure thatcanadians keep their jobs, even if they're not working on them right now and keep their pay cheques rolling in, that people who lose their jobs get the Canada emergency response benefit to help them get through this difficult time.
and that there is credit to access for companies and businesses who need to bridge through in the coming weeks.
Our focus is on making sure thatcanadians are safe now and that our economy can bounce back strongly after this time of slowdown, of stoppage, is done.
Fortunately, Canada has taken responsible decisions over the past many years to have one of the best balance sheets in the g7. We have been making sure that we have money aside for a rainy day.
Well, it's raining, and we are now able to invest in Canadians, to support Canadians, as we make the difficult decisions needed to get through this and to come back stronger than ever before.

**Question**:

But do you even have a ballpark estimate, is this going to be in the tens of billions or hundreds of billions?



**Answer**:

The finance Minister will be addressing Canadians tomorrow with many more details, including detailed costings and expectations.
Right now our focus is on creating a program that is going to help Canadians keep their jobs, stay in their jobs, even if they're staying at home so we can all do the things we need todo to keep ourselves safe, to keep our families safe, to keep our health workers safe, and to keep all Canadians safe.
We will get through this.
That's what this is about.
 [voice of interpreter] right now, we are focused on coming through this difficult situation and in order to do that, we need Canadians to stay home and follow the recommendations in order to follow the situation.
We know this is very difficult for businesses and entrepreneur sand that's why we are providing them a wage subsidy so that they can keep their employees on the payroll during this difficult time so that we can come back and recover quickly at the end of this.
That is our priority.
For more details, the Minister of finance and the Minister of small business will be available tomorrow to answer questions.
But the important thing is to reassure employers and workers right across the country that we will be there for them.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Prime Minister.
I understand the details will becoming, but when will this subsidy be paid to employees?



**Answer**:

Right now we are working to finalize those details as quickly as possible.
For C.R.A. it's about ensuring that the emergency response benefit can get to people as quickly as possible.
But I can also say now to entrepreneurs and business people and business owners that this help will be getting to them soon.
They will be able to re-hire their employees.
They should ensure that they will get paid through the credit facility that we made available because the government will be there to provide a wage subsidy of up to 75% if you're affected by COVID-19. So we are working very hard to get that money out the door in the next few weeks.
In the meantime, you have access to credit which will allow you to move forward.
Know that the government will be there to help you and to help your employees.

**Question**:

On another topic, the United States provided some very striking figures about what is there.
I would like to know about some scenarios.
Do you think Canada is following the United States trajectory at this time?



**Answer**:

Well, I think I would say we're not necessarily on the same trajectory.
We are quicker to get the screening done and I think we would have more success in getting people to self-isolate.
But at the same time we will seewhat the clear situation is in the next week or two based on what people are doing in the last week and then we will know whether that is bearing fruit.
Everything is based on the decisions people have made and continue to make.
I am proud of the way Canadians have rallied and continue to abide by the guidelines.
and I think they understand we all have an opportunity to have a direct impact on Canada's ability to come out of this.
I'm very proud today to be canadian.

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Now, the trans mountain construction work is continuing.
It allow belongs to the federal government.
There are some indigenous communities who are worried about the health of those workers.
I'm wondering as owner of t. M.x. Why you don't stop that construction work.



**Answer**:

That's a good question.
a number of decisions are being taken right across the country about whether some workers are essential or not or whether certain types of work should continue or not.
I will be following up on that to give you a better answer tomorrow.

---

**Question**:

and since you don'tseem to have the answer now, I would like to know with respect to today's announcement, you say there will be serious consequences for businesses that take advantage of the subsidy.
Why do you feel the need to warnpeople? do you believe that there is a risk that this will be like an open bar that people will exploit?



**Answer**:

No, I don't think it will be a program that will be easily exploited.
We have developed parameters for companies in terms of keeping people on the payroll or bringing them back in if they were laid off.
But we do understand when the priority is to give help to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, you do have to act quickly and trust is required in those circumstances.
You have to trust people to do the right thing and not take advantage of the situation.
But I want to ensure everyone we will have the measures and systems in place in the weeks to come to ensure that there is no abuse.
I can tell you that if there is abuse, there will be severe consequences for anyone who tries to take advantage of the system and, therefore, take advantage of Canadians during this difficult time.

The next question Brian lily Toronto sun." your line is open.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, I'mwondering with the economic hardship that so many Canadians are facing even once this wage subsidy kicks in, have you or other M.P.s thought of foregoingyour raise that kicks in on April 1 or pausing the carbon tax that is set to go up by 50% on April 1?



**Answer**:

The price on pollution has been designed as to put more money in households' pockets, more money in the pockets of the middle class, while we're doing what is necessary to fight pollution and protect our planet.
That is something we are going to continue to do because we know we need to do things to make sure we're both supporting families through ordinary times and through difficult times and moving forward on continuing the fight against climate change, which remains even at a time of immediate crisis and pandemic.
In regards to salaries, I haven't heard the parliament of Canada having those discussions, but I'm sure they will reflect on it now that you've asked the question.
 [voice of interpreter] with respect to a price on pollution, we introduced that program in order to give more money to families and more money to the middle class than what it would cost them because we know it's important to support families, while at the same time fighting climate change.
We will continue to move forward with our climate change plan.

**Question**:

The travel screening measures that you talked about on Saturday, you had previously dismissed those for international flights.
You dismissed calls for banning travel earlier on, even just less than two weeks before you eventually did.
At that point, most of the cases of COVID-19 were travellers coming into Canada.
Now it's 63% community spread.
Do you regret not acting sooner on travel restrictions at airports for flights from international hot spots?



**Answer**:

I think there's going to be lots of analyses around what happened when.
Our focus every step of the way was doing what was necessary every moment based on the recommendations of experts, based on science, and doing what we can to keep Canadians safe.
We're obviously not in an unprecedented situation.
We're not always going to get things perfectly right, but we're going to continue to be committed to doing things the best we can and figuring out what works and what doesn't and moving forward in a way that is nimble and focused on helping Canadians insomuch as a government can be nimble and agile.
I think we've demonstrated we'regoing to stay focused on Canadians and doing the right things and that's what we'll do.

**Question**:

Julie van dusen, CBC.
How can you get an accurate picture of COVID-19 without a lot more testing, especially those working in essential services who may be out there without symptoms and spreading the virus and not even knowing it?



**Answer**:

Over the past few weeks we've been ramping up our testing capacities and that continues, both with more tests, better tests, different kinds oftests, with tests that return results more quickly.
These are things that are an essential part of managing the spread of the disease and indeed reducing the spread of this disease.
We will continue to ramp up our testing efforts, but at the same time the measures around self-isolation that have been put in place are also going to be extremely effective for keeping people at home.
If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate.
Take measures to not spread.
Whether or not you get a test back immediately or tested rightaway, you can take measures through self-isolating yourself that will prevent the spread.
As we move forward, we will get more and more measures to test more accurately, test more rapidly, get those results back, and keep Canadians safe.
Right now these self-isolation measures are an extremely important thing while we ramp upour testing capacities.
 [voice of interpreter] we understand that massive screening is important in order to come through this, and that's why every day and every week we have been substantially increasing our testing capacity and the number of tests that are carried out.
Those numbers continue to go up because we need to manage that crisis in the next weeks and months with a lot more testing, as other countries have done.
But for the time being, and that's why self-isolation is so important, if you don't feel well or if you have symptoms, it's very important that you self-isolate and not wait for a positive result to take this action.
You have to self-isolate immediately to protect your family and community and preventthe spread of the virus.

**Question**:

Where do you stand on the energy sector and will there be help for the energy sector.
and with Canadian oil opening up at less than $5 a barrel, will there be help for the energy sector and, if so, when?



**Answer**:

First of all, the wage subsidy we helped will help companies large and small across all sectors of the economy.
That will go a long way to ensuring workers and employers that they will get through the coming weeks.
There are certain industries that have been extremely hard hit by both the drop in oil prices and the COVID-19 challenge, whether airlines, oil and gas, tourism.
There are areas we will have to do more, and as I said from the very beginning, we will be doingmore.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize what we did with the wage subsidy announcement will help many employees across the country that will be affected by COVID-19, but there are also particular industries that will be more hard hit than others.
For example, the airline industry, the oil industry, the tourism sector.
There we will need to do more and we're looking at how we can do that.

**Question**:

Why isn't the federal government releasing their modelling numbers? in addition, what about predictions there could be a second and third wave? if you could answer in french, please.
Thank you.



**Answer**:

We will continue to release the information we have in as accurate as -- a way as possible to see where we're going and how we're doing.
We recognize what's going to happen in a few weeks or a month and months from now depends on how people are behaving today.
With the built-in lag in COVID-19 of two weeks, with the delays of getting test results and from getting results from provinces, we know that there's not always an accurate picture today of what's happening today.
That's why we're going to keep modelling the different scenarios that could happen and continue to emphasize to Canadians how important it is that they abide by the rules andrecommendations and guidelines set forth by public health agency of Canada.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that it's important for people to have information about how we will continue to fight COVID-19 and what is happening.
We will continue to share information as it comes.
It's important to realize we have models that will predict what will happen based on people's behaviour today and we will continue to look at a rangeof scenarios and keep Canadians informed about what is happeningas much as possible.

**Question**:

Today new screening measures are coming in place for airlines and trains.
I'm wondering, many of these people who are conducting these tests to screen passengers for COVID-19 are not medical professionals.
How are they expected to adequately do their job and what type of training and protective equipment will these people have?



**Answer**:

The fundamental principle we have put forward is if you have symptoms of COVID-19, if you feel you might have symptoms of COVID-19, stay home, self-isolate, don't go outside, don't travel.
That is what we're asking of allcanadians.
These measures we've brought in for airlines and railways is an additional measure, an additional encouragement and expectation that people who havesymptoms of a cold or of COVID-19 will not travel.
That is extremely important, andit's something that, like so many of these measures we put inplace, is going to rely on people stepping up, doing what is right, and not travelling if they have symptoms of COVID-19.

**Question**:

Last week the business loan of -- excuse me, from the bank of Canada -- many pubs and bars and cannabis industry businesses are wondering why they don't qualify for that extended line of credit.



**Answer**:

What we are putting forth is loans for businesses who have had to or are about to layoff their workers.
Now they can keep their workers on the payroll at 75% or more if they can top it up of their salaries, so that when we are through this, they can pick up again where we left off and get our economy roaring back.
That is our focus now.
In terms of access to credit, there are many mechanisms out there for businesses of all different sizes to access credit.
For small businesses, there is the $40, 000 loan, of which $10, 000 will not have to be repaid if they meet certain conditions.
There are many things we're doing out there with low-interest or no-interest loans to help businesses get through this.
But the wage subsidy and the emergency response benefit for those who lose their jobs will be there to make sure we come through this strongly.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] I'd like to come back to the Canadian armed forces.
In some cases they are using the army to use or produce medical equipment.
You mentioned a couple of scenarios, but I would like to know exactly why we might need the army and under what medical scenario they could be helpful.



**Answer**:

The Minister of defence will be at a press conference later and can give you details on that.
But I can tell you the Canadian armed forces have always been there to help Canadians and communities in difficulty, whether it was because of flooding or other emergencies.
We know that there are some scenarios under which they could help and we know that the army could do a large number of things.
We will ask for help to work with the provinces and territories if there is a request, but the point is they're there if we need them.

---

**Question**:

Now, you say people will receive severe penalties if they abuse the system.
How will you know and how will you penalize them?



**Answer**:

Well, we'll be putting in place a system in the coming weeks to ensure that this wage subsidy does get to businesses and the money gets to those companies who truly need it. If there are companies or individuals who take advantage of the program, there will be severe consequences.
We're at a time when Canadians have to trust each other and be able to rely on each other.
People who take advantage of a crisis to put money in their own pockets will see stiff consequences on the part of our society, but also on the part of the government.
We'll more to say about that tomorrow.

**Question**:

It's nearly April 1and Canada's smallest businesses are wondering how to pay rent.
Their workers are covered by measures you've announced, but the business owners can't take on more debt, even interest-freeloans.
is rent really on the table for them?



**Answer**:

We know that a significant part of business expenses are around payroll and our focus is on supporting workers and supporting canadiansso they can stay home, so they can make sure we're doing the things we need to to get through this as quickly and as well as we possibly can.
Our focus right now is on this wage subsidy of 75% for employers who need it. That will give Canadian workers up to $847 a week, depending on what their salary is. These are measures that will make a huge difference in relief for businesses, in relief for workers, in ensuring our capacity to bounce back, to rush back strongly when this is all through.
That is our focus right now.
As I've said, these are measureswe're doing now.
We are always going to look at, are there more things we need todo.
Are there other ways we can and must help people get through this difficult time.
We will continue to work and listen to people to make sure we come through this as strong as possible and get out the other side as strongly as possible.
