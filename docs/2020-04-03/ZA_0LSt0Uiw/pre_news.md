Glad you're joining us. We are, as we have come to get used to, waiting to hear from the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, every time every day at this time.
We are waiting to hear more on the payroll subsidy.
We are also hearing today that the number of Canadians who have asked for employment insurance has gone up to more than 1.6 million people in the last nine to 10 days.
That is more applicants for employment insurance since stat scan began taking that data in more than 70 years or so ago.
That gives you a sense of the need Canadians have as the government tries to fight the pandemic from the public health perspective and stabilize the economy which is starting to melt down as people are laid off and forced to work from home.
We also know from a health perspective, Dr. Theresa tam, the chief public health officer in this country, telling us that this week is a critical week in terms of seeing whether Canadians' efforts of physical distancing are making a difference and whether we can flatten the curve.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos, the host of "power & politics" and David Cochrane.
Vassy, I'll start with you.
We know Monday had been the day the government promised to give more details about this small- and medium-sized business aid.



**Vassy**:

This is a few days into the original announcement.
a lot of small- and medium-sizedbusiness owners anxious to find out if they're going to qualify because those details have not been provided to the public.
My understanding is there will be a few details provided today, but the bulk of those details will be released tomorrow.
I think the primary questions onwhether or not people qualify includes things like do I have to be incorporated, can I be a partnership.
is there going to be a cap in the last iteration of this, the 10% wage subsidy, there was a cap per employer and employee.
The independent federation of businesses says that a cap wouldnot be helpful in this instance.
That would increase the cost of the program, but they're saying the cash needs to come quickly and there should not be an upperlimit for the employer, maybe the employee, but not the employer.
All those significant and important details have to come.
I'm not anticipating all of themwill come from the Prime Minister.
The bulk of them will come tomorrow.
We're anticipating to hear from the defence Minister later on as well as the chief of the defencestaff talking about the military's posture and positioning in all of this, and not so much that they're callingthe military in per se, there isalso forest fire season and flooding season coming up. We're expecting the details on that from general vance.
But I'm told the Prime Minister will mention the military in Canada's response to COVID-19 as well as all the other things going on.



**Rosemary**:

a few details therefor small- and medium-sized businesses, but not everything.
It is complicated and there are lots of details, but we will seehow quickly they can get that sorted out.
Just to give people an update ontesting in this country, more than 210, 000 tests have been completed across the country.
Of course testing so critical toinvestigating, isolating cases, tracing contacts so you can see what's happening inside communities.
I do have a graph following somereporting done by My colleague mike crawley around the I. C.u. Capacities.
He confirmed that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases now account for one in four patients in Ontario.
Now, there's still capacity in the hospitals, but it does show a couple of things.
First of all, it shows that Ontario, as you can see on your screen there, is testing a smaller proportion of its population versus the other provinces, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta.
That might be troubling, given that we are expecting this week to be so critical for that.
Let me bring in -- we're trying to get set up. I'll bring in david Cochrane andwe'll keep going on that front.
At noon today the government is putting stricter measures arounddomestic travel, either by rail or air.



**David**:

Yeah, they're asking airlines and passenger train companies to do a screening of their passengers, asking them --whether they're symptomatic or anything like that, and if they are, they are going to be refused entry to the plane or the train.
This is a critical week in what the data will tell us. This is what Dr. Theresa tam, the chief public health officer for the country told us. When we get the lag of snowbird sand spring breakers that are coming back to Canada, and also we're going to get a sense of how well the physical distancing and lock down measures that were implementing around the same time that people were coming back may have done to slow or flatten the number of cases.
The entire objective of all of these measures is to flatten thecurve.
I suspect there will be some concern that the return of nearly 1 million Canadians out of the country back to Canada, coinciding with the economic lock down of things we have seen could have a little bit of a problem or they could collide with each other.
There is some concern that could show up in the numbers.
It's going to be a critical week getting an idea of where Canada is on these things because of the two timelines that we're working with on extreme physical distancing and the return of people.
Just coming back to today's announcement.
The wage subsidy is extremely important for small businesses that want to stay in operation throughout this, whether your local corner store, pharmacy, grocery store.
Not the big chains like loblaws, but smaller places.
Some of them it could mean the difference between staying open or going under.
and the best description I heard with what's going on with the Canadian economy outside of the oil sector came from a Carlton professor saying essentially thecanadian and the world economy is in a medically induced coma.
It's been put under to stop the spread of additional harm.
The measures we're doing now are meant to sustain it through this period and help it come back to full strength once the coma period is over.



**Rosemary**:

That's a good seguethere.
Apologies for the technical issues.
It was that I couldn't hear anything.
We're waiting for the Prime Minister in about seven minutes or so. Let me bring in a guest and that is David McMillan, a restaurant owner of Joe beefs, a very chef and restaurant other than in Montreal.
Good to see you.



**Interview**:

Thank you.
How are you?



**Rosemary**:

I'm good.
I wanted to get you on because of some stark numbers on your Instagram and that is because 700, 000 people in the restaurant and hospitality industry lost their jobs in the last couple ofweeks.
How are you doing?



**Interview**:

I'm doing good.
There's about 1.2 million working in the restaurant industry, arguably more.
Last week 700, 000 people got their walking papers.
So we're looking forward to dealing with issues related to this, making sure everyone is good.
We have to look at the trickle-down effect.
We're talking about restaurant workers, but restaurants work with all kinds of community manyof based organizations, small farms, cheese, wine makers, the whole gamut.



**Rosemary**:

Your restaurant has been around and it's successful.
is it hitting you differently than a smaller, newer restaurant?



**Interview**:

Absolutely.
Joe beef is 15 years old and does fairly well.
We have a little bit of a war chest, not much after 15 years.
We could weather a couple of months maybe, but I have friends messaging me who opened a week before this happened.
a grand opening and closing.
I have friends who have $300, 000in renovation fees who had to close five days after they re-opened from renovating.
There are a lot of people in hotwater.



**Rosemary**:

What about the wage subsidy that the Prime Minister and the government announced last week, 75% of wages for companies? I know you've had to layoff some of your people, but if you brought them back on the payroll, would that be enough to cover what they need? would that work for you?



**Interview**:

It may.
We still have to read the fine print.
My business partner is doing her due diligence today reading through this, today and tomorrow.
There is fine print.
We have to understand how exactly that works.
I can put everybody back on payroll if the government says so, but eventually four weeks from now I won't be able to makepayroll.
So we have to study all of that and all of the fine print very carefully.



**Rosemary**:

They also have put some loans in place.
I don't know whether that's something you do personally wit ha credit line.



**Interview**:

Yeah, sure, but getting in debt during this is absolutely not our ideal scenario.
I don't want any loans to be honest.
I'd like utilities to calm down, I would like bell to step off, hydro qu√âbec and utilities to step off.
I'm going to write off a month here.
I might write off two months.
I expect everybody to write off down the chain two months for this to work.
We're going to see the true nature of big business coming soon.



**Rosemary**:

What worries you about the restaurant industry sort of across the country and in the United States? you hear some really sad stories about even big restaurants and big chefs having to close things.



**Interview**:

It's exactly just that.
The nature of our business is a very old, historical business of feeding people and restoring people in small rooms and groups.
Now we have to look at if the new reality is that we can't sit multiple people in dining rooms in close confines, we'll have to completely change the way that we practice our business.
It's very special.
I don't even see light at the end of the tunnel, to be honest, that I can sit 40 people in a 20foot by 20 foot dining room in the next eight weeks doesn't sound realistic to me. So we're going to have to take aha rd look internally at how we work and come up with solutions.



**Rosemary**:

Are you worried about your future and your business?



**Interview**:

Absolutely.
I've been doing this since I was17 years old.
I'm going to be 50 next year.
I've given My whole life to the restaurant business.
I love it. I enjoy it. Yeah, I can definitely see we'rejust haemorrhaging money.
There's nothing to -- it could be the end, you know.
But that's fine.
Chin up. I'll buy groceries.
I'll help out.
[ laughter ].



**Interview**:

I could cry about it. I had a good run.
Hopefully we can get back to it, stay positive.
I've had a wonderful career and a great run.
If that's it, so be it. I just make sure that My kids are happy and healthy and My loved ones are taken care of. Chin up.



**Rosemary**:

Are you -- I'll just end on this, and I like the expression "chin up." I use it a lot too.
There are so many people cooking at home and posting on instagramand Twitter.
Are you doing that and doing something that brings you hope and joy at home?



**Interview**:

Yeah, we're cooking family meals and overcooking and sharing foods.
Sharing with friends in the immediate quarantine circle.
Having a great time watching social media.
Lots of people are making sour dough bread.
Lots of pastas.
Lots of people sharing fancy wines they're drinking.
Social media is fun, lots of live Instagram videos.
It's neat.
We need a -- thank god for social media.
At least we have a connection with other people and see what they're up to.



**Rosemary**:

Listen, I hope it'snot the end for you and other restaurants across the country, but I wanted to highlight some of the stark numbers you put on Instagram, 700, 000 people losing their jobs in the last couple ofweeks.
Dave, thanks.
I hope I get back to eat your lobster spaghetti.



**Interview**:

Thanks.



**Rosemary**:

That was Dave McMillan, the owner of Joe beef.
As we wait for the Prime Minister, we will bring back Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
Vassy, I'll go to you.
You see Dave talking about keeping his chin up and trying to put a good face on, but there are already people contemplating two months down the road, I don't know if I can come back, idon't know what this looks like.
is there a big shift in many industries, but particularly the hospitality one?



**Vassy**:

Yeah, it does definitely depend on the industry.
I think anybody who runs their own business -- I come from a family of people who do -- is very much right now worried about staying open.
When you don't have the ability to draw revenue, to bring in anyrevenue, very quickly your reserves start to leave you.
I think that's why the potential for this wage subsidy, this increased 75% wage subsidy is hugely key.
I had a number of people reach out to me on Friday saying if the details are okay and I qualify, I can keep My employee son the payroll for the next two or three months if I have to. It is substantial.
and I think the important and the significant point we've been highlighting all morning and that our viewers need to know, we need some very clear signals from the government about who will qualify and will someone like the one you just spoke to, the owner of Joe beef, will they be able to qualify, will the owners of a salon qualify.
Not all businesses are run the same, some are incorporated or partnerships, some are not.
So I think those details are going to be hugely significant.
I think what the government has signalled so far is that it will be broad.
That's what they signal with thec.
R.b. As well.
The idea is to catch a big swathof people.
It will have to match up with the rhetoric and judge it based on that and see how many businesses qualify.
If the Prime Minister can come out and provide an overall cost of the program, that will give us an idea of how big a swath this aims to catch.
That is something I'm paying attention to and looking for from the Prime Minister when he speaks any moment now.



**Rosemary**:

I think it's fair to say that the government is trying to fire hose as much of businesses as they can.
It would be to their benefit and to the benefit of the economy to catch as many people as they can, as you point out there, Vassy.
I think the problem is, as we heard from Dave, as we head into the end of this month and into April, people are going to have to start not paying rents on their commercial leases and not paying bills and keep things going.
You can see that as you walk around neighbourhoods in this city and elsewhere, places beingshuttered.
It's not just the pressure of what is there, but the question of how quickly can they get it to people.



**Vassy**:

Exactly.
Cash is going to be king here, like it is normally, but the c. R.b. Going to the C.R.A. System, will the money be online or what form.
Those are the details that people who might be getting help through this really need to know.



**Rosemary**:

a reminder to people who think they might qualify for the Canadian emergency response benefit, the government says that portal will be open a week today, so that's April 6. The Prime Minister yesterday made a good suggestion for people concerned about that, that you go to the Canada revenue agency, go to My source, and open an account for yourself and choose direct deposit.
So that once the money starts flowing, you can get that as fast as possible.
That was the advice from the Prime Minister yesterday.
You will have to week a week to apply and wait 10 days to get the money.
If you're one of the 1.7 million people who have applied for employment insurance over the past five to 10 days, that's fine, that's in there.
If you applied for the emergency response benefit, you'll automatically get transferred into that.
I'll go back to David as we wait for the Prime Minister who is a couple minutes late.



**David**:

Yeah, I think there ISS more fundamental issue for small businesses.
Even if the wage subsidy is broad and vast, a lot of businesses aren't allowed to operate.
If you can operate and get a revenue stream going in and you can use this wage subsidy, that's helpful.
But if you're a small business or a toy store that's been closed because it's considered anon-essential business, you have to dip into cash reserves and savings to pay people.
That's why these benefits are soimportant.
If you're a small business ownerand you can't operate at all, like a daycare, you can furloughyour workers and they keep whatever wages they have, but then they get the c. R.b. From the federal government.
It's how these things work in concert that is going to help businesses and companies in the way they operate.
Dave mcmillan in joe beef has a peculiar situation.
They have no drive-thru window.
That is a nice sit-down restaurant.
They have the extra challenge that they're not allowed to operate in the way they normallyoperate.
a wage subsidy, unless they totally retool to become primarily takeout, which they could do, the wage subsidy is not going to be the solution.
Nobody is going to come out of this whole or completely intact.
The goal has to be to mitigate -- it's all about loss mitigation and damage mitigationto try to contain it as much as possible.
I thought the most telling thinghe said was we are going to see the true nature of big business coming soon, as far as calling rent in and mortgage and insurance and cancelling utilities.
We've seen that one-quarter of small businesses in this countrydon't have their April rent and mortgage.
As we're waiting for the aid packages, most of them have losttheir March revenue and prepaid those costs.
The economic contagion of this is really quite severe and really, like all of these thingsare designed to get us through this social distancing and physical distancing crisis period, there is going to be a larger conversation that has to happen in this country about therebuilding and restructuring of things once this is over in terms of provincial government finances, municipal government finances and small- and medium-sized businesses and the large-scale industries hit like airlines, tourism, and the oil patch.
The rebuilding, the physiotherapy part of this, backto medicine, that is going to bea significant and vastly important task the government has ahead of it.



**Rosemary**:

We got the two-minute warning.
I'm going to bring in Dr. Isaac bogoch.
He is an infectious disease specialist at toronto general hospital.
I have one question after hearing Dr. Tam about why this week is so important in terms ofgetting a sense of where we are at and how we're doing.



**Isaac Bogoch**:

We know we've --



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Bogoch, I'm sorry, the Prime Minister is early.
I'll come back to you.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
