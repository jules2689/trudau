**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:



[voice of interpreter] thank you for being here.
To fight COVID-19, we are asking everyone to stay home as much aspossible, but these recommendations have had the effect of slowing down business activity.
Some are even had to shut down and that's concerning not only for business people, but for your employees who need their paycheque in order to meet theirneeds.
We therefore introduced a plan in three points to protect jobs and people who have been laid off, as well as supporting businesses who are having problems with cash flow.
We know for many people their major concern is to ensure that they can continue to receive a salary.
We, therefore, announced a wage subsidy last week to encourage employers to keep their employees on payroll.


[end of translation] we announced that the government would subsidize up to 70% of wages for qualifying businesses.
We know what businesses are going through.
Over the past weeks, you've had to get creative to keep money coming in. In some cases, you've had to make the difficult decision of letting your employees go. For people to get through this tough time and for the economy to rebound, people have to keep their jobs.
So we announced the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
I said last week that we would have more details to share, and that's the first thing I want to talk with you about today.
If your business' revenues have decreased by at least 30% because of COVID-19, you will be eligible for this subsidy.
The number of employees you have will not determine whether or not you get this support.
It will apply to non-profit organizations and charities, as well as companies both big and small.
This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a businessthat employees 10 people or 1, 000 people.
So here's what this means for workers.
If you work for a company that has been impacted by COVID-19, the government will cover up to 75% of your salary on the first $58, 700 that you earn.
That means up to $847 a week.
As I mentioned on Friday, this will be backdated to March 15. This subsidy will make a real difference in your lives and help everyone affected, bridge to better times.
In qu√âbec it's going to help trucking and logistics company stay in business so they can move essentials like food and toilet paper.
In calgary it will give breathing room to the benge hairsalon that had to close.
Minister morneau and Minister ngare working hard to get the background documents explaining the technical details of this measure.
On that note, I want to thank the public service who is working around-the-clock to get this done.
 

[voice of interpreter] businesses that show that their revenues have gone down by at least 30% will be eligible for the wage subsidyannounced last week.
The number of employees will notdetermine your eligibility.
The subsidy will apply to non-profit organizations and charities, as well as to companies big and small.
We want people to be able to be paid whether they're working fora business that has 10 employeesor 1, 000 employees.
So if the business for which youwork has been impacted by COVID-19, the government Mr. COVER up to 75% of your salary on the first $58, 700 thatyou earn.
That means $847 per week -- up to $847 per week.
As I said last week, that subsidy will be retroactive to March 15. Ministers ng and morneau are working very hard to provide more details to companies as quickly as possible.
In that regard, I want to thank the entire public service that is working 24/7 to finalize the documents and information on this.


[end of translation] about you, about hard-working employees across the country.
It's about making sure you have money to buy groceries right nowand a job to come back to later, once we're through this.
Every business of every size is having to make some difficult decisions because of COVID-19, and that's why the number of employees is not the eligibilitycriteria we've chosen.
This is in line with best practices we've observed in other countries.
That said, I want to offer a word of caution to businesses.
We are trusting you to do the right thing.
If you have the means to pay theremaining 25% that's not coveredby the subsidy, please do so. and if you think this is a system you can take advantage ofor game, don't. There will be serious consequences for those who do. This unprecedented situation calls for unprecedented action.
It calls for good faith and trust between everyone involved.
We are in this together and that's why our government is stepping up to help all employers keep their employees.
For this to work, everyone has to do their part.
Every dollar of this should go to workers.
You should make every effort to top-up their wages and every effort to hire back those workers who have been laid off in the past two weeks because ofcovid-19. That's why we set up a comprehensive three-point plan to support everyone across the economy, weather the storm, and come roaring back.
With the Canada emergency wage subsidy, we're protecting jobs.
With the Canada emergency response benefit, we're helping those who lose their jobs.
and with the loans for businesses of all sizes, we're helping those who need it accesscredit.
 

[voice of interpreter] I would like to speak directly to businesses fora minute.
We trust you to do the right thing.
If you are able to pay the 25% that is not covered by the wage subsidy, please do. If you think that you can take advantage of the system, do not do that.
There will be serious consequences for anyone who tries to take advantage.
We are in an unprecedented situation and that means we have to take unprecedented action.
This crisis is calling on us allto act in good faith.
We are all in the same boat, andthat is why our government wantsto help all employers to keep their employees.
But in order for our strategy towork, everyone has to do his or her share.
Every dollar is intended for employees.
You must do everything you can to supplement their wages and rehire any workers who were laidoff in the last two weeks.
We have a plan, a three-point plan to help the economy to rebound.
For employers and employees, we have the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
If you lose your job or if you are self-employed, the new Canada emergency response benefit will be there for you.
and if you have problems with cash flow, we have announced a number of measures to help you.
and in addition, to give you more time to make your payments and pay what you need to pay, wehave postponed the payment untiljune the payment of duties on imports and g. S.t. Payments.


[end of translation] our top priority is to get you the help needed.
To do that our government is ready for every scenario.
Over the last couple of weeks, the canadian armed forces have been gearing up to support our efforts and communities as we fight COVID-19. Our men and women in uniform have always been there for Canadians in their time of need, and pandemic is no exception.
 

[voice of interpreter] for the time being, the federal government has received no request from the provinces to have the army respond, but if that were to change, the canadian armed forces would be prepared to answer the call as they have done throughout our history, whether to bring medical equipment to those who need it or to help out with forest firesor flooding, our men and women in uniform are always there for you.
They have a plan to support our communities during this difficult period.
At noon a number of ministers and the chief of the defence staff will hold a media briefingto say more about this.
We will also talk about emergency planning with the premiers of the provinces and territories at our next virtual meeting.
I want to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the canadian armed forces for their work and their service.
You are always ready to step up, and we very much appreciate everything you do for us. 

[end of translation] I know we're all looking forward to thedays when things are back to normal, but for that to happen, we need to keep taking the rightsteps today.
It means following public healthrecommendations.
You know the drill.
Stay home as much as possible.
Wash your hands often.
Keep at least 2 metres from eachother.
Our government will keep doing everything we can to make sure workers are getting paid and companies are supported.
The measures we've announced will help do just that and ensure that our economy is well positioned to recover from this.
We're going through a tough timeright now all together, but you know your government has your back.
and as always, if we need to do more, we will do more.
I want to close this morning by thanking all first responders across the country who are doingan incredible job for all Canadians.
Medical professionals, first responders, custodial staff, farmers, people who work along the supply chain.
Thank you.
Going to work right now is stressful and I know you're worried, but we're doing everything we can to keep you safe.
You are doing essential work andwe cannot thank you enough.
As always, Canada and Canadians will get through this by leaningon each other and everyone doingtheir part.
