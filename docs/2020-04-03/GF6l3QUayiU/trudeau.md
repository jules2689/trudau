**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Right now a lot of people are sitting around the kitchen table with bills and trying to figure out what needs to be paid and how to plan.
If you've been laid off, had your hours reduced or worried about your industry, these may be stressful.
Far too many Canadians are having these tough conversations about finances and their future.
Look at the numbers.
Last week, almost a million people applied for employment insurance.
The hard truth is that people are out of work because of this crisis and worried about what comes next.
So I want you to know that we'llbe there to help you.
Our government is doing everything we can to be there for you.




**Translator**:

Earlier this morning, the house of commons passed an emergency bill to help people as quickly as possible.
The bill is now before the senate.
I do hope that it's passage will be done quickly so we can help Canadians as soon as possible.
We will have more details about this later this week and further measures to announce.
and this is only the beginning.
But this new legislation will allow us to take the necessary measures to support you immediately.
We will be enhancing the Canada child benefit and delaying by three months the time to repay student loans.
and with this legislation, we are introducing the new Canada emergency response benefit.
This benefit will replace the two benefits we announced last week.
The emergency care benefit and the emergency support benefit, in order to simplify the process.
As I've been saying from the outset, as the situation evolves, we're adjusting our efforts to help you better.
The Canada emergency response benefit will provide $2, 000 a month for the next four months to workers who are not getting apaycheque because of COVID-19. So, if you've lost your job, or -- and you were working on a contract basis or were self-employed, this benefit willbe there for you.
If you're sick, or in quarantine, or if you're lookingafter someone who is infected, this benefit will be there for you.
If you have to remain at home without receiving a salary to look after your children or seniors, this benefit will be there for you.
and even if you still have a jobbut you're not receiving any salary because of the crisis, the new Canada emergency response benefit will be there for you.
There will be an online portal to put through applications.
It will be available very soon.
and people will start to receivemoney within 10 days of applying.
The Canada emergency response benefit will provide $2, 000 a month for the next four months for workers who lose their income as a result of COVID-19. This will replace the two benefits we announced last week, the emergency care benefit and the emergency support benefit, in order to streamline the process.
Like I said from the start, we will adapt our approach whereverneeded.
If you've lost your job because of COVID-19, whether you're full-time, contract or self-employed, this new benefit will be there for you.
If you're sick or quarantined, looking after someone sick or athome taking care of your kids, it's there for you.
Even if you're still employed but not receiving income becauseof this crisis, the CERB is there for you.
An application portal will launch as quickly as possible and people should receive money within 10 days of applying.
I know people are concerned about delays.
Families are worried about when they'll get help.
It can be hard to get through onthe line and that is frustrating.
Public servants are working around the clock while dealing with unprecedented demand and all of the same personal stress everyone else is facing.
They will get to your application.
Help is on the way.
In order to speed things up, we're rapidly deploying workers from different departments to deal with claims.
In the last 10 days, we've boosted the team by close to 13, 000 people to take your calls, process your claims, and get you the support you need.
and since last Monday, we've already processed 143, 000 employment insurance claims.
That means more money will go directly to people right across the country.
We're working to get you the support you need when you need it. and if you're doing okay, there is a way you can help someone else as an employer, a landlord or even just a friend, so you can be part of the solution.
It can make all the difference.
Because it's by working togetherthat we'll get through this.
and our team knows that.
We're collaborating with the provinces and territories as well as with first nations, inuit and metis nation communities to coordinate our efforts and ensure that everyoneis supported.
Earlier this week with the premiers we also discussed testing for COVID-19. We know that how long you wait for your results varies widely.
The premiers and I know we need to address that and we are.
This is something Minister hajduand I discussed with officials every day and will continue doing what is needed to speed upresults for everyone.
But I also want to recognize theincredible work medical professionals are doing on this front.
According to Dr. Tam, we've now tested about -- now testing about 10, 000 people a day.
That is a huge increase in numbers in a very short period of time.
and it's because people across the country are working tirelessly to make it happen.
At the same time we're helping companies, labs and scientific institutions produce and supply what we need most, from masks and ventilators to vaccines and anti-viral drugs.
We're collaborating with airlines to get Canadians home from abroad and instructing everyone they must isolate at home for 14 days.
We're also working with our international partners on this crisis.
This morning I had calls with the president of senegal and thepresident.
I've also spoken to Prime Minister of ethiopia and kenya about international coordination.
Tomorrow, I'll be speaking with other g20 leaders to discuss further global coordination to our response.

More than ever, it is essential that Canadians have access to the most recent information.
But like everyone the media are also feeling the consequences.
To ensure that journalists can continue to do their work, it is even more critical in the midst of a crisis.
and therefore, our government is announcing measures to support them.
The Minister will provide additional details later, but in the meantime I want to thank all journalists and our Canadian media who are keeping Canadians ware of the latest developments with facts and reliable information.
We very much appreciate your work.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Right now it's more important than ever that Canadians have access to the latest news and information.
To ensure that journalists can continue to do this vital work our government is announcing new measures to support them.
Minister guilbaut will have more to say about this shortly, but want to take a moment to thank our journalists and media for everything they do, today and every day.
Above all, the most important way we can work together is by staying apart.
Social distancing is our best tool to stop people from gettingsick.
I know people are seeing different graphs about how effective social distancing can be and new M.P. tracking the spread of this virus.
Every time you turn on the TV or go online, you probably read something new.
I know I do. and you'll want to know what is coming next.
Today I'll be getting the latest modelling from the public health agency of Canada and we'll discuss how to share this information even more directly with all of you.
But you deserve the best information we've got about what is happening today and what tomorrow might bring, because otherwise, the uncertainty can be really tough.
Not just for your routine, but for your mental health, too.
We're facing a once-in-a-generation challenge and on top of that, you can't domany of the things that keep youfeeling good, getting together with friends or having dinner with your neighbour.
If you need help, reach out to your neighbour, to a sibling, toa friend, a to a hot line, but do it from home.
Don't go out unless you absolutely have to. If you're already following these rules, thank you for doingyour part.
If you aren't, know that you're making a dangerous choice.
Because ignoring these rules puts every single one of us, yourself included, at risk.




**Translator**:

This is the reality.
If people refuse to follow the recommendations our doctors and nurses have more likelihood of contracting COVID-19. and if our health care professionals get sick, they cannot go to work and therefore they cannot take care of you if you get sick.
Our country is facing the greatest health care crisis in its history.
We cannot allow ourselves to put people at risk who take care of our health so instead of inviting people over for dinner, don't do it. That puts everyone at risk.
Grocers, technicians, bus drivers, farmers, people who collect our garbage, all of those people deserve better.
We must protect them.
It's not hard to do what we're asking to you do. Just stay home.
If you absolutely must go out, keep a two-metre distance between you and others.
If you're coming back from travel abroad, go directly home and stay there for at least 14 days.
That applies to everyone.
In order to come through this, we must all look after each other and we must all do our share.
I know that we can do this and iknow that Canadians are equal to the task.
Thank you.



Radio-Canada.
I'd like more clarity with respect to deadlines, April 6th is what Mr. Morneau is saying.
Now in terms of deploying this new benefit, what exactly will happen on April 6th? will there be an online platform? and under that scenario that means some people would not receive any help until the middle of April.
What are you going to say to people who need the help right away?



First of all, we're working hard in an unprecedented situation.
We understand that there is great pressure to get the help to people as soon as possible.
But we also know that there are many, many people who need to be helped in a very short time frame and we need to develop the systems that can quickly work for us as long as they're reliable.
and that is what the government is working on right now and we do hope to be able to put that system in place by April the 6thwith money coming in the following days.
We hope that it will be very quick and we hope to be able to get people applied for it well before that.
and that's what we're working on right now.
In terms of people who need helpnow, we know that some people are facing very stressful times.
They've stopped working, they'vebeen out of work for two weeks, they're not getting pay cheques coming in, so we'll do everything we can to help them.
With access to credit and other measures as necessary, we are here and listening to you, but will have to work very hard to together in order to come through this.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize this is an unprecedented situation with an overwhelming amount of demand bycanadians to get money as quickly as possible.
We need to make sure we're getting that money out quickly, but also reliably to Canadians and that means doing things that government hasn't done before and scaling up our processes extremely quickly.
We need to do that in a way that is going to be both reliable andquick.
and that's why we're pulling together people from across government to get this done.
We are hopeful that the system will be up and running by the Th of April, and that cheques or the direct deposits will be flowing days after that.
We recognize that is a ways off still and there are people who stopped working a week and a half go, two weeks ago, that are now receiving their last paycheque and not knowing when the next money is coming in. We recognize that.
We're looking for ways to help people bridge through credit or other measures their ability to make it to the arrival of the Canada emergency response benefit, but we'll continue to work diligently and rapidly to make sure we're helping every Canadian we can.



Prime Minister, with "the globe and mail". 60 business groups are calling on Canada for a wage subsidy.
They say it would be more efficient than the slow process you're rolling out right now.
You've been asked about this for several days.
The question is things are still on the table, but people are laying off workers now.
Now you seem to be saying that struggling businesses could choose to simply not pay their employees and the workers could receive payment under the new benefit.
is that what you're urging struggling businesses to do and why not go with the higher wage subsidies?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're absolutely looking at more direct help for businesses.
We recognize in an ideal situation businesses wouldn't have to lay off people and people wouldn't have to feel like they've lost their job and don't have a job to come back to after this crisis.
We're working with business groups.
We're working with small businesses.
Hearing their concerns.
Looking very carefully at the models put forward in other parts of the world like Denmark and Germany and others and looking at how we can make that work or make equivalent things work here in Canada.
We will have more to say on that in the coming days.




**Translator**:

We recognize in an ideal situation people would not be losing their jobs because of the situation, because of this crisis, and employers should not have to lay people off.
This is something we are trying to resolve with them.
We know that there are some models out there that are working in Denmark and Germany, and we would like to help people directly through this Canada emergency response benefit, but at the same time, we want to do things directly for businesses as well.
and we will have more to say about that in the coming days.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
CTV.
I know you just talked about direct support for businesses, but can you be more specific.
In the meantime, you said it will come out later this week.
There are businesses that have laid off people, there are people at home who cannot afford to pay their rent and the cheques are due soon.
What specific aid is available for people right now who are sitting at home who cannot afford their bills?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Businesses, we moved quickly to help them bridge through this time, help them get the liquidity they need at a time of crisis and significant slowdown in the economy.
For people at home, we recognize that loosening up rules around credit is also a possibility.
We've taken certain measures on that.
We know people are anxious.
We know that their final pay cheques from two weeks ago, last week, are starting to come in now and they don't know where the next one is coming in, or when the next one is coming.
That's why the Canada emergency response benefit is going to flow as a way of giving them $2, 000 every month for the next four months so that we can get through this together.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

Prime Minister, you are now in your 14th day of isolation, does that mean you are free now starting tomorrow? does your wife still have symptoms?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Thank you for that question.
Sophie feels much, much better.
and the children and I still do not have any symptoms.
We will continue to follow all the recommendations of our health care experts.
What does that mean? well that means that every day we follow those recommendations and if the situation changes we'll let you know.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, global news.
With more than a million Canadians returning from overseas, especially in hot spots like Europe and new York city, why are we relying on the honour system and not using the quarantine act to isolate them given we know that some people have boarded flights with symptoms just so desperate to get home?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

It is extremely important that everyone returning to Canada isolate themselves for 14 days.
This is a measure that will both keep them safe and prevent further spread of coronavirus through Canada.
This is something that we require of every single canadiancoming to this country.
We'll continue to tell people that.
We'll continue to highlight that.
We'll continue to require that of anyone coming into Canada that they isolate at home for 14days in order to protect everyone in the country.



**Reporter**:

How can you require it if it's not mandatory?



It is required for people to stay at home for 14 days.



**Reporter**:

But it's not mandatory.
Olivia stefanovich CBC news, we've learned that sick travelers are masking symptoms to get through airport screening.
Why does Canada not test temperatures, screen air passengers for fever, or use thermal screening at airports? should there be thermal screening and consequences for those who mask their symptoms?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize that there are many concerns about passengers returning to Canada, which is why we're asking people to immediately isolate as soon as they get home.
It is a requirement.
We also know that there are different countries using various technologies and we'll continue to lack at what is the -- look at what is the best way to keep Canadians safe.
There are a lot of discussion around thermal screening and taking temperatures and spot collection.
One of the lessons learned from SARS is that it is simply not as effective as -- not effective the way people would like it to be and can give a false sense ofassurance.
This is what the best medical advice and best science advice we're getting is, but we're always open to hearing stronger or different science that says -- or different recommendations that it, but we'll make sure how we choose to deploy our resources are the right way to help actually help Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Should there be testing and should the passengers returning to Canada, should there be consequences for those who mask their symptoms? and should they be forced to sign a document to make sure they self-isolate?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We know they need to isolate when they land in Canada.
They agree to an attestation on the processing when they arrive that they will self-isolate for 14 days.
That is an important thing.
and Canadians with symptoms willnot be allowed to board flights coming home.
That is a difficult measure I know for many people, many families, but we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep Canadians safe.



**Reporter**:

But some passengers are masking their switches, what are the -- symptoms, what the consequences?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We'll continue to do what is necessary and explaining to people in order to keep themselves safe and keep Canadians safe.



**Reporter**:
