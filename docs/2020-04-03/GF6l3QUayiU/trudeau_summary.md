### Summary:



Right now a lot of people are sitting around the kitchen table with bills and trying to figure out what needs to be paid and how to plan.
Last week, almost a million people applied for employment insurance.
The hard truth is that people are out of work because of this crisis and worried about what comes next.
Social distancing is our best tool to stop people from gettingsick.
I know people are seeing different graphs about how effective social distancing can be and new M.P.
Today I'll be getting the latest modelling from the public health agency of Canada and we'll discuss how to share this information even more directly with all of you.
We need to make sure we're getting that money out quickly, but also reliably to Canadians and that means doing things that government hasn't done before and scaling up our processes extremely quickly.
and that's why we're pulling together people from across government to get this done.
We recognize that is a ways off still and there are people who stopped working a week and a half go, two weeks ago, that are now receiving their last paycheque and not knowing when the next money is coming in.
We're looking for ways to help people bridge through credit or other measures their ability to make it to the arrival of the Canada emergency response benefit, but we'll continue to work diligently and rapidly to make sure we're helping every Canadian we can.
We recognize in an ideal situation businesses wouldn't have to lay off people and people wouldn't have to feel like they've lost their job and don't have a job to come back to after this crisis.
Looking very carefully at the models put forward in other parts of the world like Denmark and Germany and others and looking at how we can make that work or make equivalent things work here in Canada.
For people at home, we recognize that loosening up rules around credit is also a possibility.
We know people are anxious.
We know that their final pay cheques from two weeks ago, last week, are starting to come in now and they don't know where the next one is coming in, or when the next one is coming. well that means that every day we follow those recommendations and if the situation changes we'll let you know.
We'll continue to tell people that.
We'll continue to require that of anyone coming into Canada that they isolate at home for 14days in order to protect everyone in the country.



We recognize that there are many concerns about passengers returning to Canada, which is why we're asking people to immediately isolate as soon as they get home.
We also know that there are different countries using various technologies and we'll continue to lack at what is the -- look at what is the best way to keep Canadians safe.
One of the lessons learned from SARS is that it is simply not as effective as -- not effective the way people would like it to be and can give a false sense ofassurance.
This is what the best medical advice and best science advice we're getting is, but we're always open to hearing stronger or different science that says -- or different recommendations that it, but we'll make sure how we choose to deploy our resources are the right way to help actually help Canadians.



We know they need to isolate when they land in Canada.
That is a difficult measure I know for many people, many families, but we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep Canadians safe.



We'll continue to do what is necessary and explaining to people in order to keep themselves safe and keep Canadians safe.
