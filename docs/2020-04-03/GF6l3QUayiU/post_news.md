**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada wrapping up his daily briefing.
Expected to receive royal assent by the end of the day is this new combined measure that was announced last week under a new name, called the Canada emergency response benefit, which means that many, many, many Canadians who are currently unemployed or about to be unemployed or just don't have enough money to make ends meet for all sorts of reasons related to the pandemic will now have access to this.
Let me bring in My colleagues.
Vassy, as you had rightly informed us before the Prime Minister spoke, it is going to be $2, 000 a month.
What else did you take from that?



**Vassy**:

a couple of things I would flag.
Of course on what so many Canadians are watching for, that is the timing of the aid that is supposed to flow.
At first, the Prime Minister said especially where the new programme is concerned that the application portal, the page that you go to apply for this, would be open as quickly as possible.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I heard him saying it would be April Th and 10 days after that you would receive thepayments.
I think that's something we have to closely watch.
We was careful in his wording not to guarantee that the portal will be up April 6th.
and there is concern getting the application process.
For people watching, that is something to keep an eye on. The sooner the application process gets going, the better for them, but there no guarantees at this point.
and you and Catherine had talked about this.
It's hard to overstate how significant this is for businesses right now.
We have heard from so many organizations that represent in particular small businesses.
The fib said in the survey over the weekend, one-third of the businesses said they would not survive the month.
They're asking for comparable subsidies what we see in jurisdictions in europe.
70 to 80%. the Prime Minister gave more details than he has in the past on this, insofar as he said it'ssomething they're considering.
However, again, no time line attached.
He said that more to come in thecoming days.
The reason that I focus on the timing issue is because of that one-month window that so many businesses are looking at. Look, if you know anyone who runs a small business, you know that meeting payroll is hard in the best of times.
When you have zero revenue it becomes nearly impossible.
Subsidizing 10% of wages up to $25, 000 per employer, the consensus among the organizations that represent those business, is that is not enough.
The third thing, quickly, beforeyou head to catherine, the question around using the quarantine act.
This is something we've heard a lot as well, that people are -- not even anecdotally, you see states of emergency because people are not complying with that recommendation which is -- order depending where you live, when you come back from where you're you've been travelling, you have to self-isolate.
The Prime Minister was asked whyuse the honour system, why not invoke the quarantine act which My understanding would have a punishment or penalty.
He really avoided addressing whyhe wasn't going to use it or whether he would in the future and re-emphasized the message we've heard over and over again, this is what is expected of you.
But I do think he has framed this, you've got to listen to what I'm saying, this is My final warning.
Will there be a consequence? it's unclear.
I thought those were the big things to take away.



**Rosemary**:

I would point out when you come into the country, although this applies in provinces, when you come into the country, you do have a hit attestation on the customs machine that you go through, saying that you will self-isolate.
I would imagine you could go back and track people and enforce it if we got to that point, but it does seem -- dave seglins has been reported aroundpeople who are not being truthful about their symptoms and where they're coming from, although as the Prime Minister also said, when they did a vast postmortem on the sars, the temperature testing issue reallydidn't work as the Prime Minister points out.
So there has to be something that different than someone justtaking their word.
Catherine, I'll get you to weighin.
An angus reid poll in the last week shows a third of Canadians are very worried about not beingable to pay for their rent.
and don't have much money comingin.
The urgency that we're talking about here is a real thing for many people.



**Reporter**:

and there was one moment where he said something interesting, I don't think we'veheard from the Prime Minister, he said we're looking at ways to help people bridge through credit.
He didn't offer any explanation of what it is he's talking about, what that might look like.
I don't know that is exactly the kind of help that most canadiansare thinking of. They want to be eligible for these programmes.
But we got certainly a hint there from the Prime Minister as one of the options they're looking at, at least to help people get through until the aid he is talking about is delivered.
Possibly beyond that really, we don't know.
But one of many questions we're looking at. Another thing I would raise, you were talking about the screening of people coming back to Canada and I think to some extent there are two issues mixed together.
The reporting that Dave seglins did, the questions that the Prime Minister was asked, a lot had to do with people getting on airplanes in the first place.
Obviously, a lot of people are afraid and they know in some cases the window to get home is closing.
a lot of what the prime minister had to say was about self-isolating when you get back, but the government has said they've enlisted the help of Canada border services, the airlines, they're trying to check people before they come onthe planes themselves and then there is the question of what people do when they return to Canada.
That was a poignant moment when he was pressed by a reporter andsaid why not make it mandatory.
He said it's required, but of course, they're trying to encourage people to do this, butthere is not a measure that requires them to do it.



**Rosemary**:

There could be measures.
So it's sort of people saying, as Vassy said, you either do it or we're going to make you do it. I'm going to leave you for a moment, because speaking of people who wanted information about employment insurance, about additional benefits, let'sgo to rebecca Turk now.
She is self-employed.
Works in a salon.
She's concerned whether she'll be qualified for this.
How are you doing?



I'm doing well, thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

I don't know if you were able to hear the Prime Minister and whether any of that or anything we've said has clarified for you whether you'llbe able to get help.



Yes.
So actually that has provided a good amount of clarity.
I was quite concern because what I heard previously was for small business owners wage subsidies.
Being self-employed and working in a salon I'm sole proprietor, owner-operator, the only person.
So I don't pay a wage to anybodybut myself.
So 10% of My wage turns out to be very little.
It really is not enough to keep My business open after the quarantine and the pandemic endsor even subsidize part of My living expenses.
So I'm really glad to hear it's more available to self-employed Canadians in that way.



**Rosemary**:

It sure is. Yeah, you will qualify and the Prime Minister announces that you will get $2, 000 a month.
I would imagine that is not going to be enough, but you tell me how that will help you or not?



So, it will help keep me in My household, getting by in the meantime.
It's not a long-term solution truly for me. My concern is actually keeping My business open to have a business to come back to at the end of it. What that will do is keep a roofover My head and groceries in myfridge, but really the concern is the long-term, truly.
It's having something to come back to and covering the expenses I have.



**Rosemary**:

I understand your husband, too, he also has been affected by the pandemic and the economic consequences.
What can you tell me about him?



So he actually received a layoff prior to the quarantine due to economic downturn.
So he'd been on EU -- I want to say he applied a week before a lot of the shutdowns were in effect.
So he's been struggling with thee system, because one it's overloaded with plenty of people, and by the people starting the quarantine.
So really and truly is interaction with employment insurance at that time was scary.
It took a long time to get a lot of answers.
We still haven't received much information from and about his claim.
We're waiting hours on the phone to talk to anybody because, you know, I'm sure you can imagine people flooding the lines at this point really.



**Rosemary**:

and does that worryyou? the Prime Minister seems to say that this new portal, this new benefit, you'll be able to go in the beginning of April to sign up, you should get it 10 days later.
That's asking a lot, but he seems to think that is the time line.
is that fast enough? are you worried it won't be in your hands?



I'm very concerned about it not being in My hands fast enough.
I've already been out of work for almost three weeks.
I'm immune compromised at this point.
and also with My husband being on EU as well, being on a layoff, I'm really concerned we're going to be waiting five, six, seven weeks before we receive any kind of support.
Because I can imagine that receiving payment 10 days after application is quite optimistic with the amount of people that will be applying.



**Rosemary**:

If you could say something to the Prime Minister or the finance Minister about your situation, what other Canadians like you need urgent, what would you tell them?



Other Canadians like me, we need immediate support for entrepreneurs, truly, to keep their businesses, keep their jobs, keep them in the economy during this.
and also immediately some sort of immediate relief that requires no kind of application programme like a universal benefit.
So that we can subside and not be in this constant panic waiting for this relief to be released after everybody else has applied.
There needs to be some kind of universal -- some kind of universal programme that as a Canadian citizen you receive this amount just for being a Canadian citizen.



**Rosemary**:

How is your health? you said you were immune comprised?



I'm feeling well, healthy.
I'm nearly 20 weeks pregnant, soi'm keeping far away from everyone now.



**Rosemary**:

That's a good decision and congratulations.
I hope you got better information there.
I hope you get what you need there from the government and we appreciate hearing from you.
There is a lot of people out there like you right now.
So good thoughts to you and yourhusband.
Thanks, rebecca.
Let me go back to My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen as we wait for the press conference, the daily press conference from the COVID-19 cabinet committee.
I should tell you that the senate, I believe, is close to voting now on this legislation after which, of course, it will receive royal assent.
It is good to put faces -- I only have two minutes -- but it's good to be put faces to thestories.
a lot of people have been reaching out, which is one thing, but to talk to people howthey're affected and the very things we think people need to think about.
and that for rebecca was the time line here.



**Vassy**:

The time line is going to be so significant and I think also there are judging by the social media, a lot of questions coming from Canadians still about, I'm a student, I don't have any opportunity for work, do I qualify? the qualification questions are still significant.
I would urge them to continue watching as various ministers start speaking publicly and those questions will be posed tothem.



**Reporter**:

The government said again today, the Prime Minister said, this is only the beginning.
So the question is, what is going to come next? not only to help people like rebecca, but other people who aren't caught up by the programme but are caught by the outbreak.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
Vassy and Catherine, thank you for your help.
We'll be back to you.
So the big news today, as this legislation winds its way through the senate making its way into law by passage of royal assent this afternoon.
$82 billion financial aid package, but most importantly, this new Canada emergency response benefit which will givemany, many Canadians access to $2, 000 a month for 16-week period.
You can look for more information on the government website when it becomes available, which is one of the big questions.
How quickly can this money roll out? so many people waiting to pay.
I'm rosemary Barton.

Welcome back to our special coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic as we wait for our daily briefing from cabinet ministers and public health officials about announcements the Prime Minister made earlier today and the state of the pandemic in this country.
I'll bring in Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen right now just to give us a sense of what we might hear here.
I want to, if I can, get to a couple of people on the line who are stuck in Peru because this is, of course, the other part of the story, so many Canadians trying to get home desperately.
Vassy, what will you be wanting to hear more about?



**Vassy**:

a couple of things.
First, what you just brought up. I'm interested to see if there are updates on the specifics of the flights that we know are supposed to be coming from places like Peru.
I'm keen to see if there is a more specific timetable.
I know Canadians watching around the world are keen to if find those answers as well.
The second thing is on what we've been speaking about and that is the government's announcement they've combined the benefits into one stream.
a statistic that Prime Minister put out there just minutes ago think is worth flagging, when it comes to the idea of when will the money come, how fast can it get into the hands of people who need it now? he mentioned and already released this statistic, that 929, 000 people applied for ei. He said 1300 civil -- he said 13, 000, but he meant 1300, redirected to get claims processed.
I did some math, which rarely happens, but I did it and I had other people check it to make sure it was right because I'm often wrong, but that's about 15.4%. that's of regular EU claims in system that already exists.
Because the system is so overburdened by a number it's never seen before.
Keep that in mind, they're working tirelessly to get that money out, but even in the system that exists, they've only been able to process 15% of the applications.
Let's find out what kind of system is going to handle this other benefit.
What measures have they put in place or do they plan to put in place to try to alleviate that procedural stuff? and how fast do they expect the 10-day mark that the Prime Minister put out to be met?



**Rosemary**:

Even if you, as we talked to our friend rebecca, even if 2000 bucks is not enough, it will keep people with, as she said, a roof over her head and grocery, but you have to actually get it. You can't be waiting two or three weeks.
That is critical.



**Reporter**:

Certainly, those questions about the mechanics of how all this is going to work.
The Prime Minister is trying to be the reassure in chief, but there will be questions for the cabinet ministers about the mechanics itself.
How it's going to get done.
a lot of the focus is around financial measures, that's understandable, but there are outstanding questions about things like testing Canada.
Government officials say they want to see more testing done.
We see the numbers jumping up and yet there is still demand for a lot more of that.
We talk about the questions fromviewers, a lot of people are asking when are we going to see much greater levels of testing?



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
and we will probably get an update in the press conference shortly on that very issue.
I'm going to put you two on standby and go to Norma john andphillip, they're stranded in their rooms.
We have reached them in Peru.
Good to see you both.



Good morning.



**Rosemary**:

So it was a friend of yours, or maybe a son-in-law that reached out that said that you were both stuck there.
At this stage you do not have a government flight out.
and phillip, I believe you have underlying conditions.
So let me first ask you, phillip, have you heard anythingfrom the government about a flight for you?



My communications are handle din terms of -- because I am not in connection.



We have heard nothing about getting any of us out.
There was a flight that left yesterday and apparently there is another flight Thursday and Friday from Lima, but we are Norton those flights as far as we know.



**Rosemary**:

Norma, what are -- Phillip is your brother, what are your concerns about phillip's health and the need to get out of their quickly?



Yes, high blood sugar levels.
Exercise right now because -- [inaudible]-- room here.
Food every day which is fortunate for us. The food is also -- [inaudible]-- all this -- so I'm just concerned that we have more of Chance of getting the virus because obviously they're trying to contain it. Own homes and be self-isolated for however long it takes.
We don't care.
We just want, please, Prime Minister trudeau, please work ongetting those planes to all the other Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

So the connection is not great.
I will tell people, because I know? some of the history here.
I know that Phillip does suffer from diabetes, so you're running into problems with diet and exercise and other concerns.
I did hear the plea clearly at the end, though, around, Norma, from trying to get the Prime Minister a plane.
I believe something is in the works.
I'm going to leave it there because the connection is not great.
But the message was heard loud and clear.
We'll check back with you.
Thank you very much.
That's a couple of Canadians.
They're trying to get home to Mississauga.
As you heard, contrary to what other Canadians are not doing, they're happy to self-isolate ifthey get home, because that would, of course, be required.
We'll check back with them and try to get a better connection, too.
As we wait for cabinet ministersto give us an update on the government announcements today and the ongoing situation of thepandemic in this country, let mebring in this doctor.
Good to see you.



Morning.



**Rosemary**:

So let me start with that question there, that the Prime Minister got a couple of times and we've done reporting on. The issue that people are not supposed to be getting on planes if they have symptoms, they're not allowed on planes.
It has been left to airlines companies to sort of give a once-over and of course news is on the canadian to admit they may or may not have symptoms.
Should or is there anything elsethe government could be doing toeither check the health of people trying to get on planes, or enforce the 14-day isolation, because once you get on the plane, if you have any symptoms, that becomes very problematic.



It's true.
It's a very difficult situation.
One that is tough even if you do have a fever, it's tough to monitor.
Let's say you had a fever six hours ago, you may not have one right now, even without using Tylenol.
I think what they're doing, if someone looks clearly ill and coughing, they're not letting them on. The other problem with the airport screening, it doesn't work well.
You can miss half the people that are sickened and don't even know it. It's important we put the stress on having people watch their symptoms once they leave the airport and of course that 14-day isolation.
I urge people to continue to keep the isolation going, especially when you come back from travel.
We know that everything is not off the table.
We may see the quarantine act enacted in the next couple of days.



**Rosemary**:

The ministers are coming into the room, so about 30 seconds.
There is ongoing issue of testing.
We're up to 10, 000 tests a day in this country.
Obviously, I think the government would agree, everyone would like to test more.
is that something you would like to see as well? what should we be doing?



I agree, we should be trying to test wherever we can.
Mild cases and severe cases.
We'll see a ramping occupy up of that in the coming days.



I can see you're at work and we appreciate the time.
Thanks again, doctor.



> let's go back to Ottawa where we can tell you that the senate has, in fact, passed the legislation on the COVID-19 financial aid package.
It's off to royal assent.
Let's listen to the deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.



Let me start with an urgent reminder to Canadians, you must practise physical distancing, stay at home, eliminate contact with people at higher risk, particularly our beloved senior sand people in poor health.
Keep a distance from others.
and, of course, if you are doing an essential job, if you are, for example, a health care worker, one of the Canadians making sure we have food on our grocery store shelves, one of the people making sure we have lights and heat in our homes andbuildings, thank you very much for the hard and important work you are doing.




**Translator**:

Urgent reminder to Canadians.
You must practise physical distancing.
Stay at home.
Limit our eliminate all contact with people who are at high risk.
Keep a distance of two metres from others.



> as people are no doubt aware, parliament last night passed the COVID-19 response plan.
I'd like to thank all members of the house for that work.
I'm glad that we got there.
Today we will hear from Canada'sdeputy chief public health officer from the Minister of indigenous services, Marc miller -- Minister of Canadian heritage, Steven guilbeault and bill morneau.
Also with me to answer the questions are the chief officer of health at indigenous services.
Our Minister of employment, Carla qualtrough and the president of the treasury board and vice president of the COVID-19 committee.



Globally, there are over 420, 000 cases of COVID-19 affecting every country around the world.
In Canada, as of this moment, there are 3, 197 cases of COVID-19 and 27 deaths.
We have now tested over 142, 000 people in Canada, which is more than 20, 000 additional people tested since yesterday.
In the early part of the outbreak, most of our cases were linked to travel outside of Canada.
While more cases now are community-acquired than are travel-related, we still need todo all we can to reduce the impact of travel imported cases.
For all of those already in self-isolation, we know this is difficult and we're grateful forthe sacrifice you're making to keep others safe.




**Translator**:

If you don't have any symptoms, you can go outside for a walk, as long as you stay at least two metres from others.
As always, don't touch common surfaces such as door handles and wash your hands carefully after you leave home and as soon as you're back at home.
For those who do develop symptoms, regardless of how serious they are, you must stay at home at all times.
Online tools will help you to determine if you need greater evaluation or whether you need acovid-19 test.
Please look at what is at Canada.
Ca.



> if you're not experiencing st imp symptoms, it's okay to go out for a walk.
As always, avoid touching commonsurfaces, door knobs, and wash your hands thoroughly.
For those who do develop symptoms, no matter how mild, you must remember to remain inside your house at all times.
Right now is an extremely critical time for all of us to get it right.
We need to get this done.
Let's plank the curve.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Njoo.
Now we'll hear from Marc miller, Minister of indigenous services.
first nations, inuit and metis are among the most vulnerable incanada.
and during this crisis in particular, those in remote and fly-in only parts of the countryare vulnerable.
I want to reiterate that My solepriority, one that is shared by the government of Canada, is thehealth and safety of indigenous peoples in Canada.



We recognize that the COVID-19 situation in Canada is evolving rapidly.
Economic response plan announced by the Prime Minister last week, our government is providing $305million through the indigenous community support fund directly to first nations, Inuit and met is leadership to provide tho me with maximum flexibility possible to do what they need to support their communities.
The allocation of funds reflect discussions we've had with firstnations, Inuit and met is partners in each province and territory about their unique and specific priorities during this pandemic.
These funds will flow directly to indigenous communities with maximum flexibility to help adapt responses to address localneeds.
We will do this quickly and wit ha sense of urgency that the situation obviously necessitates.
I want to stress that this is only one of the financial measures that we're contemplating for first nations, Inuit and metis.




**Translator**:

This may lead to increased support for seniors, food support, help for children, and help for those who are unemployed.
Mental health support.
Or even an emergency intervention services.
The first nations portion of this is $250 million.
Each first nation will get a base amount adjusted for population, remoteness and community well-being.
The inuit portion is $45 millionand will flow to each of the four inuit claim organizations through allocation determined byi.
T.k. and regional leadership.
For metis, there will be $30 million which will flow through each governing member.
The remaining percentage which accounts for $15 million will support regional, urban and indigenous organizations supporting those who live away from their communities.
It will allow us to address measures quickly.
From closing their borders to declaring local states of emergency.
I want to recognize their important work in the strength they've shown, but let me be clear, this is just the beginning.
We know that more support will be needed and we'll be there to make sure no indigenous community is left behind.
Our government is here to support you during this time.
Miigwech.



Thank you very much.
Now we'll hear from -- Minister of Canadian heritage, Mr. Stevenguilbeault.



Good afternoon, I think we can take time to recognize how the current situation shows we have to show solidarity and take care of each other.
This is a complex situation and evolving rapidly.
All sectors have to be taken into account.
There are journalists who in normal situations, crisis situations with experiencing great difficulties because they lose ad revenue.
It's crucial that Canadians can obtain factual information related to COVID-19. This is why the government of Canada is taking immediate action so Canadians can continue to access diverse and reliable sources of news.




**Translator**:

First, I'm pleased to announce that on behalf of My colleague, the Minister of Canadian revenue, that the independent committee that is working with the C.R.A. is going to implement tax measures announced in the 2019, they are now formal.
Moreover, that based on the $30 million invested on our government in a national awareness campaign about COVID-19, we will -- this will be inducted in canadian media, whether it's TN tv, newspapers, online, so that the revenues generated by this campaign breathe new life into our media.
The Minister of public works is working on this file.
I want to mention the initiativeof the canadian medical association, the royal college of physician and surgeons and the college of family physiciansof Canada, coordinated by the canadian public health association and supported by volunteer work and advertising agency.
Together they are preparing a public health campaign and partnering with canadian media and online platform to air it. This is a reminder of how Canadians can pull together to help each other.
Finally, because immediate access to liquidity is critical.
The department is putting in a simplified application process for the canadian book fund and the canadian periodical fund.
This means that beneficiaries ofthese programmes will be receiving their 20-21 funding within the next few weeks as opposed to the next few months.
We take these measures to ensurethat all Canadians can receive factual information and to support our media and cultural organizations.
Thank you.



Okay.
Thank you, now we'll hear from our finance Minister.
Bill, please.



Thanks.
Thank you.
First of all, let me say thank you to all of the parties that worked together last night to get unanimous con send on our legislation allowing us to move forward with the measures we know we need to move forward with to support Canadians.
As you heard me say, extraordinary challenges necessitate extraordinary measures.
and that is indeed how we've gotten to where we are with the benefits that we are putting forward to support Canadians, the benefits we're putting forward to support businesses and benefits we're putting forward to support our economy.
I'd like to walk through where we are right now.
We have realized over the last week that the very best way to support Canadians who are out ofwork, who are sick, who are in situation where they're supporting on elderly parent, where they're at home because they're protecting themselves and their families, is by having one emergency benefit.
In the legislation we moved forward with, it's one emergencybenefit, the Canada emergency response benefit.
The idea is that we're going to deliver for every Canadian that finds themselves in a situation where they've earned revenue in the past 12 months, so $5, 000 ormore, and they don't have any income as a result of COVID-19, they can get this benefit.
It's $2, 000 per month for four months.
So what we're doing is ensuring that we enable people to bridge through this very difficult time so they have the resources they need for themselves and their families.
We've designed this in a way so it's a wage subsidy delivered directly to employees, to people.
So what this means is that for an employer, they will not have to separate the employment of their employees from their organization.
So in that way, we're directly supporting employers.
They will just be in a situationwhere, if this employee is no longer receiving income from their company, they can in fact be guaranteed this employee will be able to apply in a simple way and get access to $2, 000 per month for four months.
That is, we think, critically important.
What we've done over the course of the last week is to make sure that these benefits can be delivered, delivered in a simple and efficient way, getting money into peoples' pockets as rapidly as possible.
We're working hard to make sure that administration is able to be done.
We're targeting the week of April Th for us to be able to deliver on this for people.
That is important.
There is more work to be done to ensure people that we can deal with the very large volumes and that work is being done by My colleague, Carla qualtrough, My colleague Diane lebouthillier, as we think about how to best deliver on that.
What this means for the overall economy.
The impact of what we're doing for the economy is very significant.
The approach we decided to take means we're entirely funding this through the federal government.
and that means that the estimates in terms of the kind of economic support that we're giving are significantly different than they were last week.
So rather than the expectation of direct support to Canadians and to small businesses of $27 billion, we are expecting right now that this direct support be budgeted at $52 billion.
So that is a significant change because of the scale and the significance for people of thesebenefits.
So when you look at what we've done, that is $52 billion in direct support expected.
On top of that is there $55 billion in tax deferrals that we've said are there because neither individuals nor corporations will be forced to pay their income tax before August 31st.
So a total package of $107 billion into our economy.
I spent time yesterday on the phone with g7 finance ministers.
The day before I spent time on the phone with g20 finance ministers please.
and Canada is taking an appropriate, but also significant approach to responding to the incredible challenge we're facing today.




**Translator**:

I would like to say that it's very important for us to have a situation where people, regardless of their situation, if they don't have income over the next four months, for them to have $2, 000 a month for four months.
That means it's a direct wage subsidy to people and will also help companies.
That is very important.
So we're going to continue to look at how we can situation for small and medium-sized enterprises, but right now with these measures it's important tosee we have assistance for people, a total of $52 billion in direct support, and with the tax deferrals for individuals and companies, they can take up to August 31st to pay their taxes and this will inject another $55 billion in revenue into our economy.
It's a total of $107 billion.
So we can look at how we can be aggressive to deal with this situation today.
Thank you very much.
and of course I'm happy to answer your questions.



Okay.
Thank you very much, bill.
and all colleagues.
and we're indeed ready to answer your questions.
Three questions on the phone and then back to the room.
Operator? thank you for your patience.



**Reporter**:

The first question is "the globe and mail". go ahead.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good afternoon, thank you for doing this again today.
I understand that the health Minister just told the upper chamber that as of midnight tonight powers in the quarantine act are going to be used to ensure that travellers other than essential workers are going to be subject to a mandatory 14-day isolation.
My question is for the deputy Prime Minister, can you just speak to why the government is now taking this specific step to ensure that self-isolation for travellers is indeed mandatory? and are you planning an enforcement tool to go along with this, because how are you going to police people?



Thank you very much for the question and let me just reiterate that, yes, the health Minister will be using powers that she has under the quarantine act beginning at midnight tonight to impose a mandatory 14-day period of isolation on all people coming into Canada from outside Canada.
This issue was discussed at length at the coronavirus cabinet committee on Monday.
All Canadians have been working very, very hard to practise physical distancing in their lives and we have for some time now been urgently advising people coming into Canada to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.
We have decided that now is the time to make that measure mandatory.
I think we all really appreciatethat it is so important to have this self-isolation to protect the health and safety of Canadians.
and I may turn to Dr. Njoo tr --would you like to offer a publichealth perspective?



Certainly from a public health perspective we've been repeating many times that it's important in terms of physical distancing, so that individuals don't expose each other potentially to the virus.
and also the public health principle of 14 days being the outer limit for the incubation period, so respecting this public health principles, the Minister has said, travellers coming back to Canada, you might have been exposed.
It's important when you come back home to protect fellow Canadians by self-isolating.
This is just an appropriate step.



I will just add, we had the Prime Minister led a call with the premiers of the provinces and territories earlier this week.
We have seen the provinces stepping up and taking more clear measures within provinces and territories including some provinces and territories imposing restrictions on travel from outside the province and territory.
I think all Canadians understand that this is a serious situation.
It will get worse before it getsbetter.
As a country, we are lucky to have an outstanding national health care system and terrific health care professionals, but we all need to do what we can as we heard from Dr. Njoo at the beginning of this to flatten the curve and this mandatory isolation will help all of us dothat.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Just as a follow-up, I was wondering for the finance Minister, we understand that your department has been talkingto banks about possibly using them to distribute money to businesses specifically.
I'm wondering if the Minister can please provide a specific update on how these talks are going?



Thank you.
The banking system is a source of strength for Canada.
We have, I believe, the strongest banking system in the world.
It enables us to work together with the banking system to make sure we can actually provide the kind of credit that businesses need.
Businesses of all sizes.
We're working together and have been working literally overnight over the recent days to make sure that we have not only the support that we outlined last week, the business credit availability programme, the backstop of the business development bank of Canada and export development corporation for small business and medium-sized business loans, butalso the capacity for the banks to deliver on all sides of businesses, the kind of credit they need to get through a challenging time.
I would say the discussions are going very well.
The banks are working well together with us, but we don't have anything final to report interms of the parameters.
When I do have those final parameters, I'll be coming to betransparent as rapidly as possible.



Thank you.
Operator, next question, please.



The next question is from Canadian press.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.



**Translator**:

Mr. Morneau, I have a question about the new benefits.
The problem that everyone said is the distribution of funds.
and some people won't get these funds for at least three weeks at least.
What are you going to make sure the people get their funds quicker? that you can reach everyone.



Thank you.
That is a very important question.
Over the past few days and weeks, we've worked together to ensure that we can have a simple and efficient approach so that we can quickly get funds to Canadians which is necessary in our current situation.
So we found a few systems within the federal government that can help us to have a very efficient and quick approach.
It will take a few days and I'm sure that we have to make sure that the system is working properly.
and I know that we have to do this as quickly as possible and that is exactly what we want to do. Today we think that in the week of April Th is when we'll be able to deliver these funds for Canadians.
But if there are any new -- if there is any new information, we will be giving it to you day by day.
It's really important to know that we're absolutely in a situation where this is the most important thing for us every day, myself and Carla qualtrough, and Diane lebouthillier are looking at these important systems.



**Reporter**:

I understand the reference, but it won't be quicker.
It will take another three weeks.
Even if we talk about the 10 days that could be added to the day of April Th as the Prime Minister said.
So, there could even be a portal and it might work, can you comment on that? I have another question about the quarantine that Minister hajdu is imposing and given what is happening in the United States, what are you going to do to impose this quarantine? I'm understanding we are ordering people to quarantine themselves, but do you have the means to check people who are entering the country and follow up with them 14 days after they enter the country.



thank you for your question, with respect to the quarantine, this is a change.
Now we're talking about a mandatory quarantine.
Obviously, we will have mechanisms in place to enforce the quarantine.
That will be for all travellers from abroad, including travellers from the United States except for workers who do essential work.
I'd also like to --



**Reporter**:

What mechanisms --



Answer.
I would like to I don't understand score our advice -- underscore our advice hasn't changed.
For a few days, we firmly advised all travellers from abroad to self-isolate once theyenter Canada.
The change taking place midnight -- as of midnight, the quarantine will become mandatory.



**Reporter**:

But what mechanisms are you talking about?



one follow-up question per call, please.



Thank you.
The next question is from althiaraj.



This wasn't going to be My question, but since you didn't answer it, what enforcement mechanisms are you going to use to ensure that people are abiding this quarantine?



It will from midnight tonight be a legal obligation of people entering Canada from outside Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.
I do want to emphasize essentialworkers are excluded as has beenthe case with the strong advice from the Prime Minister, from public health officials, for some days.
In terms of the specific penalties and enforcement mechanisms, we'll be giving you more information later today.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
and My question is actually for bill morneau.
I want to talk about the bill, yesterday's bill.
I would like to know what made you think that it would be a good idea to ask parliament for the powers to tax and spend without their approval until the end of 2021? not even this year, but next year.
What made you think that was an appropriate response to this crisis?



Well, thank you for the question.
and I think what I should start saying is that I'm pleased that we got last night, actually 6 a. M. this morning, unanimous consent with the other parties to move forward on the response plan for Canadians.
We know this is an extremely challenging time for people.
We need to respond appropriately.
The bill that we got to, that was worked through the system, is one that will allow us to have the abilities that we think we need.
What I can say is that last week you heard me say to Canadians, we will do whatever it takes to support them and to support our economy through this challengingtime.
and what you're seeing is that as we move forward, we will do that.
We will think about how we can have the ability to move quickly, to respond to challenges, events that are in many cases completely unforeseen.
What we see, not only in Canada but around the world is that the issues that we're facing one week are different, significantly different in many cases than the issues we saw the week before.
Canadians expect us to be prepared to deal with these challenges, to have the ability to move quickly.
To have the funding so whether we need to buy personal protective gear on a moment's notice because we can find it, or whether we need to support a province that is in extreme challenge because of their situation, that we have the capacity to do that.
So we're seeking to make sure that we have the ability to do that.
We know that sometimes these authorities will be required at an unprecedented speed.
You're hearing talk today about the need to get back to you with details this afternoon on important measures.
We're working in order to make sure we have the capacity to protect Canadians, to get ourselves through this and come out of this challenge.
This is, we expect, a very challenging time, but a temporary time, to come out of this with our economy intact.
We unfortunately do not know the depth or the duration of this challenge and that's why we're keen to be working together to other parties to make sure we continue to have that capacity to respond in a very, very timely way to every challenge wesee.



Questions before we go back to the homes.



Julie van Duse with CBC.
Donald trump, American president, is looking towards Easter, which is April 12th.
He wants American workers back to work.
Can Canadians expect to be back to work around the same time?



Thank you for the question, Julie.
Our approach in Canada is to act very much in accordance with science and with the advice of our excellent public health officials.
Many Canadians are at work today providing essential services and know that all of us are really, really grateful to thosecanadians.
As for Canadians who are doing non-essential work or able to work from home, we need to continue to maintain these practises of physical distancingto be sure that we can flatten the curve or in the term that Dr. Njoo and Dr. Tam have been using, plank the curve.
I know that we all appreciate, and certainly after the debate in parliament last night we appreciate it even more, physical distancing does come atan economic cost.
Our government has taken -- you've heard more about it now -- very significant measuresto support Canadians through this time.
But what I would like to say to Canadians -- and I think the whole country gets this -- it isbetter for the health and safetyof Canadians and in the medium term it is better for our economy to practise physical distancing now, to flatten the curve, and to be able to get outof this.
In terms of specific time lines, I think what we need to do and what we are doing is following the science and see how the situation is developing.
and that's what we're going to do. Maybe Dr. Njoo wants to add.



If you look at the science and evidence and the experience of other countries around the world with the pandemic, I can say it's not days and weeks, but certainly months that this pandemic will endure.
So certainly from a public health perspective, we're not thinking it's going to be over in the next few days or so.



**Reporter**:

With this plan, and turns a blind eye to the impact of the virus, what is your plan to step up screening at the border for everyone crossing it, including essential workers?



Well, I think we announced today some stepped-up border measures which are very important ones.
The mandatory quarantine.
I do want to say about those borders measures, I trust Canadians so much.
Canadians are great and people have been making real personal sacrifices to self-isolate and practise physical distancing.
At the same time, I think all ofus are going to be and feel safer with mandatory quarantine for anyone entering Canada.
In terms of essential workers, we need to be really thoughtful about what we do there.
Let me give you the example of truckers.
Something that we have discussedin government and with business and with labour leaders extensively.
We rely on cross-border trade for essential goods like the food in our grocery stores, for essential medical supplies.
and those goods arrive very often by truck.
So we need to be thoughtful about how the people who providethose essential services including facilitating cross border trade are treated and that is why Minister hajdu specifically said hat the mandatory quarantine will not apply to essential workers.
We, of course, understand that the situation in the world and on our continent is fluid and evolving.
and as the situation evolves, we're constantly -- by constantly, I mean every single hour -- reviewing additional measures including measures at the border.



Thank you.
I'll start with Minister miller.
We're hearing about a capacity shift to the south that doctors are returning from reserves to serve in communities, there is encouragement of telehealth.
is that shift happening? are there doctors from abroad? and how does that fit for the pledge to the indigenous Canadians.



Thank you for your excellent reporting on indigenous issues in particular.
There are realities that indigenous communities face, that is shortage of nurses and doctors.
and as part of the discussions, looking at what that gap is how to fill it in the most expeditious manner is part of the conversation.
This is an ongoing discussion that is happening in realtime.
I'll defer to tom to answer the direct questions, but as we identify the needs for surge capacity will allow us to deploy quickly in the region should the epidemic hit in a fashion we need to act and support rapidly, or getting out the basic public message, that comes with a lot of discussions over financial resources, but also physical resources, personal protection equipment and getting doctors and nurses on site in a rapid fashion, in a way that will best serve those communities.
I'll let tom answer the rest of the question.



Thank you very much.
We are working with the network of physicians and nurses and other health professionals in order for them to be part of the surge capacity should a community need that.
Thank you.



**Reporter**:

Question for doctor, we have provinces that are shifting to satellite labs away from the central labs.
is everything still confirmed at the national microbiology lab.
What is the service standard? and what is the current backlog of the samples to be tested?



Okay, so in terms of the testing regime, at the beginning of the situation in January, certainly all of the laboratory confirmations were done by our national microbiology laboratory, but what happened Osgood collaboration between our laboratory and the ones in the province and territories and now we have a validated.
So there is no need to have the test or reconfirmed if one of the provincial labs validates it, has their own test result aspositive, that is confirmed.
It doesn't have to go to the mml.
At this point, it's there to help the smaller provinces that may not have the capacity.
and certainly in terms of the turnaround time, once they get the sample it takes less than a day.



Thank you for taking My question.
My first question for Dr. Njoo.
It's our understanding that c13 let's the government create invention to respond to the health emergency? does this apply to drugs and could it lead to vaccines?



That is out of My scope in terms of My expertise.
Certainly as a public health physician, we're working closely with health Canada, but if you're looking at licensing regulations, I'm not in a position to answer that.
We know obviously, our Minister of health, Minister hajdu, has approved some of the new testingtechnology, so I can speak to the posture in terms of the laboratory test approaching approach, but I can't speak to that.



Worth a shot.
You have said there is additional aid and measures coming.
I'm wondering can you know when we'll see the aid and what areasit's going to be in and when we're going to see the energy package?



We have been working to make sure we deal with the most urgent and important issues first.
and what, from our perspective, we've realized is that there will be Canadians, many Canadians, who find themselves without income, perhaps already, and certainly in the coming days.
That's why we put that the very first thing on our agenda, pretty much simultaneously with es aid we need to support businesses so they can bridge this time from where we are today to when we get through theissue.
That has meant we need to work on multiple fronts at the same time.
We need to make sure we have adequate financial capability for firms to make that possible.
So that's why we're working with the banks to make sure credit available to businesses small and large.
and it means we need to be think being not only the scale of the companies, but also the particular sectors.
You mentioned the oil and gas sector, the energy sector.
It is one of the sectors that is particularly hard-hit because they have the issue both around the COVID-19 challenge and around the low price of oil and gas as a result of the opec decision.
So we know that is at or near the front of the things we need to be concerned about, because the small and medium-sized enterprises in that sector are particularly vulnerable.
I want to make sure people understand it's multiple sectors.
We're looking at the airlines sector.
We're looking at the hospitalitysector writ large which is facing enormous challenges, making sure we can deliver from them.
In terms of when we have more to say, it will be in the very nearterm.
In the coming days we want to give people a more full understanding how the impacts will be mitigated to the best extent possible in this challenging time.
Today, I think what you've heardus say is not only are we ensuring that people have accessto $2, 000 a month for four months, but that is something that is directly advantaging companies, because the companiesdon't need to separate their employee from their company.
They just need to say, we can't pay you during this time period.
When that happens, there is a direct wage subsidy to people, to employees, so they can actually live their lives when this done and they can go back to work for their employers and that we think is critically important.



We're going to take three questions.
One in french to start:



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

Thank you.
Mr. Morneau, I'd like to understand your first assistance announcement was a week ago already and you said we're looking at April Th for an online portal, another 10 days, which brings us to the 17th of April, Mr. Trudeau says it could take a few days for a cheque, that will lead us to the 27th.
There are a million people who asked for EU last week.
People need the money urgently and you're telling them 27 days from the first announcement and when the cheque arrives.
is that reasonable? how can you justify such a delay?



Thank you for your question.
I absolutely agree that this situation is urgent.
and that is why we found a simple and efficient way to deliver our aid.
and that's what we're proposing.
We're going to have a system that will be delivered to people, delivering money in the coming weeks.
We think it will start in the week of April 6th.
I can't tell you an exact date because we're ensuring that our system will be working.
Clearly, our systems didn't have the capacity to face -- rise to this challenge and that's why we're finding away to deal with it. It's urgent, important and we'regoing to be there.
I know it will take another few days.
I know it's hard for people.
and that's absolutely true.
But we have to do this, we have to have an approach that works.
Otherwise, the situation will get even worse.
In the coming days, we're going to have more details.
We'll be able to tell you exactly how and when and, of course, we do have to work together to ensure -- we do have good approach.



**Reporter**:

My question is veryprecise.
I'm not sure if someone can answer it. If you don't have the answer that is okay, but the work that is being done on the efficient system to distribute funding to Canada, when did the technical work actually begin to make the system work? we heard last week.
We waited for the bill to be adopted.
But we want to know when you started to elaborating the system that you're going to implement?



Answer.
We started the approach over the past couple of weeks.
That was already under way.
and now we want to make sure that given the scale and the level of demand, that we're able to ensure that the money will be there for people.
That's very important.
We're going to have more to say about this and the work which started more than a week ago.
and we're going to utilize the most efficient system in the federal government to ensure that the funds are there.
and the reason we decided this week to have a single benefit in place for all Canadians in a situation where they're lacking income because of COVID-19 is because, clearly, we do have to have a system that is efficient and strong enough to make sure that we'll be there for them.
and I think we found a good solution and we're going to continue to work to ensure that the system will function as it should.



Thank you.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you, the next question.
Toronto star" go ahead.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Just on the next step of the financial aid targeted at certain sectors, does the bill that we expect to be passed by the senate today, the new bill, give the government the power to enact that spending, to send out the next step of money for this without recalling parliament, without passing another bill?



I think that question was former?



**Reporter**:

Yes.



I do, too.



So what is clear, we need to have the capacity in this government to act rapidly.
We also need to think about the challenge that we're facing.
We know that getting the opportunity for credit to businesses small, medium and large is critically important.
We know that in order to do that we need to have the authorities to make sure that business development bank of Canada, export development corporation, both have the ability to deliver.
That goes as well for farm credit Canada.
So the bill as it's being looked at right now by the senate enables us to list those -- lift those limits so we can deliver that sort of financial credit appropriately considered to all those organizations and the parliament has approved this morning, as you know, at 6:00, that bill that does allow us that capacity.
That's why we're working together with the banks to ensure we get it out in a rapid way for businesses facing challenges.



Just as a follow-up, I think this might be for the deputy Prime Minister on the enforced mandatory quarantine.
We know that a lot of people returned from spring break, we've seen repatriation flights in recent days.
Will this apply retroactively topeople who have come back to Canada recently? will it apply retroactively?



No, the mandatory isolation applies at midnight tonight.
For all travellers into Canada.
and just let me remind people that already when people say fly into Canada, already at those kiosks, you get a screen which strongly recommends that you self-isolate for 14 days.
and you have to acknowledge thatyou have received that strong recommendation.
So that is already in place.
People are already clearly beingadvised to do this.
and they need to acknowledge they're advised to do this.
We will, from midnight tonight, be taking the contact details ofall returning -- well, of all people coming into Canada, and then we'll follow up with them to be sure that they are, indeed, self-isolating because as of midnight that becomes mandatory.
But let me emphasize, you shouldbe doing it already.
This is a step we can all take to protect the health and safetyof Canadians and ultimately to ensure that our economic reboundcomes more quickly.
If we can flatten the curve, then we can go back to normal life more quickly.



Thank you, one last question on the phone.
and then we'll take one from theroom.
Call it a day.



Thank you.
The next question is from radio-Canada.
Go ahead, your line is open.



**Reporter**:

transwe've seen that the situation is worsening in the United States and they're close to us. I'd like to know, to what extentdoes this concern you? [please stand by]interpreter]this quarantine is nowmandatory, under law, asmidnight tonight.
It is another measure thatstrengthens our ability toprotect Canadians fromchallenges and evenpotentially threats thatexist elsewhere in theworld.
Notably, south of theborder.
[speaking throhinterpreter]it is is a possibility, possibly -- could youconsider restrictingtraffic additionally toavoid contaminationincreasing in Canada?



All options are on thetable.
We do have to look at allpossibilities.
Always, of course, with the concern of having essential goods in canadaand medical equipment, food that people need to live and even survive incanada.
But, of course, we always have to keep a careful eye on what is happening in the United States.
Thank you.
[end of translation]



I'll go back to the room for one lastquestion.
Mike from global?



I'm good.



Maybe one last question on the phone, maybe, operator?



Certainly.
The next question is fromlauren Gardner of"polÍtico." please go ahead, your lineis open.



**Caller**:

Thanks for taking My question.
Both the prime minister and Mr. Declaude have indicated that restrictions at thecanada-United States border couldbe tightened even further, depending on how thenumber of cases out in thestate.
and the Minister alsomentioned workers andthat.
Could you describe what itwould take, what thethreshold might be for thegovernor to furthertighten what is alreadyhappening at the border, and what are thecontingency plans that theprime Minister mentionedyesterday at the borderlooks like?



**Chrystia Freeland**:

Think we have seen today some of the contingency plans that the Prime Minister was referring to coming into force.
Obligatory quarantine of everyone coming intocanada is a serious further step.
It is an important step, and it should make allcanadians feel much safer.
We took, last week, very careful and very significant measures when it comes to our border with the United States.
Measures that we took very much in collaboration and cooperation with ouramerican neighbours, and measures that were carefully designed to ensure that essentialwork, essential trade cancontinue.
You heard us all today really emphasizing the extent to which the foo don our tables, the drugs in our drugstores really depend on thatcross-border trade.
I do want to take a minuteto thank the truckers whoare driving back and forthacross the border everyday.
They are doing importantwork, which we need toactually survive.
We are, of course, thinking very carefullyabout additional measures.
You've seen us already inthe course of just thepast 10 days take a realseries of steps to improvecontrol at the border, including the obligatoryquarantine.
That is something we'reconstantly reviewing, andwe will continue to reviewit.
I also do want to say thatcross-border traffic hasbeen decreasing verysignificantly.
So we have been seeingpeople responding both tothese border restrictions, and also to the broadermessage, which people arehearing from theirgovernments in both canadaand the United States, and, frankly, around theworld.
and that message is thatnow is then time to stayhome.
Now is the time topractice physicaldistancing, and that iswhat we are seeing on ourcontinent, at our border, and around the world.



**Caller**:

and as afollowup, ms. Freeland, I'm wondering what it was like to make these sorts of calls you were describing over the last10 days, underling year inunchartered territory and it is a pandemic, but this government has a history of projecting it is open to people coming from different places.
What has it been like to make these calls that are somewhat of a total 180 in some respects?



**Chrystia Freeland**:

Idon't believe they're at odds with our government'sor My core beliefs in anyway.
Our government totally understands that our absolute priority needs to be the health of safety ofcanadians.
In pursuit of that, the federal government, provincial governments, municipal leaders, indigenous leaders, Canadians visit the country have been doing extraordinary things.
Our children are not inschool.
Very, very many people are working from home.
Many people are not working at all.
We are practicing, all ofus, social distancing -- Hope all of us are practicing it -- in ways that have had a huge in pact on all of our lives.
These are extraordinarytimes, and I know that we all get that.
and those extraordinary changes absolutely need to have an impact, and have had an impact, on whatwe're doing at ourborders.
This is not any kind of shift in our government'sviews.
This is about taking very practical steps to protect the health and safety ofcanadians.
The 14-day quarantine is very much another step on that path.
and we will always put the health and safety ofcanadians first.
and I think all of us feel very clear and very confident that that is the right direction.



Okay.
MercÍ beaucoup.[speaking throughinterpreter]thank you very much.
That wraps up our pressconference for today.
[end of translation]



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is our daily briefing from cabinet ministers and public health officials on the pandemic in thiscountry.
a big bit of news came out actually in the senate Short time ago, where health Minister pattyhajdu was answering questions from senators around the COVID-19special aid package.
But as she was answeringthose questions, thehealth Minister announcedmuch tougher measures, asignificant move by thegovernment, to make surethat travelers returningto Canada who previouslyhad been asked toself-isolate for 14 daysare now going to beasked -- will be required, rather, to have isolationfor 14 days under thequarantine act.
Let me let the healthminister explain thismeasure.



Effective at midnighttonight, travelers returning to Canada, with the exception of essentialworkers, will be subject to a mandatory 14-dayisolation under the quarantine act.
It will provide the clarity about the essential needs toself-isolate.
Those who exhibit symptomsupon arriving to canadawill be forbidden to usepublic transportation.
and they will be forbiddento self-isolate wherethere are vulnerablepeople.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
and that is the healthminister, patty hajdu, with that news.
a little curious because the Prime Minister got couple of very specific questions about thatearlier, but did not int that the federal hint that the federal government was making this decision to use the quarantine act to enforce now isolation on people coming from outside of this country.
and still lots of questions in that press conference left, Vassy, about how that actuallyworks.
and I'm still not clear on what that actually means.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
It sounds like, orchrystia Freeland seemed to indicate that the enforcement side ofthings, how it will work, that information will be released later today.
You're right that the prime Minister got this exact question: why are you using the honoursystem? why don't you use the quarantine act to enforce this ask you have made.
He specifically did not say it will be used.
He said this is what isrequired, and then minutes later the health minister made that announcement.
This, according to minister Freeland, becomes legal obligation as ofmidnight.
and it also excludes essential workers.
So I think that is pert pertinent to a lot of the people going cross-border.
You're not supposed to betraveling between theborders, but if you are, for example, a truckerthat is bringing goodsthat Canadians need, orshipping that type ofthing, it sounds like youwould be excluded fromthis.
and if you are going toenforce this, whatpenalties do people faceif they don't comply? how are you going to evenfind out they're notcomplying? how is this logisticallygoing to work.
and the government at thispoint provided no detailson that.
Deputy prime ministerchrystia freelandindicating that thatspecific information wouldcome later today.



**Rosemary**:

and the only other hint I think we got on how it might work, I think it was the deputy prime Minister again saying we will follow up with them after they have been taken into different location.
Patty hajdu as well suggesting that the public health agency might house these people temporarily, if needed, or get them to their next location in order to isolate in mandatory way.
It is obviously part of the consequence of the fact that the United States does not seem to have a handle on thecovid-19 pandemic in anyway, shape, or form.
If you look at new York, which we, of course, share aborted with, things are not going well.
and when you have the United States president saying things like "this is going to be over in two weeks," that is obviously cause of concern for Canada.
and it means all of thecanadians waiting to are repatriated will be in an enforced mandatory isolation for 14 days because some peopleweren't following therules.
I'll going to Kathryn to circle on the other bigannouncement.
There is always news during this time, and that is on the Canada emergency response benefit.
The finance Minister will receive -- he was asked about how that is going towork.
Kathryn, what stood out for you there?



**HE IS CONTINUING TO BEPRESSED ABOUT THE BIGQUESTION IN ALL OF THIS, WHICH IS**:

When are you going to be able to deliver this? now you've got to get the mechanism in place and get the money out to people.
How can you explain tocanadians that this is taking so long? and the government keepssaying, you know, this is an extraordinary effort.
It is an unprecedentedeffort.
They're sieges with the urgency of this.
We got some information about the number of people who have been transferred over in their jobs.
1300 people who have come from other parts of government who are trying to help process all of these applications.
We know for anyone who is listening and wants to know what is going tohappen, the government is talking about getting some sort of online portal up, perhaps as early asapril 6th, and definitely questions abouttimeline.
As we creep closer and closer to the end of themonth, and many people have bills coming up -- would also note on that question about the quarantine act and the measures patty hajdu will be putting into place, she did say over the weekend that one of the options open to her under the quarantine act are fine sand criminal penalties.
