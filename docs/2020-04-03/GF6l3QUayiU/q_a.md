Prime Minister, Canada, when you came to power, you announced that Canada is back, the united nations is asking for $2 billion in emergency funding for COVID-19. is your government prepared to going this -- [inaudible]-- and setting aside -- to countries that are very hard hit and not by this equipment on themarkets?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

In our billion dollar COVID-19 response announced lastweek, we had already set aside money for international efforts.
We, of course, will work with the u. N., continue to work with international partners on financial support to ensure that we can respond to this global pandemic with global resources.
Canada will be there to participate.
and I can also highlight on your second question that we are ramping up production of necessary equipment of emergency medical equipment, of medications.
We know that there is a potential need for much more in Canada, but there is certainly need for much more around the world and Canada will be part the solution, not just to make sure Canada has all the supplies needed for our citizens, but we will have hopefully equipment and supplies to share with the vulnerable parts of the world that will desperately need help.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
It was mentioned yesterday that there would be additional medical equipment to help people who are infected with COVID-19, but on the ground there are nurses who are afraid they won'thave that proper medical equipment.
Are you able to guarantee the provinces that medical equipment will be provided to them so they can care for patients?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Thank you for that question.
This is something that we had a lengthy discussion about during My call with the premiers.
We know that there are different needs at different times depending on the region of the country and we will do everything necessary to ensure that every area, every region, has what it needs to respond to the needs of infected individuals.
We want that equipment to be shared across the country but we will have to continue to deploy our efforts to increase the amount of equipment that is available and the essential equipment that people are looking for.
and that's exactly what we're doing, but there has to be more coordination between the provinces and the federal government and that will ensure that we can meet peoples' needs wherever they are in Canada.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Justin ling, from freelance.
Go ahead.

Prime Minister, last week I asked you about the possibility of reducing the prison population to help combat potential spread of COVID-19. Since then I've heard from prisoners, inmates and guards who said that prisons are not ready, that they're release is not contemplated, there is not enough soap, the sanitary conditions are worse and guards are allowed into the prison even after returning from abroad.
What are you going to do continue reducing the risk to the federal institutions and is releasing inmates on the table?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize that the incarcerated population is at greater risk contracting and spreading COVID-19. That's why we're working closely with corrections Canada to ensure we're looking at a broad range of measures to keep both those who work in our correctional facilities, but also those who are residents there, to make sure we're doing things that will keep them safe.
I have said multiple times we'renot taking anything off the table in terms of options in order to keep Canadians safe.
and we will continue our discussions with corrections Canada to look at options and to look at ways that we're going to keep people safe right across the country wherever they be.
