and CBC News.
Ca. The senate is reviewing the government's $82 million emergency bill designed to help millions of Canadians financially survive this pandemic.
Let's give you a look inside the senate at this hour.
The finance Minister, bill morneau there to answer questions.
Obviously with a limited number of senators in the chamber.
It comes after a 14-hour delay in debate on the main bill inside the house of commons lastnight.
The legislation finally moved from the house to the senate at around 6:00 a. M. we're of course as we do every day expecting to hear from the Prime Minister on this and other updates from his government.
He'll be expected to talk about when this emergency aid will begin to flow.
a critical question for many of you.
We'll bring you his daily address to the nation as soon as it begins, that is of course, his front door.
We're all familiar with it. Justin Trudeau on his 14th day of self-isolation, unclear when he will be no longer working from home, but he has completed the 14 days at the end of today.
I want to bring in the host of "power and politics" Vassy kapelos and catherine cullen.
Both joining me. We'll keep the senate shot up and the Prime Minister's front door, but there were -- after wegot past the various negotiations inside the house ofcommons last night, which did change the bill in many ways in terms of allowing some more oversight of what the governmentwas going to do, we did get moreinformation this morning from bill morneau Mon what is essentially an amalgamation of two pieces that were going to help Canadians.
It is now just called the canadaemergency response benefit and it means that all Canadians who have ceased working due to COVID-19 will be able to receivethis new benefit.
Vassy, I'm going to start with you to go over what that means for Canadians.



**Vassy**:

Right, they combined what was originally two different streams of money into one, the thinking behind it at this point, although yet to be tested, is that this makes it more accessible, easier technically to get the money out to Canadians and it covers a wide range.
I think this is the most important thing to get across to people watching today.
Before, there were so many questions and understandably so about do I qualify for this? I'm not sick, but I have to stay home because My kids' school is closed, am I able to access thismoney? here's what I understand the Prime Minister will outline and what we've heard so far from bill morneau, the benefit would provide support for up to 16 weeks I can say at this point.
My understanding is and the information I believe that is about to be released, that would be $2, 000 a month per -- for four months.
So a biweekly check, but it's about $2, 000 a month.
Here's who covered.
People who lost their jobs, people who are sick quarantined, taking care of someone who is sick.
Parents who have to stay home without pay to take care of kids who are home either because the kids are sick or the schools are closed which is the case across the country.
Day cares are closed as well.
Also, this is a big one, I know we had Howard on asking about this, it will cover self-employed Canadians and contract workers.
Also the bar that you have to reach to access that money is pretty low.
You just have to have been out of work for two weeks.
That's My understanding at this point.
I think there are a lot of genuine questions about the ability to get the money out, how fast it will come, because there will be a wait for this.
But the government and through this legislation last night, allparties agreed it would be widely accessible to a wide swath of Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

It does seem a little bit like an acknowledgment on the government's part, that the first crack wasn't necessarily the best solution, they needed something broader and something they hope will work faster, although there are still questions about the capacity of government to get this to peoplequickly.



Absolutely, we've seen the numbers, staggering.
Almost a million claims to EU last week, compared to 27, 000 for the week the year previous.
Talking to officials, they say they're ramping up the process.
They got since last week 143, 000claims out the door.
That is a big ramp-up. When you compare that to the scope of the problem, obviously, they're really not anywhere close to that yet.
So a lot of work behind the scenes in attempt to get more personnel in place and the systems in place to deal with.
The government said it really is, along with the health and safety of Canadians, this is their top priority making sure people get money into their pockets.
There is a whole area of scrutiny whether they're going to be able to do that.
We heard bill morneau talking about that.
Francois legault said publicly that the Prime Minister ensured him has the cheques would go outapril 6th.
Bill morneau said that is the target week, essentially, to getthe money out the doors.
So there is a question of can ithappen in a timely fashion? obviously people have rent, mortgage payments before then.
There is also the question of whether or not this goes far enough.
For instance, people who say they can't pay their rent, theirmortgages, they're not getting the help from the bank they hoped.
One woman reached out to me on Twitter and said I'm a freelancer, I'm not making no income, but it's been reduced.
My understanding is I don't qualify because I'm still takingin a little bit of income.
We know the government has said this is a first step, but a lot of people are impatient to see the results.



**Rosemary**:

Let me give a couple more details of what we know because there are so many asking on Twitter and in e-mails.
If you are already receiving ei and sickness benefits as of today, you'll continue to receive those and you do not need to apply for the emergency response benefit.
If you a I applied for -- applied for ei and are waiting for your application to process, you don't need to reapply.
Don't think you have to go in and do it again.
This will apply for you.
The portal for accessing this emergency response benefit is not up yet, so don't panic when you don't see it. The government is intending to get that up by early April, which is why we're saying April 6th seems a little optimistic, but you should begin to receive your emergency benefit payments within 10 days of making application.
This will be a monumental feat if the governments can actually pull this off.
I mean all the people behind thepoliticians who have made this decision.
We'll go back to this because itis critical information as more and more people in country are laid off or put out of work.
But first, as we wait for the Prime Minister coming up in about 8 minutes, let me bring inpremier blaine Higgs.
Hg's' the premier of Nova Scotia.
He joins me now from fredericton.
Good to see you, premier.



Good day.



**Rosemary**:

To talk to you rather.
[laughter] one of the reasons we wanted to speak with you today, because you're one of the premiers, maybe the only one, who has been very publicly calling for the government to put in place the emergencies act.
Why is that needed for your province? why do you think it's needed for the country?



Well, what I believe we need across the country is a national strategy so we have consistency of health care, consistency of standards from one province to another, consistency of supplies.
We kind of competing with each other in terms of what initiative do we put in place, what measure and self-isolating, what closes, what stays open? I think this is a situation where we should have learned from other countries and their experiences.
We can be learning from other provinces, but the federal government can play an oversightrole in a consistent manner to ensure that every citizen in ourcountry has equal access to health care and protective equipment.



**Rosemary**:

Now I can see you, that's good.
You are maybe the only one, the only premier who is this determined or this convinced this is the answer.
We heard for instance, from the qu√âbec premier who said he wants the most flexibility.
He does not want the federal government to take this stance.
When you were on the call with the Prime Minister the other day, what was your impression about the likelihood this might happen?



Well, I think the message kind of got confused with the legislation and the addition of the kind of the unfettered spending rules that were combined with the emergency measures act and this bill that was trying to get through in terms of the financial package.
I think there was a lot of concern about that and I've shared that same concern about that, that kind of inclusion of the spending of the bill.
But this is different.
This is in relation to having an ability to exercise a national strategy around the health care and the treatment of citizens and the distribution of equipment.
I know everyone wants to do their own thing in some ways, the bigger provinces have better capabilities to do that and that is the reason for a standardization.
That's why we have a standard health care system in the country to make sure that the same measures are practised throughout.
In a crisis like this, we need to be more confident of that.



**Rosemary**:

You don't have an enormous number of cases now or yet.
What is it that your province islacking? we've heard different concerns around the country concerning medical supplies, what is it that you've asked the federal government to provide you with?



Certainly, we've given a list like others of critical components of testing and masks and things like that.
So we're currently fine in that regard with numbers, but we're anticipating where this is going to go and watching the rise elsewhere.
I expect the case load to go up, but we want to head that off as much as possible.
Right now our health care system is at a lower demand model because people are staying away from hospitals and people are not out moving around, which is exactly what we want, but I want to be prepared.
If we're learning from other provinces, I want to make sure that is universal across the country -- uniform across the country.



Do you have another call with the Prime Minister soon? do you expect to speak with him?



Well, we likely will have another call in relation to our members to discuss the pending issues the longer this goes on. Certainly in Atlantic Canada, the whole fishing industry is at risk over the coming months and weeks.
There is not one scheduled this week, but I anticipate there will be and as always, the deputy Prime Minister has made herself readily available and done that from the beginning.
We have access, we'll continue to stay connected with the Prime Minister's office.



**Rosemary**:

Premier Blaine Higgs of New Brunswick.
Good of you to make the time.
Best to the province and yourself.
All right, that's one other premier.
We've been trying to talk to premiers to get a perspective of what is happening in different regions of the country.
Everyone struggling with the same issue but in different ways.
That was a big concern, because it seemed you had to be sick or someone in the family sick, to access that.
This is explicit.
Basically anybody who is out of work because of anything to do with the pandemic, it appears would be able to access this money, which once again, My understanding is, is about $2, 000 a month for four months at this point.
and the hope is obviously that money can get out the door, but like I said, the conversations I'm having, there is a bunch of concern.
There are issues already with getting EU out the door with processing times.
Yes, the majority fall within the one-month window, but I think it's 20% to 30% of the claims take longer than that.
Obviously the burden of proof isa lot different now which could and should have impact on that capacity to deliver the money, but I think there is -- this is unprecedented, right, as we've been discussing on so many instances and parts of the story.
Also this, they've never had this many ei claims in a week.
I think there remains a big question mark on the ability to deliver, which I know people don't want to hear.
They're nervous about getting the money in time.
They're not going to get it before April 1 likely when they have to pay rent and mortgages, but they're worried about may 1st.



**Rosemary**:

Let me say further, they do have the employment insurance system which is an oldsystem, everyone would agree with that, operating, but they also have the Canada revenue agency operating and lots more people working for both of them.
There was one other provision, and people asked me about this, we got clarification from bill morneau in the senate.
He says that -- we have two minutes until the prime minister comes out, I'm told -- bill morneau says if you own a business and your business has been affected, you don't have business, it's a restaurant, youcan't have people in and you don't have orders, or what have you, all of your employees now have been affected by COVID-19, all of them can now access the emergency response benefit, but the owner of the business can also access that benefit.
Which I think was unclear to people -- self-employed people or people who owned their own business before.
This essentially means that anyone, as Vassy said there, whois affected in any way financially by the pandemic can tap into this.
and that seems to be the more direct or more complete responsethan perhaps we even saw last week.
I'll cut you off if the Prime Minister comes out.



The goal official are telling me of creating this response benefit is to make it simpler and more efficient for Canadians who are going to apply.
Simpler and more efficient for themselves.
There is nothing simple about this.
As we talk about the mechanisms of how this gets out the door, think the amount, too, is a big question.
People are pointing out there are European countries where they're a lot more aggressive in terms of how much wages.
You look at the temporary business wage subsidy, that's anelement, businesses are eligible to receive 10% of their payroll.
a lot of businesses saying this is not enough.
They would like to see a lot more money from the government to sustain themselves.
For many businesses this is a conversation that is live.
They're talking about being able to keep functioning -- some of them have had to close their doors -- but being able to do that in the next few days, couple of weeks.



**Rosemary**:

This answers some questions, but certainly not all of them.
Again, as we said, there is a question of timeliness around this.
We saw something yesterday that was supposed to be debated in four hours, ended up happening 15 hours after it spoke to. Here is the Prime Minister to speak to all of you.
