Canadian on the effort to contain COVID-19. As always, lots to talk about.
Just moments ago, for instance, Nova Scotia declared a state of emergency, which means now all provinces in this country have declared some state of emergency or other.
It has also restricted gatherings of more than five people.
That is one of the most dramatic steps taken by a province so far.
They are also now telling anyone coming into Nova Scotia that they need to self-isolate for 14 days.
Even if they've been inside this country.
One of just a number of atlantic provinces making that move.
and this hour, we are expecting to hear more about the federal response, the Prime Minister will give us some details on ottawa's plan to help stabilize the canadian economy.
The house of commons is expected to return here and vote on some of the measures announced last week on Tuesday.
But first let me start in Nova Scotia where that most recent news happened.
Last hour, stephen mcneil had sharp words for those who are not self-isolating or social distancing.
Take a listen.



Today, I need to focus on those who are not following public health advice.
Over the weekend, I saw and heard a far too many incidents of people gathering, blatantly disregarding the social and physical distance rules of staying six feet or two metres apart.
Moneys gathering on our beaches and in our parks.
Large groups of people congregating.
Young people playing street hockey.
Cars parked everywhere.
People disregarding law enforcement.
We are dealing with a deadly virus and this behaviour is unacceptable.
Today, effective immediately, I'm declaring a provincial state of emergency.
Minister porter is here to explain what that means and Minister furry is here to explain how we will enforce it. We are also reducing the size of gatherings effective immediately.
People cannot gather in groups of more than five.
You can still go outside but you walk to exercise, not to associatize.
Stay in your neighbourhood.
Walk around the block or down the street.
Our provincial parks are closed.
If you go there, you are trespassing and your vehicles will be towed.
You can get groceries, you can go to the pharmacy, but do not do it in packs.
Identify a single family member who can do those errands and if you are an individual helping neighbours, please continue to do so.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That was Stephen McNeil, the premier of Nova Scotia where there they have taken some extraordinary measures because, as the premier just said, people are simply not listening enough to advice from public health officials.
In fact, if you were on Twitter at all last night, we saw a number of examples of that trending on Twitter.
Large groups of people gathering at English bay in Vancouver.
So this is one province trying to take some extreme measures to crack down and have police enforce self-isolation and social distancing.
It will not be tonight one.
We've certainly seen that in Quebec as well.
Let me give you an update on where we stand in terms of cases right now in this country.
More than 1300 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed.
We are still at 19 deaths.
The most recent series of deaths, I believe it was four, happened in Quebec at a long-term care centre, which is one of the points of vulnerability that Canada's public health officer so worried about right now.
We are expecting to hear from the Prime Minister outside of his home, Rideau cottage there.
a door we've all become familiar with.
To hear more about a few things, but most particularly the legislative action that needs to happen this week to get people additional financial aid.
Let me bring in My colleague.
The cbc's david Cochrane.
Thank you for joining us on a Sunday.
So they are going to come back on Tuesday at noon it seems.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
It is going to be an extraordinary session of parliament, the likes of which we have never seen in this country.
Only about 30 M.P.s, proportionate to the set-up of the house and all M.P.s within driving distance.
The normal representation of the country will not be present in the house.
The partisan representation will and what will be a day of historic cooperation to deal with an unprecedented cooperation.
We are expecting to hear something from the house of commons about that from the Prime Minister today as well as an update on repatriation efforts yesterday.
I was watching from home yesterday talking about the first flight to come from morocco and spain and peru.
Obviously this is moving extremely fast and it is a very difficult and fluid situation.
We're expecting something from justin trudeaus on that.
and think we have to hear something from the Prime Minister on all of this blatant ignorance of the social distancing recommendations that have happened across the country.
They have been warning that they don't want to use the emergency act unless they absolutely have to. Counting on the municipalities and provinces to get ahead of it and we've seen this hopscotching of more restricting measures as each province ramps up their response to things and Nova Scotia banning groups of five and a under.
Quebec banning essentially all public gatherings in response to all of this.
Most Canadians seem to be listening.
But there are enough not Canadians not listening and it is a significant public health concerns for politicians at all levels.
Including the Prime Minister.
We heard patty hajdu say listen to this or severe restrictions will be coming.
I would have bet everything I have in the bank right now that the Prime Minister will be asked about that today.



**Rosemary**:

She made an extraordinary appeal to people saying you either do this to protect yourself and the health of others or your civil liberties will be suspended, essentially, because police will have to enforce this, writ large across the country.
and you're right.
We're seeing an escalation of those measures from police, from provinces, rather.
But it comes at a time when we see it's being ignored in places like France, for instance and it was certainly ignored in Italy and results in more cases and results in more death.
So, you know, even anecdotically I've heard of gatherings of friends and people and a neighbours and things and this could not be more serious.
This appeal from the government.
and from public health officials.



**Reporter**:

I heard a "new York times" reporter speaking about this in the context of the American situation saying that America was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and he made the point that you can't have liberty or happiness if you're not alive.
You might want to start prioritizing which of these things matter to you.
This is really it. Every single one of us is essentially an umber for COVID-19. The virus can't move without us moving around and I was in a grocery store yesterday and a guy would not stay six feet away from me when I kept asking him to do it. He said you're overreacting.
I'm like oh, My god, man, back off.
The message is not getting through for whatever reason.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. David, thank you for that.
I'll go quickly to Dr. Lin joining us now because the Prime Minister is expected to come out from his house around 11:15. CBC news medical contributor Dr. Lin.
Goo ed to see you.



Good to see you.



**Rosemary**:

What do you make of this that some provinces are having to crack down in a much more aggressive way not only quarantine, self-isolation, but in Nova Scotia, even over social distancing.



Right.
In other words, they're saying it hand worked.
The no rt nice way of saying to people stay away in each other because the virus needs to jump from one person to the next.
If you stay six feet away, it can't get to the next perpendicular.
-- the next person.
Once it's in the community, tracing is difficult and everyone needs testing and will overwhelm the health care system t. Idea is bring in these very strong measures and then put in that threat.
In other words, they don't really want to arrest everybody.
What they want to do is say this is serious.
Please just pay attention so we don't end up like Italy or France or china where they had to send drones around and had drones watching the streets and things like that.
So, the hope is that if we do this early, then they are not going to repeat some of the other provinces where we're seeing the numbers increasing every single day.



**Rosemary**:

What would you say to Canadians then still -- I made that example of English bay yesterday in British Columbia.
People who are still having play dates with large groups of children.
What do you say to Canadians still doing that? what is your best advice to them?



I think the problem is that we told everybody it's six people, right? people are expecting somebody coughing or sneezing and saying there was nobody coughing or sneezing.
We're hearing stories of people getting sick.
They went to a house party, 10 people.
Nobody was sick or coughing and got the virus.
Now we realise that if you are in close contact, the virus when people breathe out there may be some viruses there.
It doesn't go very far.
If I'm sitting next to you and really close to you, I may breathe that in. That is one of things that people worry about.
You don't look sick and yet you're able to pick it up. When you say small gathering, I don't want five people next to each other.
I want five people with six feet apart.



**Rosemary**:

You're probably not having a dinner party --



Over a really big table.



**Rosemary**:

That's right.
Dr. Lin, I'll leave it there for now.
Thank you for that advice.
We appreciate it. One of things that we're expecting the Prime Minister to talk about is the legislation that will be passed in an extraordinary way and extraordinarily quickly this week.
To allow workers and businesses to tap into some much needed financial aid.
Because many workers have been hit hard, of course, across the country.
I've heard from many of you on Twitter, wondering what to do and when this additional help will be available.
One of those industries, and there are so many, is construction workers.
Some are still able to work.
But many others have been laid off as the country becomes increasingly locked down.
Matthew day is a construction worker here in Ottawa.
He was recently laid off as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Hi, Matthew.
Good to see you.
I may cut you off as the Prime Minister meanter.
-- emerges.
Thank you for joining us. How are you doing?



Thank you very much.
We're doing Ok.so far.
It's just started.
I was laid off last week.
So applied for e. I., so that will take effect starring tomorrow.



**Rosemary**:

When we heard of this huge overload of the system, the Prime Minister said last week there were half a million people who had applied, you were paying into it already so you were obviously part of the system.
How difficult was it for you?



Actually, applying wasn't overly difficult.
I knew when My end date was going to be. My employer had already told us at the beginning of week that we were going to shut down by the end of week.
I was becoming too dangerous for the workers to come on site.
So a lot of us were able to apply preemptively and able to get on the site.
Calling was useless.
However a lot of people that work with me are private contractors and they can't apply at all until April.
Or at least a week into April and then again the system will be overloaded for the second time.



**Rosemary**:

Just so I understand correctly, why you got laid off, was it because people had to work in close quarters or because the contract was drying up?



Two plus quarters.
There are five major developments in the Ottawa area.
Three out of five completely shut down its construction sites.
We build new houses and three out of five had completely shut down as a result of not being able to control the spread, not being able to control social dis ens hating between the trades people within those houses.
and as a result, we didn't have the demand for our trade to go into those construction zones.
Therefore, we had to it shh it down.



**Rosemary**:

So, if our calculations are right, you get about $1800 a month, $450 a week for 18 weeks.
I imagine the government will extend that, if needed.
I think I hear some little people in the background.
Will that cover all the expenses that you have?



It won't. It actually won't even cover rent.
The average rent in Ottawa for a two-bedroom apartment or condo is $1800.
That's roughly about the max that people are going to get while on this employment insurance.
So it's not going to cover it. The child benefit increase that's come into effect won't come into effect until may.
For myself, that happened in the middle of the month so that is eight weeks away.
That is a very large concern.
We have spoken to banks and landlords.
The deferrals that trudeau has spoken about simply aren't coming into play.
People who --



**Rosemary**:

Because you rent, is that why? or because you have a mortgage?



I personally rent.
We're in close contact with our landlords who have been fantastic about it. They were told flat out that they didn't have -- qualify because they didn't have a mortgage long enough and I don't know how many people applied across Canada and for their own mortgage they were told they didn't qualify because they didn't have loss of income insurance.
I wasn't a part of their mortgage plan already, as a result they didn't qualify.
So it seems that the banks have the ability to defer mondayers.
However, they are not going outside of their regular streaming in order to do so. If you don't already qualify before this pandemic, you are not qualifying as a result of it.



**Rosemary**:

I have about a minute before the Prime Minister comes out of his house to talk to us. How stressed are you? how worry are you about things?



My biggest worry is that My necessities will be to go back to work before it is safe.
My wife and children will travel to family outside of Ottawa where they can stay in quarantine for 14 days.
My wife has a compromised immune system.
But I'll be forced to go back to work before it's safe to go back to work and that is why we're seeing this social spread is because most people are not in a position to stop working and stay at home and have that be the end of it. We have to get out there and pay bills and your other option is huge debt.
and how do you get out of that once this ends? and the answer is I don't know.
We're looking at long-term financial debt for a lot of Canadians and what does that do for us and small businesses around us when we come out of this pandemic.
Will with ve any disposable income to speak of? I won't. As a result, myself and many other people will end up back at work long before we should be there.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Matthew.
I know this is a situation that is playing out all too often right now across the country.
You are one example.
I appreciate you sharing our story.
I hope things improve.
They surely will for you and your family.



Thank you very much.
Appreciate you taking the time.



**Rosemary**:

Stay healthy.
Thank you.
There is Justin Trudeau coming out of his home, Rideau cottage, where he will address the country.
