### Summary:

 Since there is more support coming this week, that is where you'll find all the information you need and the help you deserve. For those of you who usually spend your Sundays in a place of worship, thank you for staying home today.
But we have to do this not just for ourselves but for our grandparents, our nurses, our doctors and everyone working at our hospitals.
The doctors and scientists have been clear that social distancing, which means staying two metres apart and at home as much as possible is the best way to help each other.
Thank you for helping your parents work from home.

I recognize that millions of Canadians are practicing social distancing, choosing to stay home and looking for ways to keep two metres apart from each other and taking this very seriously.
That's great because this is a situation in which individual Canadians behaving responsibly will help themselves, help their neighbours and mostly protect our health care workers.
We're continuing to work very closely with all provinces, with different orders of government to make sure that people are understanding what they need to do and doing it. We will continue to look at possible next steps that may become necessary.
But for now, we are telling people stay home, engage in social distancing.
We need to make sure we're using all different methods to connect and pass important messages to Canadians to make sure we know how to stay safe and we're properly protecting ourselves and communities and health care workers.
Both creates things that we need in Canada and that will be necessary elsewhere around the world as well as keeping Na ii ans at work, in factories, contributing to our economic activity.



We are looking at ways of ensuring that people can stay home by attending e. supports to people who don't necessary normally qualify for them and income replacements to make sure that people don't face a choice between having to go out there and work in order to feed their family and possibly put their neighbours and themselves at risk.
We want to be able to be able to choose home.
As we said, what we announced this past week, $27 billion directly into the economy to $55 billion in deferred taxes.
We are looking now at what those next steps are to make sure that our economy is able to pick up again once we're through this, whether it takes weeks or months.
That is why supporting directly to Canadians, support directly to small businesses, to large businesses, to industry, to various sectors that will be much harder hit.
