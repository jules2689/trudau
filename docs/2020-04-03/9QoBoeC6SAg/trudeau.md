**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

happy Sunday.



**Interpreter**:

Good morning, everyone.
Thank you for joining us again today.
It has now been several weeks that public health officials have been asking Canadians to help them to slow the spread of COVID-19. We have to work from home now, cancel evenings with friends, avoid travel and gatherings.
I know that it isn't always easy to do that so I want to begin by saying thank you to all of those following the instructions.
In order to slow the spread of the virus, we must all do our part.
We must all make sacrifices in order to protect not only our own health, but those of others, that of others.
Adjustments that people are making this week are re-assuring but we must continue.



Prime Minister Trudeau's once again we thank everyone working overtime to keep us safe and keep the country moving.
Hospital staff, border ago as, store clerks, cashiers, postal workers, delivery folks, pharmacists, cleaning staff, first responders, truck drivers, train conductors and so many others.
They have been working every day so we can work from home and practice social distancing.
Thank you.
Know that all Canadians are grateful for your service.
I know that many of you are worry about what might happen next.
You are wondering how long this is going to last.
You are wondering about your job and your savings.
You're worried about your kids not being in school.
and we get it. These are uncertain times and families across the country are concerned.
That is why this week we took important steps to support Canadians, protect jobs and limb the spread of virus.
We unveiled an $82 billion plan to help people in businesses who have fallen on hard times because of COVID-19. As part of this plan, we want to boost the Canada child benefit, introduce new benefits to help people who don't qualify for employment insurance and supplement the g. S.t. Credit amonsing many other things.
Our government also announced new funding for research and new strategy to mobilize industry to fight COVID-19. After conversations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I can now confirm that the house of commons will be recalled on Tuesday at noon so we can pass emergency legislation that will put our plan into motion.
On that note, I want to thank the house leaders for their cooperation and the members of opposition for their efforts as we work together to slow the spread of this virus.
I know thating to we can protect Canadians, save jobs and set the groundwork for our economy to rebound after this crisis.




**Interpreter**:

In addition, we announced new restrictions on travel.
We temporarily closed our borders to international travelers.
We also reached an agreement with the United States to prohibit nonessential travel between our two countries.
and we will continue to encourage Canadians who are abroad to come back home.
But I know that many people are still having trouble finding a flight to return to Canada.
Yesterday, I announced that our government is working with the Canadian airlines to facilitate their return to Canada.
a first air Canada flight from morocco arrived last evening and other flights will be added.
For its par, west jet has announced that from Monday to Wednesday, more than 30 flights are planned to help Canadians return home.
Air trans at is also working with global affairs to get special permission to fly in air spaces that are now closed.
It intends to bring thousands of people back home in the coming days.
and when there are still places on sunwing, that company is offering flights home for free for those who need them.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

For more details on what we've announced so far on the government website at Canada.
Ca. Since there is more support coming this week, that is where you'll find all the information you need and the help you deserve.




We are facing an unprecedented situation and I know that many people are worried.
When you call service Canada and cannot speak to an ago or when you're abroad and cannot find a flight, I know that creates even more anxiety.
I can assure you the entire civil service is working around-the-clock to provide you with the assistance that you deserve.
From the start, we have said that we would be there for you.
We promised that our government would do everything in its power to support you.
We have come through a number of important steps in recent weeks, but you must know that the work is continuing.
We will not abandon you.
You can are lie on us.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to thank you all for helping us to slow the spread of COVID-19. For those of you who usually spend your Sundays in a place of worship, thank you for staying home today.
I know it is not easy.
But it is deeply appreciated.
and to all the kids out there.
All of a sudden you've heard you can't go on play dates or have sleepovers, your playgrounds and schools have closed and your March break was certainly different than what you'd hoped for.
I get it from My kids as well.
They're watching a whole lot more movies but they miss their friends.
At the same time, they're worried about what's going on out there in the world and what their future may hold.
I know this is a big change.
But we have to do this not just for ourselves but for our grandparents, our nurses, our doctors and everyone working at our hospitals.
and you kids are helping a lot.
The doctors and scientists have been clear that social distancing, which means staying two metres apart and at home as much as possible is the best way to help each other.
and you're having to wash your hands a lot.
So a special thanks to all you kids.
Thank you for helping your parents work from home.
For sacrificing your usual day, for doing math class around the itch kitchen table and for trusting in science.
We'll have more to say to you soon.
So, stay tuned.
In the meantime, let's make sure we all do our part.
Let's fight this together.
ment



**Interpreter**:

I'm now ready to take your questions.
Mr. Trudeau, we see on the social media a lot of photos of parks with tonnes of people.
People who don't seem to be worry about social distancing.
So, what is your message to those people and at what point would your government feel it had to crack down and bring in coercive measures? well, obviously our message to everyone is that tough stay home.
Please practice social distancing.
That is absolutely essential in other words to stop the spread of this virus and in order to protect our fellow citizens and especially those working in the health care system.
We each have an tubal to flatten the curve of this virus and protect our communities and we absolutely must do that.
We're taking measures as a country, the provinces as well, we are working with them and coordinating our efforts with respect to the next steps that may be needed.
For the time being, we continue to ask everyone and encourage everyone to stay home.
and to help our country come through this crisis.
,



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I recognize that millions of Canadians are practicing social distancing, choosing to stay home and looking for ways to keep two metres apart from each other and taking this very seriously.
That's great because this is a situation in which individual Canadians behaving responsibly will help themselves, help their neighbours and mostly protect our health care workers.
This is something we need to do together.
We're continuing to work very closely with all provinces, with different orders of government to make sure that people are understanding what they need to do and doing it. We will continue to look at possible next steps that may become necessary.
But for now, we are telling people stay home, engage in social distancing.
Protect yourselves.
Protect our system and let's get through this strongly as a country.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

It is starring to be nice outside and people are more tempted to go outside.
Don't you think it would be relevant for Ottawa to invoke the emergency measures act to prevent this kind of thing? well, I think that people are obvious lily happy to see spring coming and people can go outside.
But they must keep the proper distance from each other.
It's important to avoid any gatherings.
I think that is extremely important and we have to continue to keep our distance.
As I said, we are looking at all the tools that may be needed to keep Canadians safe.
Woe are working with the provinces.
We see what the provinces are doing at this time and we're coordinating those efforts.
Of course, if other measures are necessary, we'll take them.



**Reporter**:

Encouraging people to stay home and to social distance is not enough.
There is mounting evidence of social media, pictures of people packing on the Beach's in Vancouver, for example.
Why not invoke something stricter like the emergencies act.
Why not restrict people's civil liberties to protect their health?



Prime Minister Trudeau's there are many things that are being done and can be done at the local level, the municipal level and at the provincial level.
It is a step where the regulations available to the federal government do not respond or are insufficient to respond to the situation at hand.
We continue to work very closely with provinces, with other jurisdictions, to make sure that they are able to do the things that need to be done.
and it's niece to move nor ward with the emergencies act.



Your party took down a public appeal to fund raise for the liberal party.
Why was that taken down and what did you do about it?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I can't speak for that decision.
Obviously this is a situation in which Canadians Na ed to pull together.
We need to be there to support each other.
We need to make sure we're using all different methods to connect and pass important messages to Canadians to make sure we know how to stay safe and we're properly protecting ourselves and communities and health care workers.
I know that everyone needs to use whatever methods of communications they have.
But it's not a situation for fundraising.



**Reporter**:

Hi, it is Annie bergeron-oliver with CTV national news.
Companies across Canada say they are able to retool and ramp up production but they need assurances from the federal government.
Will your government guarantee that it will buy supplies like masks and ventilators if companies start producing them immediately? [banging]



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

That is very much part of our industrial strategy that we just announced to get companies across the country to manufacture essential equipment, whether it's ventilators or masks or gowns.
We've already had a tremendous positive response from companies.
Both creates things that we need in Canada and that will be necessary elsewhere around the world as well as keeping Na ii ans at work, in factories, contributing to our economic activity.
These are things that we're going to continue to do and we can assure companies that produce these things that we need them and we will use them.



**Reporter**:

is that a yes that companies that are producing them immediately will have their purchases -- their products purchased? and two, are you considering any incentives to keep people home?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are looking at ways of ensuring that people can stay home by attending e. I. supports to people who don't necessary normally qualify for them and income replacements to make sure that people don't face a choice between having to go out there and work in order to feed their family and possibly put their neighbours and themselves at risk.
We want to be able to be able to choose home.



**Reporter**:

Brian Mullen at the global news.
I have a question about economic aid for Canadians.
Denmark has a very aggressive plan, paying about 75% of people's salaries to avoid mass layoffs and let them keep their jobs and encourage them to stay home.
Basically freezing their economy in the hopes that it will eventually thaw out with less damage in the long run.
Did your government can this option and rule it out?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we have not ruled out anything.
As I said, we put forward a significant package of $27 billion directly into the economy, to support workers, to support small businesses.
But that was only the initial phase of what is necessary.
We're continuing to talk about next steps.
Looking at best practices from around the world, looking at what other countries and jurisdictions are doing to ensure that our economy remains solid if, at a standstill, so it can pick up again once this crisis is through.



and a question about personal pro eke thieve equipment.
Not just for front line hospital staff, but for other essential workers.
Once the virus ramps up, people will burn through it fast.
Do we have what we need now? are you bringing in shipments right now from other countriesings including china?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we're confident in our capacity to ramp up to provide protective equipment for frontline hospital staff and others who need it so importantly.
This is something that Canada has been working towards for a while now.
We will ensure that the equipment is available for those who need it right across the country.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I hope your family is doing as well as can be in seconders es like every other person in Canada.
Just picking up on My colleague's question about freezing the economy.
It seems to be a fairly significant move by a number of countries.
Can you share with us your views and your government's views about taking this approach in I've talked this morning to several business leaders and they're all concerned that this economy will go into a stale -- into a tail spin and they think it would be good for the government to push funding through them to their employees rather than seeing another week of 500, 000 or one million Canadian apply to e. Ism and overwhelming your government's resources to process those application and then again to fill in more paperwork to apply for their jobs.
Can you tell us and maybe go into more detail about your thinking about this approach? it seems to be the thought leadership that everyone is looking at in the last couple of days.



Prime Minister Trudeau's we've been listening and speaking with business leaders in this country, top employers, small business groups representatives across the country to hear their ideas on how to move forward.
We've been listening to opposition leaders making different suggestions as well.
I can tell you that nothing is off the table.
I can also tell you that there is no one measure that is going to be sufficient to get us through this situation.
We are going to need to bring in many different measures that have different impacts on employers, on employees, on workers, on families, on vulnerable Canadians, on Canadians of all sorts of different challenges and situations.
In order to be able to hold strong through this time of economic stoppage of so much activity so that we can then, as we're through this, pick up without having lost too much or anything and without too much delay.
Yes, it is obvious that companies that are able to keep people on the payroll longer will find it easier to not have to rehire later and that is certainly something that we're looking at. It's something that we've taken steps already towards with the payroll credit.
But there is more to do and these are the things that we're absolutely looking at. But like I said, there is no one silver bullet.
It is going to be many, many different measures brought together in the most efficient way that will help us through this.



**Reporter**:

and what guidance can you give employers and Canadians about the last containment phase that will shift gears to a more targeted containment where people can return to work.
Will it be weeks, months or several courses?



Prime Minister Trudeau's that is a question for scientists fn obviously we're taking the best advice from top researchers around the world.
We are looking at the track of the spread of the disease.
In china, in places like south korea, in places like taiwan and singapore.
Looking at the challenges facing europe and particularly italy right now.
and trying to make sure that we're taking the best possible decisions here in Canada.
We know that self-isolation and social distancing is going to be extremely important in the coming weeks.
We're going to have to maintain it. We also know that testing on a much larger scale is going to be very important, which is why we're ramping up the amount of tests done by tens of thousands of every single day.
We'll continue to look to do exactly what we need to do in the time it takes.
I wish anyone could give a date at which point this will all be behind us, but that really depends not just on what we do today, but what we keep doing tomorrow and into next week and into next month and that is why we all need to be working together to get through this as I know Canadians will.



Thank you.
We'll go to the phone for a few questions.
One question and a quick follow-up. Moderator?



**Caller**:

Thank you.
Merci.
The next question is from your line is open.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Reporter**:

Pardonemoi.




**Interpreter**:

Doctors and business people are asking you for more strict and coercive measures to make sure that people stay home.
Can you please tell us why you don't think the time has come to order people to stay home? well, we recognize that at the municipal and provincial levels, they are already taking measures to restrict movement even more.
and that is what we're recommending.
But in order for the federal government to do that, we would have to be at a stage where we have really gone far beyond what can be done at the provincial level and there is a need for emergency measures at the federal level to provide those powers.
We are not at that stage yet.
But we are looking very carefully at the situation to see if that will be needed.



The next question, please.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
We talked about flights to help people in Spain and other countries.
When will people -- when will flights be available to bring those Canadians home? I can tell you that global affairs working directly with the governments in Peru and Spain and right around the world to ensure that we have access to airports so that flights can take off when the air space is closed.
We need permission in order to do that.
and we are hopeful that we can make announcements on that very, very soon.
I understand there are many Canadians who are waiting to see when those planes are going to arrive and we're working very, very hard to bring these people home as soon as possible.
But I'm asking people to be patient.
So is it a question of days a week? it's a question of days.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

and you also said yesterday that you find it regrettable that some people will not be able to come home.
What are you saying to people who are stranded in Peru and who are ill and cannot board a flight and who are now in difficult conditions? what do you say to the families of those people who are stranded? as I said a few days ago and as I reminded people yesterday, there are three million people at all times that are outside the country.
Now obviously everyone will not be able to or want to necessarily come back home.
Now if some people have to remain where they are, they will need to self-isolate and we can provide assistance in the form of money through global affairs.
But we're asking you to register on the website, travel.
Gc. Ca. We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.
But unfortunately we're dealing with a global crisis that is unprecedented and we don't necessarily have all the tools we need to help everyone as we would like to. But we'll definitely try to help everyone we can and that is what global affairs is working on right now with the canadian airlines and other countries to try and bring home as many Canadians as possible.



Last question.



Thank you.
Merci.
 the last question is from Reuters Ottawa.
Your line is open.



Prime Minister Trudeau's david, you might be on mute as well.



**Reporter**:

Good grief.
and I was sending a tweet mocking another colleague.
[laughter]ok.



Prime Minister Trudeau's you're live now, david, so you can ask your question.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
You talked about the next weeks of social isolation.
But patty hajdu, your health Minister said today that we're talking about months, not weeks.
This is surely a need to keep from the come from freezing over months rather than weeks and surely means that you have to boost your reaction and the fiscal stimulus plan will be bigger than the $27 billion you've announced.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Yes.
As we said, what we announced this past week, $27 billion directly into the economy to $55 billion in deferred taxes.
These are only a very first step.
We are looking now at what those next steps are to make sure that our economy is able to pick up again once we're through this, whether it takes weeks or months.
It is likely to take months before we're fully through this.
That is why supporting directly to Canadians, support directly to small businesses, to large businesses, to industry, to various sectors that will be much harder hit.
These are things we are busy looking at in order so that once we move through this, we are age to get back to where we were before as quickly as possible.



**Reporter**:

Great.
Thank you.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

I recognize that what we did last week, the $27 billion in direct support, the $55 billion in deferral of taxes, that that will be a first step toward helping people.
But, of course, there are other things we'll have to do. Whether it is directly for small business and large industries or for workers and families.
We know that the idea will be to come through this situation and during this period of extreme slowdown in the economy so that we can ramp up our economic activity as soon as possible afterwards.
This is a difficult situation.
and it will require multiple solutions.
and this is work we'll all do together.
But we will do it and we will come through thising to as Canadians.
Thank you.
and have a great Sunday.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada addressing Canadians for the seventh day in a row here about his government's measures to try to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and also to try to make sure that the economy doesn't collapse essentially over the next weeks and months.
The big news, of course, from the Prime Minister today is that parliament will, indeed, be reconvening on Tuesday to approve some emergency measures.
It is an extraordinary move and it will happen at an extraordinary pace.
For more on that and reaction to what the government has been doing the past few weeks, we invited the leader of the official opposition Andrew Scheer on to the programme.
Thank you for joining us.



Thank you for having me on.



**Rosemary**:

Let's start with parliament being recalled on Tuesday.
Are there any concerns from your party around how quickly this has to happen and the measures proposed by the government?



**Andrew Scheer**:

Well, we support the notion of getting assistance out to Canadians as quickly as possible.
We've all heard stories of people who are going through extreme hardship or you're worried about how they will make their mortgage payment, their rent, pay their utilitieses.
So, we're supportive of the government -- of the house coming back very quickly and passing these measures quickly.
We believe that there needs to be more done.
We have been calling on the government to do more for workers who are affected by retail stores and restaurants ordered to close.
As well as for those small businesses themselves.
We asked for the government to refund the g. S.t. That they've collected from the past six months at least as well as increasing the wage subsidy to keep more people employed during this difficult time.



**Rosemary**:

We have seen the Prime Minister be asked about a shoring up of income.
Sort of a universal basic income or further than that in some countries.
Would that be something that you would support? do you think it's something that the government needs to consider? certainly the Prime Minister suggested it's possible going forward.
But it's not something that they're doing yet.



Well, what we want to make sure is that the assistance is done in a target and time lien maer.
This is going to be a very difficult period for people with the next few weeks at least and well beyond in terms of economic effects.
So, we would want to see any assistance be directly linked to this pandemic and it would have a timeline that would be appropriate in terms of making sure that it exists while people are still suffering the outcomes or impacts of the pan em thick.
That is our position that relief should be targeted and last for as long as noded.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister and the government are considering the emergencies act, if kneed.
Obviously the jurisdictions have the different measures to enforce how people are behaving.
We saw that if Nova Scotia today.
There still seems to be problems with Canadians following instructions.
Would you be supportive of using that measure, which is essentially the new version of the war measures act.



**Eddie**:

At this time, I haven't seen the evidence presented for the need for that.
This is a fluid situation and levels of government are responding as best they can.
The existing tools that are there for municipalities and provincial levels of government and of course the federal government are being used.
I think at this time that is where we should be focusing on. You know, we're still kind of looking at the full ramification of this pandemic.
We're still trying to deal with people who are suffering catastrophic drops in personal income and revenue for small businesses.
Of course, we're learning more about how the virus spreads and what can be done in terms of testing.
That is where the focus needs to be in the short-term.
Of course, you know, our role, our position going forward is to be one of a constructive opposition.
We're here to hold the government to account and ensure that tough questions are being asked.
When they make decisions or decide not to do something, it is our job to raise that.
We want to be a -- to have a cooperative relationship with the government at this point in time but still advocating for Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

That is a bit of a I shhh, if I'm not mistaken.
The conservative party has decided to dial down the partisan rhetoric over the past 10 days in order to be constructive.
Was that intentional?



**Eddie**:

It is acknowledge.
-- acknowledgment of the fact that we're all fighting this together and we're trying to be supportive of each other in our communities.
It is a difficult time for everyone.
People staying home for days at a time.
People haven't been able to go to work.
We are recognizing that this is an a unprecedented situation for this government.
At the same time, you know, it is our job to point out some of the things that haven't always been clear and consistent to Canadians.
Just last week, Justin Trudeau's was saying that travel bans don't work.
That closing the border doesn't work.
Restricting travel doesn't work.
We pushed on that and a few days later, a change was made.
We saw public safety Minister bill Blair say that people who are coming into Canadian airports would be subjected to screening and then we saw people take to Twitter to show pictures and say that wasn't happening.
So we raised those concerns and we're still advocating for a better response to this pandemic but doing so in a way that I hope it instills confidence in Canadians that our institutions will work and also hold the government to account and ensure they're asking those types of questions.



**Rosemary**:

Finally, Erin o'toole, one of people vying for the job of leader of the conservative party today, called for the ration -- race to be suspended.
What are your thoughts on that? are you prepared to stay on beyond June if needed? it does seem pretty strange that the race is continuing given these extraordinary times that we're in.



**Eddie**:

Ultimately that is a decision by the leadership committee of our council.
I'll respect whatever decision they make.
The situation has changed dramatically in the last week.
It's hard to imagine that just a little over a week ago everyone was still moving about and going about their daily routine quite normally.
I'm sure that our national councillors and members of that committee are listening.
and I know that they're taking this decision very seriously and I'm -- I'll leave it to them to make a final decision.



**Rosemary**:

You're in Regina right now.
I'm not sure if you are going to make it back to Ottawa for the recalling of parliament.
Just how are you doing? how is your family doing? not sure if they're with you.
How are you coping personally?



**Eddie**:

Yeah, well, thank you.
We went home to Regina for the March break and this is where we were when the music stopped so to speak.
So, we've been at home.
Five kids kind of indoors mostly.
It is a little bit of a challenge.
But I know it is a challenge for every family right now.
In the first few days, the kids were just excited about the prospect of school not coming back.
So we're trying to get them to read a bit more and making up indoor games.
I've been spend ago lot of time on the phone with My colleagues and members of My team, a lot of conference calls making sure that our members of parliament are up to date with the latest information from government as well as My own constituents in regina-q'appelle.
We've had people call about wanting to apply for the new programmes and people with loved ones overseas.
I've been busy and a lot fewer face-to-face meeting and more work over the phone.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Glad to hear that.
Really important to get you on the airwaves, especially if parliament is not sitting.
Very important to hear opposition's voice.
Thank you very much.



**Eddie**:

Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

That was Andrew Scheer, of course, leader of the official opposition.
He was in Regina.
Let me go back to David Cochrane, listening in on the Prime Minister's press conference, to highlight a couple of the things that I guess you thought were important there as we stand by and wait for ministers, David.



**Reporter**:

There were five newsy thing there that I would point to. One is that parliament opens on Tuesday at noon for a greatly diminished all-party, nonpartisan session to pass the aid package to resfonld this.
Westjet has 30 flights ready to help with repatriation and those will start flying Monday to Wednesday.
Over the next three days, we'll see westjet bring a serious number of Canadians home.
We don't know precisably where they will go. But 30 planes from west jet are on the way.
and others are seeking permission to fly internationally and sunwing is trying to use the empty seats on its planes to bring Canadians home.
The Prime Minister is not ruling out more restrictions on movement.
Social media has shown us pictures of people socializing in a way that is quite dangerous in an era of social distancing.
It seems like the approach is to let municipalities and provincial governments put those tougher restrictions in place.
and that is certainly what's happening as province by province seems to be diminishing the amount of gatherings.
and the acknowledgment that the $82 billion aid package is only the first start.
It's kind of the emergency room medicine to stop the bleeding.
The surgery and rehabilitation needs to come.
and we heard a really interesting idea, rosey from the "globe and mail" in this question, they are suggesting why doesn't the government send it to companies and let the companies send it to people because we see with the I. T. systems and diminished civil service, it's tough for the government to be the payroll department for the entire country.
So piggy back on the existing payroll companies.
So building on what we're seeing and the announcement on Friday with the new industrial policy of Canada of tilting manufacturering toward making the medical supplis that we need and now stepping up to be the human resources domestic for the federal government is overwhelmed to make sure people get money in their banks as quickly as possible.



**Rosemary**:

It is an interesting idea.
One more comment on the repatriation flights.
The Prime Minister did say more in the days ahead.
Sunwing, you mentioned.
But they plan to bring 5, 000 customers home today on about 30 flights.
But they suspend operations tomorrow.
So things are starting to slow down in a lot of places as well and, you know, there's still opportunity to get home.
Let me end on the emergencies act, which I know we seem hung up on as journalist.
We ask about a it every day.
But essentially it is the war measures act.
Renewed form created in the mid 1980s and hasn't been used yet.
But essentially it is, just so people understand, if provinces are not doing enough or if provinces say they need help, I wonder if there are sort of backroom conversations about what the provinces are doing and what they're heading towards.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
There are daily and consistent conversations with the provinces on what they need in their health departments and what they need for basic income support.
You are seeing more and more, rosey, Nova Scotia says anyone who comes in, you have to self-isolate.
Newfoundland and Labrador did that already, and so did Prince Edward Island and the Northwest Territories saying nobody can come in for any nonessential travel.
So you are seeing restrictions at provincial borders that, until the last couple of days have been reserved for international borders.
I think they have been very cautious to not look like a government that is attacking the basic civil liberties of people in one of world east best democracies.
But the social media images over the weekend have shaken the mood in a big way.
As premiers and mayors are moving to these extreme measures, it become a question of how long ottawa can hold out and what you are seeing with lessons learned from places like italy there needs to be one, clear, loud, consistent message.
Right now the Prime Minister has that platform.
and it is on a much bigger level than stephen mcneil has in Nova Scotia or dwight ball has in newfoundland or labrador.
These are going to be questions that will continue to be asked and if people keep, you know, disobeying or defying these regulations, to go to the beach or go to a playground and play street hockey in numbers greater than five or two, depending ton province you're in, the pressure will continue for the Prime Minister to look at this in a serious way.
They said all along they will not do this without consulting with other parties and with the provinces.
The need for those consultations seems to be ramping up.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for that.
We're standing by for cabinet ministers to speak to us again today.
and David will be back for that.
Let me show you a little bit of what Stephen McNeil did have to say today.
Responding really to the fact that while some people are listening in Nova Scotia to the need for self-isolation and social distancing, others are really not.
So the province took some extreme measures today.



Today, I need to focus on those who are not following public health advice.
Over the weekend, I saw and heard a far too many incidents of people gathering, blatantly disregarding the social and physical distance rules of staying six feet or two metres apart.
Moneys gathering on our beaches and in our parks.
Large groups of peoplecongregating.
Young people playing streethockey.
Cars parked everywhere.
People disregarding lawenforcement.
We are dealing with a deadly virus and this behaviour isunacceptable.
Today, effective immediately, I'm declaring a provincial state of emergency.
Minister porter is here to explain what that means and minister furry is here to explain how we will enforce it. We are also reducing the size of gatherings effectiveimmediately.
People cannot gather in groups of more than five.
You can still go outside but you walk to exercise, not to associatize.
Stay in your neighbourhood.
Walk around the block or down the street.
Our provincial parks areclosed.
If you go there, you are trespassing and your vehicle swill be towed.
You can get groceries, you can go to the pharmacy, but do not do it in packs.
Identify a single family member who can do those errands and if you are an individual helpingneighbours, please continue to do so.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That was Stephen McNeil, the premier of nova scotiaannouncing ramp ed up measures as we're starting to see across the country.
Shaina luck is in Halifax now.
The premier almost seemed to be, you know a little -- I don't know if angry is the right word -- but very frustrated that people were not following public health advice.



**Reporter**:

That's right.
Certainly the premier has told us a couple of times earlier in the week that he didn't think a state of emergency was required.
That all changed this morning.
The premier told us, as you heard in that clip, that this was due to what we'd seen over the weekend.
This is a very sunny, spring weekend.
Yesterday certainly on Saturday, we saw many people posting on social media how crowded can our beaches were, and how crowded the parks were.
We saw I have yo es on social media of hundreds of cars parked in the parking lots of those recreational places.
and that is why the premier told us today that he had decided to move to the state of emergency, limiting the number of people who can gather together to five, no more than five, and the province is bringing in as well fines and the ability for law enforcement to potentially arrest people if they're found to be in violation of self-isolation or social distancing.
We're told the police have l have the ability to fine $1, 000 for an individual and that can accumulate for multiple days.
Businesss can face even more, $7500.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Shaina luck, thank you.
Just to leave you with the latest that we have from the Prime Minister before we bring you the cabinet Minister's press conference on CBC news network, the Prime Minister saying the house of commons will be recalled on Tuesday at noon to pass extraordinary measures to help Canadians stay afloat.
He also had a nice message for kids saying hang in there.
Time to say good-bye to those of you watching on cbc television.
Except in Manitoba.
You'll be with us for the next half hour.
[please stand by]
