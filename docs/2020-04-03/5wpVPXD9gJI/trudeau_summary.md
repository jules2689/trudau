### Summary:



I want to start this morning by wishing everyone a happy Sikh heritage month.
To our farmers and truckers, to the people delivering air cargo, to nurses and doctors, you are working 24/7 so we can eat and take our medications.


[end of translation] our government has introduced a three-point economic plan to protect jobs, help people laid off, and support businesses.
If you're worried about your job, we're helping your employerkeep you on the payroll with thecanada emergency wage subsidy.
Later today Minister morneau, Minister ng, and Minister Bains will provide an update about this 75% wage subsidy.
Employers will need to attest that they're doing everything they can to pay the remaining 25% of people's wages.
These are unprecedented times and will require us to pull together as a country and trust each other as Canadians.
So there will be stiff and severe penalties for trying to take advantage of this system and of your fellow Canadians.
 

[voice of interpreter] -- wage subsidy is there for small and large companies that are not publicly funded and have seen a 30% decline in their revenues.
Employers who use that subsidy have to do everything in their power to pay the remaining 25% of workers' wages.
We have to pull together as a country and trust each other there will be very stiff and severe penalties for anyone who tries to take advantage of the system and fellow Canadians.


[end of translation] these are unprecedented times so we're taking unprecedented action.
While we put this measure in place, we're continuing to move forward on the other two prongs of our economic plan, to help business owners worried about rent or other bills, we've brought in new loans.
To help people who lose their paycheque, whether freelance or laid off, we created the Canada emergency response benefit.
 

[voice of interpreter] starting on April 6, if you have not yet applied for employment insurance, you can apply online to receive the Canada emergency response benefit.
But if you are receiving the wage subsidy, you cannot receivethe emergency response benefit.
You can apply by visiting Canada.
Ca when you apply, you can receive your benefit by mailor direct deposit.
Again, if you have already applied for employment insurance, you do not need to register starting on April 6. We are also taking measures to prevent the system to be overloaded by applications.
Later today Minister Duclos and Minister qualtrough will have more details to share about the process and eligibility criteria.


[end of translation] you will be able to apply for the Canada emergency response benefit.
a reminder, if you're getting the wage subsidy from your employer, you can't collect the CERB.
You can't get both of these benefits.
For the CERB, you can register online at Canada.
If you can't apply online, don'tworry, you can call the Canada revenue agency for help over thephone.
After applying all you have to do to keep getting this benefit is to check in every month to say that you're still out of work. We're putting measures in place so we don't overload the system, but I can assure you everyone will get their money.
Later today Minister Duclos and Minister qualtrough will have more details on the process fromeligibility to getting your cheque. We have a plan to protect jobs, to help those laid off, and to support businesses that are having cash flow problems.
This is the largest economic program in Canada's history.
This must be a team Canada effort.
Canada hasn't seen this type of civic mobilization since the second world war.
These historic measures will support Canadians to stay home to defeat COVID-19.
