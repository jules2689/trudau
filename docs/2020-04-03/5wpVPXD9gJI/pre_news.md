Ca. We are awaiting Justin trudeau'sdaily pandemic briefing.
We are expecting him to speak at11:30 eastern, so a little later than usual, but we will bring that to you as soon as he comes out of his home, Rideau cottage, to tell you how the government is responding to COVID-19. The leader of the official opposition, Andrew Scheer, criticized the response so far saying the response has been full of confusion and delays.
We will also look at what Toronto is doing to toughen up measures after some stark warnings from the public health officer in Toronto.
As we look live, we are waiting for the Prime Minister to speak around 11:30. First let me bring in My colleagues, "power & politics" host Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
Let's talk about what we expect to hear from the government today.



**Vassy**:

a couple of things.
The Prime Minister will focus on the wage subsidy.
That's the announcement the government made late last week about a 75% subsidy for businesses, now we know it's fora business of any size.
We don't know what a business will need to qualify.
Specifically, the prime minister has indicated on Monday I think it was that the business would have to show a 30% reduction in revenue in the wake of this pandemic.
That would be a qualifying factor.
There are still a lot of questions.
We were going to get the answers from the finance Minister, bill morneau.
That didn't happen.
My understanding is the Prime Minister will reveal some of that.
There are questions about the CERB, that's the pile of money that will help individuals, $2, 000 a month up to four months, an alternative to e. I. if you've lost your job or have to stay home because of COVID-19. There are some questions if you have to have lost all of your income.
Qualifying questions there too.
I am expecting some of those details to be provided by the Prime Minister once again.
But set against the backdrop of what you said there coming from Toronto, stricter measures in Toronto.
That is overarching what we're hearing from the federal government to questions about how strict these measures should be at a country-wide level.
How should we be interpreting the health officer for toronto says we need to be strict for the next three months.
Canadians are interested to knowat a national level what that means for them.



**Rosemary**:

We heard from British Columbia that they expect this to go well into summertime, end of summertime.
We certainly heard from the city of Toronto today saying that these new measures put in place will last about three months.
and I guess everyone is preoccupied with that notion, understandably so. We saw some fairly strict measures from qu√âbec.
They're putting their provincial police around the province as well as on the bridges to make sure there's not much traffic back and forth.
There's lots of things going on that indicate a tightening up of public health measures, but also laying the groundwork for a longer period of time than maybe people are ready to contemplate now.
David, over to you.



**David**:

Rosie, people need to start contemplating that.
Right from day one when the aid packages were announced, one thing that hasn't changed is they were for 14 or 15 weeks.
That should give you an idea what the government is anticipating.
The short-term fallout of this as the economy is put in this medically induced coma.
Now there are new enforcement restrictions to try to slow the spread and stop the health system from being completely overwhelmed.
I think it's quite clear or should be clear to people that this is not a quick fix but a temporary solution.
It's short in a life cycle, but not in the immediate time frame.
Schools closed in Ontario until May 4 and in other places indefinitely.
I think people have to wrap their heads around the idea thatwe may not send our kids back to the academic system for the restof the year.
That's where it's trending.
We need answers to business groups, from small, big, and thetech sector, people asking what does it mean for me, what about the g. S.t., what about, what about, what about.
We need answers to the what abouts.
There are companies with hundreds of thousands of employees with no clear clarity how that works.
Some of that is unavoidable because the government of Canada's essentially rolling out massive-scale adjustments to payroll in 72. The other question is do they have to go back to the house of commons to get approval to do this.
This is the position of the conservatives that they think they have to recall parliament and get the senate back.
I'm not sure what the tolerance is for that kind of a parliamentary delay for the wider public, but it is traditional in a westminster system, but in terms of the needfor cash, that's not going away.



**Rosemary**:

I want to talk about some of the most vulnerable Canadians that are getting hit the hardest and that is not surprisingly seniors' homes across the province dealing with outbreaks, some of them more tragic and severe depending on where you are.
Certainly that is the case at Ontario's pine crest nursing home in bobcaygeon.
It is a huge concern.
The home has one of the deadliest outbreaks, they're up to 13 deaths.
Dr. Steven aldridge is an attending physician there.
Thank you for making the time for us.



**Interview**:

Good morning.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me what is the latest on this situation from the pine crest nursing home from what you know.



**Interview**:

We're going to be getting daily updates.
The medical director will be up at 4:00. We're going to release the numbers.
This is a devastating illness.
I can't describe just how quickly these people become sick.
I think the message that needs to get out is there is no vaccine, we have no effective treatment or supportive care for these folks and obviously there is no cure.
So when the infection takes hold in their lungs in this elderly population, we can just make them comfortable.
Realistically a ventilator is not an option for reasons the experts can point to. It's heart-breaking.



**Rosemary**:

It is so prevalent in this nursing home.
We've seen outbreaks in other parts of the country, in the lower mainland in British Columbia.
But it is so devastating because of the age of the patients and you can't contain where they are.
What is your assessment?



**Interview**:

It's both.
They are the most vulnerable in our population.
We knew this as it was approaching our country.
It's difficult to contain in these nursing homes.
This is a home, not a hospital.
We're not set up for isolation to the extent a hospital can offer.
We do our best.
Once it gets into one of these buildings, it's difficult to contain.



**Rosemary**:

Do you have the resources that you need at the nursing home? I understand it is supposed to be a residential environment and not a medical environment.



**Interview**:

We're getting support from public health.
One of the biggest problems is public health is operating on a reduced staff prior to this pandemic.
We can do more from a public health standpoint to manage these sorts of outbreaks.
We need to be anticipating this sort of thing.
I don't blame public health certainly, but I do think we can do more in containment efforts than what we've been able to do.



**Rosemary**:

I understand many of the workers have also gotten sick.
How is that affecting the capacity to help the older people in the home?



**Interview**:

Well, for the first several days, it was very, very difficult.
We had people not coming for shifts and other staff staying for double shifts who were already exhausted.
We're better now.
Local organizations and the province has stepped-up to bringin extra help from outside.
The home was overwhelmed.
Our staff, our p. S.w. S are stressed.
They were stressed before the pandemic.
They don't have enough time to provide care.
I think they're underpaid significantly.
You throw on a pandemic and thisjust shows and displays the weaknesses to this underfunded healthcare system that we're forced to work in. We can do better.



**Rosemary**:

There's no one coming in and out of the home.
We've seen that across the country and people struggling to stay in touch with their family members.
How are the residents who are there, even those that are not sick, how are they managing being so isolated?



**Interview**:

To be honest, I don't know.
I can't imagine what it must be like for them.
It must be frightening.
They can't get their family in. We have people at the windows putting up pictures and waving and the like to give support, but it must be horrible for them having to restrict visitors as we have been, but we have no choice.



**Rosemary**:

You're an attendingphysician, a family physician.
This is not the type of work that you normally would do. How are you coping with this?



**Interview**:

Well, I'm not getting a lot of sleep.
Some of these family conversations are just gut-wrenching.
You lay awake repeating in My mind what these folks are going through and trying to support the families.
I've been doing family medicine for 30 years in the nursing homes for all of that period.
I've never had so many deaths insuch a short time.
I've been influenza epidemics going through the homes and losta patient or two, but nothing like what is at pinecrest.



**Rosemary**:

Can you tell me a little bit without getting too personal about those gut-wrenching conversations, howyou even start that conversation.



**Interview**:

I'll get the news.
One of My patients died this morning.
I spoke with the granddaughter and had to explain that her grandmother was elderly and we provided supportive care.
We did.
She was comfortable to the end and passed this morning.
It's frustrating.
As a doctor, you want to do more and help.
I'm getting all these e-mails and facebook messages from people.
I had one this morning suggesting all types of things, I've had hot lemonade recommended.
We don't have a proven cure for this disease.
There is no anti-viral as of yetthat is effective.
I take My lead from the experts.
I'm just a family doctor.



**Rosemary**:

So we would now be up to 13 deaths of residents in the home from what you understand?



**Interview**:

Well, I will leave the official number to the end of the day.
I told you mine for illustration, but you can expect more deaths.
This isn't going to stop.



**Rosemary**:

Are you faced in terms of when you go in and your personal protective equipment, do you feel that you are equipped to visit the homes?



**Interview**:

That's a good point.
There is a severe shortage of personal protective equipment.
I was in the home the morning we found out the outbreak we were dealing with was COVID-19. I was immediately self-isolated and had some respiratory symptoms and was on quarantine until I got My results five dayslater.
I've been advised since that I should only go in if there is anemergency.
I haven't been back to the home, but I have access to the patients' charts on My computer remotely.
I speak with the nurses by phone.
We are just offering palliative care and we can do that remotely.
I would like to be in and at their bedsides.
It breaks me up.



**Rosemary**:

What worries you the most outside of this particular centre in terms of the pandemic across the country?



**Interview**:

I'm worried about the other 24 nursing homes in bobcaygeon that have COVID-19 in their home.
The health unit will have to work extra hard to contain this and hope it doesn't get through the home.
The best treatment for this virus is prevention, avoidance.
Restrict visitors and contain this as best we can.
Pine crest is an example of how bad it can be and get.
We need to learn from the example and contain this as best we can.
I have heard recommendations to take family members out of the facilities, if you can care for them at home, do so. It's certainly a safer place for them than being confined.



**Rosemary**:

Doctor, I know medical professionals never like to feel like they're doing heroic work, but it is times like this that you are.
I can see that you're struggling through it, but I think it's so important for you to speak to people.
Thank you for doing that.



**Interview**:

Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Stay safe and healthy.
That was Dr. Steven aldridge from the pine crest nursing home in bobcaygeon.
Obviously this is the difficult part of this from a health perspective.
These are the populations that are going to be hardest hit in this country, the people that have underlying conditions or of course are older and vulnerable.
As you heard there from the doctor, in places where they really are stuck.
So that makes it very easy for the virus to spread.
Something to keep in mind every time we hear from public health officials about how important Otis to stay home.
The other part of the story, the other big challenge, is the economic fallout from all of this because it is a health story as well as an economic story, about how this country is coping at a time when the economy is for all intents and purposes shut down.
We know that the Canadian government has announced that 75% wage subsidy and we are expecting to hear a few more details today, both from the Prime Minister who we are waiting for, and the finance Minister and Minister of small business and innovation.
They are speaking at 2:00 p. M. in Toronto.



> let me go to a small business owner joining me from Georgetown, Ontario.



**Interview**:

Good morning, thank you.



**Rosemary**:

What have you heard there from the government that you think might be of help for you.
I would imagine that your school is closed?



**Interview**:

Yes, we were mandated to close as of March 17.



**Rosemary**:

What have you heard from the federal government or the provincial government that you think might be of help to you?



**Interview**:

Well, as of right now -- initially our staff were placed on e. I. because that was the initial response because it was a few weeks ago.
We will be following up in terms of whether or not it would be better maintain e. I. or if this wage subsidy will support -- we still have to learn as to what to do next.
I'm always trying to keep on top of these things, but we will follow up to do what's best for our employees.



**Rosemary**:

For now what have you done for your employees, have they been laid off, applied for e. I., or how many employees do you have?



**Interview**:

We have just under30 employees.
Most of them are full time.
We were placed on e. I. on March 17 because we weren't able to open March 17.



**Rosemary**:

Would you consider hiring them back, as the government has suggested, to try to maintain that employer-employee connection andtapping into this 75% wage subsidy if you are able?



**Interview**:

If we are able to, yes.
In terms of the stipulations that we need to show a 30% reduction in revenue, well we have zero revenue.
We're not collecting fees.
We need to learn more details at this point.
It's not that we wouldn't mind, as owners, doing the work for the employees and processing it. It's just a matter of learning more about eligibility and the process.



**Rosemary**:

So I imagine you have no revenue coming in. The Prime Minister talked about businesses that could top up rfp75% to 100%, in your case would that be possible?



**Interview**:

We have zero revenue.
We can't pay fixed expenses, so we wouldn't have revenue to top-up anything.



**Rosemary**:

You talk about fixed expenses, that's a concerntoo, about how to pay bills and rents or leases.
Are you looking into one of these interest-free loans?



**Interview**:

Right, there is a $40, 000 interest-free loan that we may be eligible for.
We will be applying for it, so that will help with the expenses.
Today alone it's not all of our fixed expenses, but today alone we're making payments of $21, 000with no revenue.
That's not even all the fixed expenses for the month.
So yes, we are applying for the loan to see if it would be some help.
It's just a challenge because atthe end of the day even loans ordeferred payments, anything likethat obviously is a challenge to be paid in the future.
As a child care centre, our expenses are very high on a goodday.
So then pay -- when we hopefullycan get back to normal, that dollar that is going to be paid will not only have to pay that existing month's expenses, but also the deferred payments from now.



**Rosemary**:

So reasonably, how long could you go on like this? we are now thinking of timelines that are three, four months out.



**Interview**:

At most, stretching, two months, really stretching, really stretching.
It's -- the Prime Minister indicated yesterday that he didn't want people to be coming out of this with an impossible amount of debt.
I can respect those words, but statement if this lasts more than a couple months I really don't see how that's even possible.



**Rosemary**:

How are you coping in terms of your stress and dealing with this mentally? because that's a lot.



**Interview**:

So trying to manage a household with My husband and keeping our kids busy.
I don't have toddlers around My ankles, but teenagers are helping out.
Between me and My sister to try to help out our parents as well so they don't go out.
We're doing the best we can in the situation.
The stress level is beyond imaginable, but we're healthy and there's other people out there that are not healthy and everyone's health is important.
We understand why funding has been focused on individual families and people in the community.
There's no dispute there.
We can completely appreciate that.
We know funding is going where it needs to be going.
It's just a challenge to be able to manage now.
It's very overwhelming to be able to manage now and still to be there in a couple of months for our parents to return back to us because they need to get back to work and the spots need to be there for their kids.



**Rosemary**:

I know you're coping as well as you can.
I know the finance Minister has more answers later today at 2:00p.
M. eastern.
Tune in and we'll see how you'redoing in a few weeks.
That was Danielle purves, a co-owner of a montessori school in Ontario.
We have a few minutes before theprime Minister comes out -- oh, we will listen in now to the Prime Minister.
