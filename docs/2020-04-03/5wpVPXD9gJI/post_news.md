That is our federal wrap of press conferences by the Prime Minister and deputy Prime Minister and other health officials today.
a couple of bits of news for everyone to keep inmind.
Parliament will be recalled in the days ahead to deal with what the government is qualifying as the biggest economicprogramme a government ha sever put in place.
and that has do could with the wage subsidy and the emergency relief benefit.
The other piece of news you should keep in mind, that portal, that website, if you qualify for the$2, 000 a month, is nowopen, and they will start to accept those applications next Monday.
I've tweeted out thatlink, and we'll put it upon our website and on the screen throughout the day as well.
and I think that's it from the federal government fornow.
We'll have lots of coverage from provinces through the day and across the country as they becomeavailable.
I will say good-bye fornow, and I'll see youtomorrow.
My colleague, andrewnichols, will take over.
Now, let's bring you theupdate from Ontario anddoug ford is speaking toontarians now.
See you tomorrow.



**Premier**:

I'll pass this over to ministerelliot, and she'll give you more information onthat.



**Minister**:

Well, this is something that we'veonly become more recently aware of as a concern, butdr.
Williams has issued directive today, issuing his strong recommendation that the local medical officers of health use their powers, under section 22 of the health protection promotion act, to require that people who have been diagnosed withcovid-19 maintain that status and stay inself-isolation.
This is going to befollowed up on by thelocal medical officers ofhealth.
and there are significantfines for people to not dothat.
I think the most importantthing is that they will befollowed up with theirlocal medical officers ofhealth to make sure theyare continuing thatself-isolation.



The next question.



The next question comes from Haley cooper from news talk 1010.
Please go ahead.



Good afternoon, premier.
We've had rob and cynthianow asking about modeling and projections, and I was going to ask myself, and we still haven't been given any numbers.
So why does it appear the government is hesitating in giving those numbers? people know this is fluid situation, but they also want to know, youknow, worst-case scenario, what is the provincelooking at. So why is the governmentnot giving the numbersthat it has seen?



**Premier**:

Well, as the minister of healthmentioned, there are different models.
There are a few differentmodels.
If we pick one model overanother, it sends really two different messages.
Our message is very clear: we're going through some turbulent waters over the next few weeks.
and we need to do everything we can to make sure that peopleself-isolate.
We've been saying it overand over again everysingle day.
Those models candrastically, drasticallychange.
If we underestimate on oneside and we overestimateon the other and create apanic if we overestimate, but the facts are, and itis very clear: we're goingthrough very turbulentwaters.
Make sure that you don'tcongregate.
Last weekend it was alittle shocking to all ofus that we see parks andbeaches packed.
We acted immediately, making sure that webrought through an orderto make sure we closed theparks and closed thebeaches.
I don't know what more we can say outside of stay inyour home.
Self-isolate when you can.
Go out one person at atime to go bet yourgroceries.
and if you have seniors, your parents orgrandparents, make surethey stay inside.
Anyone over the age of 70, stay inside.
We can't emphasize itenough.

**Question**:

and so theworst-case scenario, thenumbers that you haveseen, are they worse thanwhat you were expecting? do you think thatontarians will hear thenumbers and think that itis worse than what theywere expecting?



**Premier**:

No. The worst-case scenariocan get bad.
We were saying -- andwe've been very clear --we can have two ways to gohere: we go the route ofitaly and spain and we seethe numbers over there.
Or we can take the otherroute, south korea andgermany.
We all want to go theroute south korea hasgone, making sure thatpeople self-isolate, theydon't spread the virus.
As I said earlier on, thevirus doesn't spreaditself.
It spreads being onpeople.
and the further we cankeep away, socialdistancing, practice that, the quicker we're going to get through this.



Okay.
This will be the lastquestion.



The last question comes from Marietta from globalnews.



Hi. We are dealing with people of loved ones at long carefacilities, and even though their family members are not testing positive for COVID-19, they're able to see thesemembers.
Some people have saidthey're worried about their family members.
There is one case where someone actually did become positive after their family was -- is this an order that theycan't leave the long-termcare homes to get care?



**Premier**:

Again, we put that order in, that people can't go and visit their loved ones.
I understand the question that they want to take them out.
I'm going to, again, pass this over to the minister of health.
and then I have a followup after this.



**Minister**:

Thank you.
I believe that what was happening before with family members who were coming to the homes, taking their family memberout, maybe taking them home for dinner or somewhere else and then bringing them back.
That's why we've changed the rules so that peoplearen't allowed to leave the home.
However, if family members want to take their love done and have them join them and stay with them, of course they'll have to be cleared for COVID-19before that happensbecause we don't want themto infect their families.
If they want to do that, they can do that, but thenthey can't come back inwhile COVID-19 is stillwith us. So I think what we werereally trying to stophappening was a situationwhere family members werebeing taken out just forthe day and returned.



Followup.



Mr. Premier?



**Premier**:

If you have followup question onhealth, I can bring the minister back up.



Premier, if you want Togo ahead and finish youranswer, go ahead.



**Premier**:

Oh, no. It is a separate item.
Please, if you have another question.

---

**Question**:

We've heard from workers that they'rebeing forbidden from wearing masks on shifts.
When we asked Dr. Yaffeand Dr. Williams on this, they said the policy for it being mandatory for all those in the long-termcare facilities to wearmask was under review.
If you're hearing fromfrontline health careworkers they do not feelsafe on the job --



**Premier**:

I've been saying from day one, intake the advice of our chief medical officer of health and our healthprofessionals.
I understand it isdifficult.
I don't overrule -- I want to stress this, I listen to the healthprofessionals, are you safer with the mask? absolutely your safer.
I can't stand up here and say you wouldn't be safer without a mask.
In My opinion, you would be safer with a mask.
But, again, I'm going to stick with the advice from the chief medical officer of health and the health professionals that give meadvice.



Okay.
Thank you.



**Premier**:

I just --you know, throughout thistime, I come up here and talk about the ontariospirit.
The Ontario spirit that companies around this great province are stepping up. I got a phone call the other day from the president of internationalbrands, a great company up in new market.
His name is mark.
I usually don't give lastnames, so I'll say mark, the c. E.o. Up there, called up and said, premier, we have adonation for the province.
and this is a bigdonation.
40, 000 bottles of handsanitizer.
He said, I have 10 skids, where do they go? this is what I'm talkingabout, companies steppingup.
I was on a phone calltoday with one of theradio station by brucecounty, and bruce power, the c. E.o. Got on, andthey said they're donating6, 000 P.P.E. S, handsanitizer -- that'sprobably one of thelargest donations we'vehad from bruce power.
and we thank you.
I have to say, keep itcoming.
Because with the powerthat these companies have, we're an economicpowerhouse around theworld, and they'restepping up and supportingthe cause.
Another shout-out that iwant to do that doesn'tget very much recognitionat all, but shows up everysingle day, the help withthe sign language ischristopher behind me. and, christopher, do youhave a minute just to comeup here for one minute.
I apologize, you can takeover the sign language.
But this gentleman showsup, never complains, neversays a word.
I told him today how manycomments and e-mails andphone calls I get aboutyou, My friend.
You're a champion.
You're a rock star, helping people in the deafcommunity.
and it's so important therole you're playing.
and I was told today thatmoving forward, you're nolonger going to be with usphysically here, butyou'll be with us as ateam.
is that right?



Yes.
May I?



**Premier**:

Go ahead, please.



Absolutely.
I will still be part of the team, and I may be behind the cameras and supporting the interpreters that arehere.
We're trying to make sure that all deaf ontarianshave access.
and we're moving to include deaf interpreters.
They make sure that including deaf children and deaf adults and everybody can understand the message clear to keep themselves safe fromcovid-19 and be able to follow the very important messaging that premier ford is sharing with us. We will be changing Little bit, but I will still be in the building.



**Premier**:

Thank you so much for your service.
People like this, likechristopher, realchampions, stepping up and never complaining.
One more shout-out, thepeople who work infinancial institutions, you're going in there, andwe haven't mentioned themyet, but they're dealingwith you day in and dayout, making sure that theeconomy is flowing, andthe money is flowing, andthey're sitting there atthe teller's booth, and iwant to thank them and allontarians.
