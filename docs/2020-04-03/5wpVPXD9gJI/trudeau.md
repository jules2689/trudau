**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I want to start this morning by wishing everyone a happy Sikh heritage month.
Every day Sikh Canadians make our cities and neighbourhoods stronger.
Right now, when people need helpmost, you're stepping up once again.
In Regina you're delivering supplies to neighbours, while inmississauga, you're donating to the food bank.
It shows we're stronger together, supporting each other.
You are doing your part and so many others are doing the same.
 

[voice of interpreter] to the people on the frontline, thank you.
To our farmers and truckers, to the people delivering air cargo, to nurses and doctors, you are working 24/7 so we can eat and take our medications.
You are protecting our health and the health of our families.
Your government is there for you and we all say thank you.


[end of translation] our government has introduced a three-point economic plan to protect jobs, help people laid off, and support businesses.
If you're worried about your job, we're helping your employerkeep you on the payroll with thecanada emergency wage subsidy.
Later today Minister morneau, Minister ng, and Minister Bains will provide an update about this 75% wage subsidy.
What I can say now is it's goingto be available for businesses big and small that are not publicly funded and have seen a 30% or more decline in gross revenues.
That includes everything from bars and restaurants to charities and non-profits.
Applications will soon open through the C.R.A. Like I said on Friday, this money is for workers.
Employers will need to attest that they're doing everything they can to pay the remaining 25% of people's wages.
These are unprecedented times and will require us to pull together as a country and trust each other as Canadians.
So there will be stiff and severe penalties for trying to take advantage of this system and of your fellow Canadians.
 

[voice of interpreter] -- wage subsidy is there for small and large companies that are not publicly funded and have seen a 30% decline in their revenues.
That includes restaurants and bars, charities, and non-profits.
You will soon be able to apply on the C.R.A. Website.
That money is for workers.
Employers who use that subsidy have to do everything in their power to pay the remaining 25% of workers' wages.
As I've said, we are in an unprecedented situation.
We have to pull together as a country and trust each other there will be very stiff and severe penalties for anyone who tries to take advantage of the system and fellow Canadians.


[end of translation] these are unprecedented times so we're taking unprecedented action.
While we put this measure in place, we're continuing to move forward on the other two prongs of our economic plan, to help business owners worried about rent or other bills, we've brought in new loans.
To help people who lose their paycheque, whether freelance or laid off, we created the Canada emergency response benefit.
On that front, I have some good news to share.
 

[voice of interpreter] starting on April 6, if you have not yet applied for employment insurance, you can apply online to receive the Canada emergency response benefit.
That is available to everyone.
But if you are receiving the wage subsidy, you cannot receivethe emergency response benefit.
You can apply by visiting Canada.
Ca when you apply, you can receive your benefit by mailor direct deposit.
After that, all you will have todo is confirm you are without a job once every month.
Again, if you have already applied for employment insurance, you do not need to register starting on April 6. We are also taking measures to prevent the system to be overloaded by applications.
Later today Minister Duclos and Minister qualtrough will have more details to share about the process and eligibility criteria.


[end of translation] you will be able to apply for the Canada emergency response benefit.
a reminder, if you're getting the wage subsidy from your employer, you can't collect the CERB.
It's one or the other.
You can't get both of these benefits.
For the CERB, you can register online at Canada.
Ca. You should receive your payments in three to five days.
If you can't apply online, don'tworry, you can call the Canada revenue agency for help over thephone.
By mail, you'll get your cheque in 10 days.
After applying all you have to do to keep getting this benefit is to check in every month to say that you're still out of work.
If you've already applied through e. I., you're all set up and don't need to do anything onapril 6. We're putting measures in place so we don't overload the system, but I can assure you everyone will get their money.
Later today Minister Duclos and Minister qualtrough will have more details on the process fromeligibility to getting your cheque.
The bottom line is this, we're getting you the help you need when you need it. We have a plan to protect jobs, to help those laid off, and to support businesses that are having cash flow problems.
We're not done yet.
We're going to keep working hardto make sure you're getting the support you need.
This is the largest economic program in Canada's history.
So I've asked the house leader and the deputy Minister to reachout to the other parties about bringing back parliament.
This must be a team Canada effort.
Governments of all orders acrossthe country are stepping up to fulfil their responsibilities tocanadians.
Canada hasn't seen this type of civic mobilization since the second world war.
These are the biggest economic measures in our lifetimes, to defeat a threat to our health.
These historic measures will support Canadians to stay home to defeat COVID-19. But the government alone cannot win this fight.
We all have to answer the call of duty.
This is service that most of us have never been called upon to do. We, each of us, have to live up to our end of the bargain.
We must fulfil our collective responsibility to each other.
Listening to public health rulesis your duty.
Staying home is your way to serve.
So be smart about what you do and the choices you make.
That is how you will serve your country and how we will all serve each other.
How well we do this right now determines where our country will be in two weeks or in two months.
It's in our hands.
It's in your hands.
 

[voice of interpreter] we all have a role to play.
We have a collective responsibility.
Where we are in a few weeks or afew months does not depend on mebut on you.
I am calling on your civic duty to protect other s others.
If you do not follow the public health guidelines, you are putting others at risk.
You have a moral obligation to remain home.
We all have a moral obligation to take care of each other.
It is by working together that we will come out of this.
It is by remaining true to our values that we will stay who we are as Canadians.
Thank you.



Thank you.
We'll now go to the phone line for one question and one follow-up. Operator.



Thank you.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
This morning do you consider that part of your responsibility is to be transparent about supplies of equipment? can you guarantee us there will be no shortage of P.P.E.? the ministers were unable to do that yesterday.



**Answer**:

In this situation we cannot guarantee anything.
We are working very, very hard to meet the various needs, to make sure the necessary protective equipment is delivered right across the country.
We are developing solutions right here in Canada to replace the equipment we use every single day in order to keep our healthcare professionals healthy.
We will continue to work with the provinces and the various jurisdictions to meet all of their needs.
But much of that depends on the choices that Canadians make now, how people behave today and in the coming weeks and the choices they make in terms of keeping this pandemic under control and being able to continue to protect the people that are working to protect us.

**Question**:

There is a pressing need for surgical masks in quÉbec.
You heard that.
Can you tell quÉbecers or quÉbecthat your way of resolving this is to transfer part of the federal supply to quÉbec?



**Answer**:

Yes, absolutely.
The federal stockpile is there to help Canadians where they need help.
I have spoken directly to premier legault.
He pointed out the challenges that they're facing in quÉbec at this time, and we will be there to work very hard to meet their needs.
We are expecting shipments of P.P.E. Very soon and we will be getting more as well.
We are going to be working on the resources to be available here in Canada and we will make sure there is no shortage in Canada.
Of course we understand it is a very difficult situation and we will all have to do our part.
[end of translation].



Thank you.
Next question, operator.



Thank you.
Next question MIA rabson, the Canadian press." your line is observe.

---

**Question**:

I wonder if you can explain why the national emergency stockpile did not keep equipment in the hands of healthcare workers who needed and whether we're going to the defence production act to fill the need.



**Answer**:

The defence production act we've seen in the United states is about forcing and ordering companies who might not otherwise do it to step up and produce the necessary equipment for a war time or crisis situation.
Here in Canada what we've seen is companies across the country putting up their hands and asking to do it, offering any help they can right across the country to switch their manufacturing over to necessary goods, necessary equipment.
We so far have seen such an overwhelming response from businesses that we have no need of bringing in at this point a similar act.
Of course we'll always keep an eye on what we need to do in future situations or how we can adjust.
The federal stockpile has been ensuring over the past weeks that there is enough equipment across the country to respond to the needs of the provinces and what they've asked for.
 [voice of interpreter] in the United States they did decide to bring in the defence production act, but in Canada I can tell you that we have no need at this time to do that, because Canadian manufacturers and businesses across the country and plants all across the country have all been volunteering to help us to switch their processes to manufacture what we need.
Now, of course if we find we have a need to do that later on, we will do so, but for now I can only thank all the different companies who have stepped-up and offered to help us and are working very hard to help their fellow citizens.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

I'm wondering if you could let us know what assurances you have from the Americans that they've dropped the idea of moving troops to the United States-Canada border.



**Answer**:

The ongoing conversations we have with the American administration continue on a broad range of subjects.
We have heard that's not something they're continuing to pursue, but we will of course continue to engage with the American administration as new situations come up and as thingsdevelop.
 [voice of interpreter] I can tell you that we continue to regularly speak to the United States administration on issues involving our border and critical trade between our two countries.
For the time being we have heard that they do not intend to pursue that idea, but we continue to have discussions with them.
[end of translation].



Thank you.
Operator, next question.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
There is a shortage of medical equipment in quÉbec or there will be soon.
How will the government help quÉbec to resolve this problem to reassure the quÉbec medical professionals?



**Answer**:

Well, we are currently working very hard with the other provinces to see what options are there to help quÉbecand other regions that are in need of equipment, but we're also working at the international level to try and ensure that we can bring in additional equipment.
For example, our ambassador in china is working diligently to follow up on this and get the material in that we have ordered.
But the fact is that there are many, many countries that are running after the same equipment.
We are working hard and doing everything we can to ensure that nowhere in Canada will there be a shortage of P.P.E., but there's still a lot of work to be done.

---

**Question**:

Can you tell me whether this will happen before the end of the week? and on another topic, Mr. Trudeau, there's a government document where it says that these -- the current measures will have to last untiljuly or August.



**Answer**:

I can tell you that we are expecting to receive deliveries in a very short time frame, in the next few days or perhaps even sooner.
When it comes to scenarios, as have said very often, we are looking at all sorts of different scenarios.
It could last longer, it could last less time.
As I've always said, that will really depend on the choices and the behaviour of Canadians every single day, how we keep ourselves safe, how we keep everyone else safe, the choices we are making, all of that has direct impact on how long this is going to last.
But looking around the world, even in countries like south Korea where they were able to manage the crisis fairly well, those measures remain in place for quite a long time.
I think people will have to expect that we will be facing this for many, many weeks to come if not months.
[end of translation].



Thank you.
Next question.



Eric Atkins, "the globe and mail".

**Question**:

Thank you.
Given that Canadians returning from abroad are bringing confirmed cases of COVID-19 intocanada, why are airlines and the government still bringing Canadians home?



**Answer**:

That is a good but a difficult question.
In question we understand how important it is to keep Canadians safe.
We hope and are demanding that those Canadians who do return home self-isolate for two weeks.
I know there are countries that have decided that people overseas or people elsewhere arenot allowed to come home to Canada.
That's not a choice we've made.
We want Canadians to come home.
But we also very much expect anddemand that they keep themselvesand their neighbours safe by self-isolating in rigorous conditions for two weeks as soonas they get home.
We would much rather be able to have people home than stranded elsewhere around the world, where things are getting worse.
 [voice of interpreter] as a country, we made the decision to ask Canadians or to offer Canadians the possibility of coming back home if they're abroad.
This is not the decision that other countries made.
There are some countries -- or the citizens of other countries that are unable to go home, but we decided to bring home all Canadians because it's importantfor Canadians to be able to get back home where they are safer.
At the same time, we have brought in very strict and rigorous measures so that peoplecoming back will not put others at risk, their neighbours, the healthcare workers, and so on. That's why it is so important that whoever is coming back to Canada from travel abroad self-isolate for 14 days to keepus all safe and to keep our healthcare workers safe.



One follow-up.

---

**Question**:

I wonder what the public health case is for allowing any Canadians to return.



**Answer**:

The public health case is that if people return and properly and rigorously self-isolate, then we are not significantly increasing the risk to everyone else.
It requires ensuring that they do, indeed, self-isolate, but incanada we try to look out for each other.
That's been the characteristic of what we've seen over these past weeks.
As people are there to help eachother and people are making choices to make sure they're notputting themselves, neighbours, family at risk.
We see neighbours dropping off food to those who can't go out.
We see volunteerism up, calling to volunteer at kids help phone.
Canadians help each other when we're in tough times, and part of helping each other in tough times is making sure that Canadians who are stuck overseascan some home, but part of the responsibility they have then isto make sure they're not puttingothers at risk and make sure that they self-isolate.

**Question**:

Kevin Gallagher with CTV.
Toronto's chief public health officer indicated that the measures to mitigate COVID-19 could be in place for 12 weeks.
There are according to the "national post" internal government documents that say these measures will be in place until July.
You yourself have not shared these type of projections.
Don't Canadians have a right to know how long these important, yet disruptive, public health measures will be in place for so that businesses can plan and families can plan?



**Answer**:

We have been open and transparent with Canadians on the facts.
I've said from the very beginning that there are a wide range of scenarios that we have been looking for that we are planning for, that we are trying to work towards as a government, as a country.
We know that we are going to be in place for a number of more weeks, perhaps months.
Everything depends on how Canadians behave, the choices you make to stay at home, to self-isolate, to not go to six different stores when you go grocery shopping.
Try to only go grocery shopping once a week, to be careful to keep 2 metres apart when you go for a walk if you're allowed to go for a walk.
These sorts of things are what will arrest the spread and increase of the virus.
We need all of us to do the bestwe can to make it through this unprecedented situation, and that's exactly what Canadians are doing.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that it has been important all -- every step of the way to be openwith Canadians.
That's why we've been saying it could last for weeks or even months.
At the same time, there are a range of different scenarios that we're looking at and for which we are preparing.
But the critical thing here is Canadians' behaviour.
If Canadians make the right choice, if they decide to stay home as much as possible, if they keep a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others, if they try not to go to eight different stores when they go out to buy food once a week, thechoices that we are making and our behaviour at this time will have a direct impact on where we're going to be in a few weeksand a few months.
That's why we are here to support families and individuals, businesses.
We are here to keep our economy stable while it is practically at a standstill, so that we can recover quickly when we are ableto.
BLT that when is something we will know only in time.
As I said, it depends on the choices we make now.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

Rather startling death projection released in the United states.
is there a similar projection incanada? and if so, why have we not heard about these sorts of details?



**Answer**:

As we've said, there are a range of projections depending on how Canadians are behaving, how isolation is working.
I can say right now that the fact that so many Canadians are behaving in the right ways, are choosing to stay home, are choosing to self-isolate, are choosing to stay in their bubble, as Dr. Tam says, are choosing to not endanger themselves or their loved ones or their neighbours or our healthcare workers is an extremely good sign.
We are of course watching very, very carefully as the numbers creep up, as they rise more rapidly in different areas.
We will take the measures necessary to do everything we can to keep Canadians safe.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] radio-Canada.
Mr. Trudeau, there are people who are home right now and they hear you say this may last weeksor months.
There is a great deal of uncertainty and people are worried.
is there -- is it possible to have more specific information so that people are able to plan their lives over the next few weeks? can we say to people that July is a realistic scenario? it may not happen, but is a realistic scenario?



**Answer**:

Well, I can say it ISS realistic scenario, but there are other shorter scenarios, there are other longer ones as well.
We do not know -- we know that we're trying to control the spread and flatten the curve, but it does not depend on a government.
It depends on all citizens.
We are preparing and looking at a whole range of possibilities.
It is possible that it will last few weeks.
It is possible it will last a few months.
We will do whatever we need to do. First of all, two things.
We will do everything we can to keep people healthy and also ensure that we have the ability to come out of this so that all Canadians have the resources they need to remain in isolation as long as they have to.

---

**Question**:

Mr. Scheer this morning proposed that the g. S.t. Collected from businesses over the last six months be refunded to them.
What do you think of that idea? is that on the table?



**Answer**:

Well, there are all kinds of ideas coming forward from various sources and we're open to any proposal and we'll look at everything.
Now, in terms of aid for businesses and particularly for workers, what we put on the table thus far are measures that represent the largest and the most unprecedented program in our history.
This will help workers, this will help businesses.
There will probably be more that has to be done and we will be there listening and looking at what we can do. We're always open to any suggestion and I want to thank everyone who's making proposals.
If that can help Canadians to come through this crisis so that we can recover and get back on our feet at the end.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

You've been talking about the efforts your government is making to procure medical equipment, protective gear, and front line workers are still talking about shortages.
Why is there this disconnect between the assurances you're offering and what front line workers are experiencing?



**Answer**:

We recognize the challenges that front line workers are facing in different parts of the country.
We are working very closely with the provincial authorities in charge of those healthcare systems to meet the needs they are faced with.
We are facing -- looking at a global demand for these supplies that is unprecedented.
Countries around the world are trying to get more of these supplies.
We are expecting to see some shipments coming in very shortly that will help in Canada.
We're continuing to work on more shipments in the coming weeks.
We are also working on tooling up our own production so we can have made-in-Canada solutions inthe coming weeks and months if that's how long this lasts.
We are doing everything we can to meet the very real and pressing needs that we have in our healthcare system right across the country, particularlyin some areas.
All I can say is we will continue to work extremely hard to try and solve this problem because we need our healthcare systems and our healthcare workers specifically to have theprotection they need as they keep the rest of us safe.

---

**Question**:

The premier of quÉbec was talking yesterday about supplies running out in three to seven days.
We've seen shortages in Ontario as well.
Have you spoken to those two provinces and offered them aid at this time?



**Answer**:

We are offering all the help we possibly can to all provinces, particularly quÉbec and Ontario that are facing difficult situations in terms ofsupplies.
I can tell you that we are going to be receiving a shipment very soon of necessary equipment.
There are more to come in the coming days and weeks as well.
We will continue to do everything we can to make sure our healthcare workers get the support they need to keep us safe.
We also, as I spoke about yesterday, have manufacturers stepping up so we can have made-in-Canada solutions and we're not reliant on other countries as the world is looking for more P.P.E.

**Question**:

The scientific literature is fairly clear on how mask use by the public can help cut the spread of influenza during a pandemic and some countries are making mask use mandatory across the board, yet in Canada we are told that mask use won't help unless you're asymptomatic.
I wonder if the government is willing to take masks away from healthcare workers when there ISS shortage.



**Answer**:

Every recommendation we make comes from science officials and is based on recommendations from that community.
This is an ongoing conversation amongst health professionals around the world.
We are going to defer to Dr. Tam.

---

**Question**:

If there are dissenting opinions in the international scientific and medical community on wearing masks for the public if they areasymptomatic, do we not then owe it to the public to put whatever protective measures in place to protect them?



**Answer**:

I'm going to continue to defer to Dr. Tam on this issue.
I know there's much discussion going on on that, and we certainly want to take the right decisions to make sure that Canadians are protected and our healthcare workers are protected.
Merci.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily update.
Of course we stand by and wait for federal cabinet ministers and public health officials and the finance Minister of Canada at 2:00. Let me bring in Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane before we hand things off to that press conference.
Some critical details for Canadians there in terms of the emergency benefit measure, but Will say this.
There was a lot of pressing of the Prime Minister to try to get sense of a timeline which I think mentally would help a lot of people if they knew how long this was going to go on. Also because we do hear from other politicians and public health officials around timeline.
B.c. Saying zero chance of the restrictions on gatherings beinglifted before may.
The Prime Minister did not want to put any sort of timeline on it, saying it will be weeks and months, but that it really depends on Canadians' behaviour to know how long this will go on.



**Vassy**:

I wanted to touch on that because I think it's a significant part of what we just heard from the Prime Minister.
I would start with the caveat that he's right and that is what lot of public health officials are saying insofar as our behaviours right now will dictate the ultimate length of that timeline.
However, there are other politicians and other public health officials, as you point out, Rosie, at different levels of government that are attaching various timelines to various scenarios.
Even south of the border last night I played on My show a big portion of the press conference from the president of the United States as well as Dr. Birx, who heads up the coordination of their medical response.
They went into granular detail presenting data to Americans about what they can expect under various scenarios, not just physical distancing, but here is if we have full mitigation efforts intact in this part of the country here is how many deaths you may see overall, here is what the mortality rate looks like and here is without mitigation.
I think the questions are correct.
I think the government deserves some questions on this.
The Prime Minister was very unwilling to present -- he admitted there are a variety of scenarios.
I understand that and I think Canadians understand that, but he did not want to put forth any data or predictions based on those various scenarios.
I think as Canadians start to hear that from different levels of government or south of the border, they will continue to wonder and want the answer from the federal government.
Give us a sense, especially as you pointed out for businesses that are sinking and might not last one or two months, how can they plan for the probability this might go on longer.
I take the point that it is dependant on our actions and that is a point we have to continue to drive home.
I think there is a genuine interest on what data the federal government has in front of it and when we might be able to access that data as Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

I should also say that those are all good points.
The Prime Minister has previously talked about making some modelling data available.
I know that is very much reliant on provinces complying with thatrequest, but it is something he said they can do. The other big headline, David, is that parliament will be recalled at some point.



**David**:

Parliament will be recalled to pass the wage subsidy legislation.
The timeline that is more alarming out of that news conference is what the premier of quÉbec is saying, three to seven days before their supplies are running out.
We know there are national stockpiles.
We don't know if those are depleted.
When we asked when the shipments are coming, it was in the comingdays, in the coming days.
If you're a healthcare workers, you need to know that.
The specifics on the delivery ofmasks, gloves, ventilators and everything else, that needs to become clear because we are getting very clear alarm bells from quÉbec and the front line hospitals here in Ontario.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you both very much for your coverage on our special on CBC television on thecovid-19 pandemic.
More coming up on CBC news network and CBC.
Ca. [♪♪♪]



**Rosemary**:

Welcome back.
I'm rosemary Barton here in Ottawa.
Welcome to our ongoing CBC news special streaming live on your CBC app or on CBC News.
Ca. Our big story coming out of Ottawa just moments ago, the Prime Minister announced he will call parliament back to pass measures to help the Canadian economy through the pandemic.
He called it the largest and most unprecedented economic program in Canadian history.
That's why they want parliament to come back because they realize the scope and importance of getting all-party support andall parties inside parliament tovote on this.
Earlier before justin trudeau spoke, conservative leader Andrew Scheer came out.
He criticized the government's response to the crisis.
We'll look more at that and alsolook at some of the measures toronto has put in place and theongoing conversation around timeline.
How long are we in this for.
Certainly in toronto some stark warnings from the public health officer of that city today, saying again that things are noton the right trajectory and thatpeople need to stay home, whether they have COVID-19, whether they've been in contact with someone with COVID-19. Even if they haven't, that theirmovements should be restricted really to the grocery store and maybe a walk outside.
Again, public health officers across the country calling on Canadians to double down on their efforts to self-isolate and really stay away from one another during this critical period.
All right.
As we wait for the federal cabinet ministers' update, let'sget some reaction from jagmeet singh who joins us from toronto.
Good to see you.



**Interview**:

Good to see you as well.



**Rosemary**:

You heard that the Prime Minister wants to call back parliament to have a conversation with the other parties about these measures.
How do you feel about that?



**Interview**:

We're ready to get back to parliament at any moment.
We know that Canadians need help immediately and we know the situation is very urgent.
The measures that the Prime Minister has announced were welcome measures around the 75% wage subsidy.
Something that we've been calling for and we think it would help small businesses and help people stay employed.
Today is the 1st of the month and I'm worried about how so many people across the country won't afford their rent or mortgage payment.
We need to work with all levels of government to deliver immediate rent help and put a pause on rent.



**Rosemary**:

How would the federal government be involved in that.
Every province across the country has now put in place eviction pauses so people won't be thrown out on the streets.
There are some provinces that have gone further, British Columbia, where your riding is, where there is that rental subsidy that will be given to renters.
Banks have been told to defer mortgages.
I'm not clear what the federal government could do on something that is a provincial jurisdiction.



**Interview**:

The deferral system is not helping people out the way it should.
Under the constitution, banks are federally regulated.
Mortgage payments and rent are deeply connected.
If we can negotiate and use the power that we have to make sure there is a pause in mortgages, it will significantly help in moving towards rent free or pausing rent.
There is a role the federal government can play.
There are significant powers under the constitution and the banks act.
Using those powers, we can get to a point where we put a pause on mortgage and rent as well.
There is a role to be played by the federal government.



**Rosemary**:

Some banks have been deferring mortgages.
We've heard other places where not everyone qualifies for that.
What would be the stick the federal government could use to compel the banks to --



**Interview**:

Section 91 of the constitution gives us powers of regulation of the banks to the federal government.
The banks act, which is also federal legislation, gives significant powers to the federal government.
Basically what we need to do is enforce a clear message using the powers we have that there needs to be a pause on mortgage.
Using that pause on mortgage works with provinces to have a pause on rent.
People cannot afford to pay their bills when there is no money coming in. There are so many job losses.
People are struggling.
We need to get to a point where there is a pause.
If there is a pause on mortgage and rent, we can get there.
The deputy Prime Minister said herself, this is not a time to fight.
This is a time to help people.
I believe we need to help people.
Here is a concrete way to do it. Pause mortgages and work with banks.
That's what we need to do.



**Rosemary**:

The wage subsidy of75% now applies to every company in this country that has lost 30% more of revenue.
How quickly do you think that needs to be available? I guess parliament will come back because it has become a much larger package than was initially anticipated.



**Interview**:

Weeks ago we acknowledged that the government was responding that things had changed since their initially request or proposal of the wage subsidy.
I called for 75%. this is something that businesses need right away.
Another thing that businesses need, particularly in the service industry and the hospitality industry, they need relief when it comes to their commercial rent and mortgages.
We need to do a lot more.
I'm prepared to work with the government.
There's some great measures that the Prime Minister has announced.
There is a bit of a lack of urgency.
To your question, we need to move quickly and people need to have access to the wage subsidy, the emergency benefit.
We need quicker access.
I still believe the best way to give people help is the universal basic income, sending money to all Canadians.
Those who don't need it, we can tax that back in the next tax cycle.
People need help urgently and that is not getting to them that respects the desperation they'regoing through.



**Rosemary**:

That's federal n. D.p. Leader jagmeet singh sin toronto.
"power & politics" host Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane are here.
We will break down what the Prime Minister said.
I sake -- take Mr. Singh's pointthat everyone would have rather this happened yesterday, but there was some desire to have parliament weigh in on this package.
There was the conservatives in particular who thought that parliament did need to be recalled and as a measure of caution and a measure of collaboration, I would imagine the government is going ahead and doing that.
But that also means that there will be at least 48 hours now before they can organize to get some percentage of people here that will have to unfold in a timely way.
It took a little bit longer thanexpected last time.
All these things take time.
The more time they take means the more people and businesses are waiting.
That's a function of government and certainly the government is operating at break-neck speed, but it is, I'm sure, frustratingfor people who are waiting for help who needed it two days ago.
Vassy.



**Vassy**:

We'll have to see what the timeline is for recalling parliament and if that impacts these programs.
The first program, the big one, the CERB.
That's the money if you've been laid off or can't work because of COVID-19 you can access.
The Prime Minister gave details that it had been anticipated that you could apply on April 6. He confirmed that that will be the day you can start applying and you have the option to ask for your payments via direct deposit or by mail.
If you're doing direct deposit, it could be between three and five days.
It will take up to 10 days to get the money by mail.
There are six days until that application process starts.
I'm waiting to hear when parliament will come back.
It sounds like it is to be determined.
It could be as early as next week, but that will depend on the negotiations between the party house leaders which are taking place as we speak.
If they come back for one day, they enable the legislation to go ahead and the April 6 date goes ahead.
The timeline might not be too negatively impacted.
Those are the details on the CERB from the Prime Minister.
On the wage subsidy, still no clarity on how the government will measure the 30% drop in revenue that it's saying you will need to show at some point before or after this all goes down in order to qualify for that money.
He says the application process will be through the C.R.A. Like the CERB benefit.
So that's a new detail as well.
He also emphasized that businesses and employers should be doing everything in their power to pay the remaining 25%. I don't know how significant that ends up being.
What does that mean for people applying, how are they going to prove that.
Again, those details we are expecting a little bit later today from the finance Minister.
Certainly those questions will be put to the finance Minister.
As of now, those are the new details that the Prime Minister revealed on those programs I know so many Canadians are interested in right now.



**Rosemary**:

You're right, that is an important piece of information.
April 6 had been the target date and it sounds like that is the date you can start going on to that portal and figuring out how you can get the $2, 000 a month if you need it, and so many people do. David, we're tracking this story on a number of fronts.
Again, I take Mr. Singh's point, but I'm not sure how much the federal government can do other than to make sure people have some income coming in to pay.
This is very much a provincial jurisdiction.
Certainly there can be conversations around that.
It sounds like there have been.
But beyond that, I guess it would be some sort of conversation with the banks who haven't been terribly compliant, for instance, on credit card interest rates.
Beyond that, I'm not really sure that the federal government has an extensive role to play in rent and mortgage.



**David**:

They keep talking about the team Canada approach and that is what it would take.
My understanding is they can use the federal banking act for certain things, but they have no capacity to force that flow through, through the landlord to the renter.
That's why you would need some provincial requirement to deal with this thing.
People could be humane and if the banks gave them a break, they could pass that on to theirclients.
a couple of other things that we got some clarity on today was that on the wage top-up if you're a business, the Prime Minister telling us it would be a simple attestation that you were doing everything you can topay the wage top-up. That's like the benefits that ordinary Canadians can apply forto get the $2, 000 a month, you can swear and confirm online that you don't have a job and income.
All of these programs are being built with the philosophy of paymoney first, ask questions later.
They'll deal with any spillage or fraud after the fact, again with a stern warning that there would be severe consequences if anyone takes advantage of this.
Also the point was made that specifically the Prime Minister singled out that bars and restaurants would be eligible for this help.
There was a fuss -- on Twitter the business development bank ofcanada, its website said it doesn't provide money to bars orto people that only serve alcohol.
On the same page, they said theydon't do credit lines and zero interest loans and they're aboutto be offering those things.
Those restrictions have gone outthe window.
Assurances to people who sell alcohol as their primary source of business that they will be eligible for this, despite some terribly outdated government websites saying they wouldn't qualify.



**Rosemary**:

Probably more important to get the money out the door than to update the website.
If things are moving so quickly on a daily basis, the websites aren't always accurate and that's why there are so many people e-mailing.



**David**:

Government agencies are doing things they wouldn't have considered doing a month ago.
The Prime Minister called this the largest civic mobilization since the second world war.
That's why passport offices are doing e. I. applications.
The BDC is going to be giving loans to bars and restaurants.



**Rosemary**:

While we wait for this press conference to happen, there will be another critical one if you are interested in the wage subsidy, and so many people will be. Those details to come at 2:00 p. M. eastern.
That press conference will be intoronto with the finance Minister, the Minister of small business, and the Minister of innovation.
In the meantime, quÉbec who we've been talking, who has a large number of cases at this stage, is trying to clamp down as best it can on those outbreaks in various places, including trying to avoid all non-essential travel from one region to another.
We've seen particular focus, forinstance, in montreal and the eastern townships trying to limit people moving from anywhere else in the province tothose zones.
They are putting their provincial police officers in different locations to make sureno one is doing that.
As we wait for these ministers -- I think they're filing in right now.
Let me go quickly to hillary johnstone who is on the portage bridge.
Tell me about these restrictionsif you can do it.



**Reporter**:

That sounds good.
As of right now, we don't see any restrictions on this bridge, one of the five links between Ottawa and gatineau.
Cars are still slowing.
What we know is there are four more regions in the province that are supposed to have these check-points.
The out outaouais in western quÉbec.
The police on the Ontario side say they don't plan to enforce this.
This is happening on the quÉbec side.
We also don't know what sorts ofpenalties there will be for those found violating these measures.
That is still yet to cock.
The police on the Ontario side are still asking people to avoidall non-essential travel betweenthe two provinces.
We also know that there are a couple of groups of people who are going to be exempt from this, healthcare workers, humanitarian support, and anyonedeemed necessary to keep the supply chain moving.
Those are the sorts of people who will be exempt from this ban, but this is in an effort toslow the spread of COVID-19 and is a travel ban into western quÉbec.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, you are on the bridge not far from me. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the day.
Let's go back to Ottawa.
Here is the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland.



These tough actions are absolutely necessary and I would like to offer My strongest support to the leaders who have taken these actions and to commend them.
 [voice of interpreter] this is a critical week in our fight against this virus.
Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
Stay strong and stay home unless you do essential work such as stocking the shelves of our grocery stores or working in the healthcare system.
You can go for a walk or a run, but stay at a distance from others and wash your hands.
I know this is difficult, but Canadians are resilient and I know we can do this.
All over Canada, leaders, like leaders in Toronto and in quÉbec, are taking additional action to enforce physical distancing and to protect their citizens.
These tough actions are absolutely necessary.
This is true leadership, and I support these leaders.
[end of translation] today we are going to hear from Canada's chief public health officer and her deputy, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
We are going to hear from our Minister of health, patty hajdu.
By video link we are going to hear from our Minister of employment, workforce development, and disability inclusion, Carla qualtrough.
 [voice of interpreter] and we'll hear from the president of the treasury board, Mr. Duclos.



Right now there are 9, 017 cases, including 105 deaths.
So in addition, at any point in time, as I've always said there are many people under investigation, some are waiting for their lab results and some have not been tested.
Even if you haven't heard about cases in the community, that doesn't mean there are no cases and no exposures potentially there.
Act as though there is illness around you and act accordingly.
So we've now completed tests for over 250, 000 people in Canada with around 3.7% of people confirmed as positive and 95% confirmed as negative.
I would like to point to our website that has a lot of EPA deem logic data.
I will clarify there is something known as an epidemic curve posted on our website.
Every day you're hearing the cumulative numbers being reported.
9, 017 is the total number of cases we've had ever since the start of the outbreak in Canada.
What you don't see with these numbers is when did these people get sick, what does the trajectory look like.
That's what an epidemic curve is and that's on our website.
If you go there -- and as I've said before what you're getting reported today is what happened to someone when they got infected and symptomatic at least two weeks ago.
The numbers you're seeing reported is what happened to someone two weeks ago.
So you would see that the curve itself goes up and down.
The two-week delay is when people get sick, they have to present, get tested, get the test results.
It takes time for public health to investigate an outbreak, findthe contact, test the contact.
It's quite an involved process to get you that epidemic curve.
So look at it. You can see what actually is happening, which is also why when some of the public health measures were put in a couple ofweeks ago, we're not going to see the impact of the epidemic curve of those measures for a little while, but this week is acrucial time, particularly in the west when the epidemic started earlier, to see what's happened to that outbreak.
I'll leave it at that, but obviously some of these technical pieces Dr. Njoo and I could unpack for you at any timeyou wish to ask us questions.
So essentially with -- just to add, though, the epidemic curve, we will not know where the peak of an outbreak is until you've actually passed that peak.
That is another concept you needto remember.
This will keep going until you get to the other side.
You don't know that you've hit that peak.
It takes a little bit of lag time.
So right now with the number of cases and outbreaks that we are seeing, they are still connectedto a number of high-risk people in Canada, particularly long-term care facilities.
So there is still an urgent needto make sure and double down on precautions.
For other high-risk individuals living in community settings, itis likewise important to take every caution, which might mean staying home and getting supportfrom others.
So while many cases occur and adults and younger adults, it isreally people over the age of 60who account for 60% of hospitalizations and 93% of the deaths.
So again, the high-risk populations need to take every precaution.
With so many Canadians practising strict physical distancing, I'm heartened to hear the many stories about how people are staying connected virtually across all ages.
Physical distancing can put a strain on our mental health withfeelings of isolation and lonliness.
It is important to remember we are all joined as Canadians in avital sclecketive effort to preserve health and save lives across the country.
Please reach out and connect andsupport others who may be havinga particularly difficult time.
We all need to keep up physical distancing while maintaining strong social connections.
What happens to that epidemic curve is up to everybody single one of us. Thank you.



Okay.
Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Dr. Njoo.



[voice of interpreter] hello, everyone.
There are currently 9, 017 cases of COVID-19, including 105 deaths.
In addition, at any point in time there are many people underinvestigation, waiting laboratory results, or who have not been tested.
So even if you are not hearing of cases in your community, that does not mean there are no cases or there are no exposures waiting to happen.
We have now completed tests for over 250, 000 people in Canada, with about 3.7% confirmed as positive and about 95% confirmed as negative.
Dr. Tam gave us a lot of detail and I'll try to summarize in french.
There's a lot of data on our website and we welcome you to have a look at our website.
One important concept is that of the epidemic curve.
We give you cumulative data every day, but that doesn't truly paint a picture of today'ssituation.
On our site there are graphs that show how many cases are reported every day by onset of symptoms.
That type of data allows us to see the peak and see trends.
We don't know whether we've yet hit the peak of the epidemic curve.
It is so essential that everyone continue to practice social distancing -- physical distancing, rather.
Then we'll see what the impact will be in the upcoming weeks.
There will always be a bit of a lag because the data we get each day reflects the exposures that occurred two or even three weeksago.
When people contract the virus, they then take some time to fall ill and then consult the medicalassistant.
Then they get tested, the laboratory gets the results, then we trace the contact and test the contacts.
All that takes time and is reflected in the epidemic curve.
With higher numbers in long-termcare facilities, there is an urgent need to double down on precautions.
For other high-risk individuals who are living in community settings, it is likewise important to take every precaution, which means staying home and getting help and support from others.
So many Canadians are practisingstrict physical distancing and it warms My heart to hear the many stories of people staying connected virtually.
No matter how old we are, physical distancing can really put a strain on our mental health.
It can make us feel isolated andlonely.
It's important to remember that while we are keeping physically apart, we are all joined as Canadians in this crucial, collective effort to preserve health and save lives across thecountry.
Please, stay in touch with others and keep finding ways to connect and to support others who may be having a difficult time.
We all need to keep up physical distancing while maintaining strong social connections.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Njoo.
[end of translation] now we will hear from Minister patty hajdu.



[voice of interpreter] I would like to start by thanking all those who are doing their part.
I know this is difficult, but we can't stop now.
You are the first line of defence against this virus.
Our government is trying to improve the situation.
[end of translation] new mobile app to help Canadians stay informed.
The Canada COVID-19 app is available for free at the Canada.
Cawebsite.
This app provides up-to-date information about the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, including advice for preventing the spreadof the virus, important contact information, and guidance for seeking medical help.
It includes a way for Canadians to check their symptoms using the app.
This app is one more way that we can give Canadians information they are seeking during the outbreak.
We are going to continue to reach out to Canadians in any way possible so we can work together to flatten the curve.
I will also mention a digital toolkit that can help with the stress that many of us are feeling in this uncertain time.
I also want to reiterate the message Dr. Tam has been sharingwith Canadians.
The number of cases reported daily does not paint a full picture of what is happening across the country.
It is important to remember thatmany people in all parts of the country are waiting on lab results or they haven't been tested.
So if you are not hearing about cases in your community, it doesn't mean that they don't exist.
For that reason, people must stay the course and practice social and physical distancing and follow the local and national public health advice, no matter where you are or no matter how many cases there are or aren't in your community.
I know this is very hard, but I'm confident that if we continue to work for the common good, we can and will weather this storm.
The important thing to remember is also to remain kind to one another.
This time is difficult for everyone.
This is the time to reach out safely.
Call your loved ones.
Write a letter to a friend.
Volunteer safely to help those needing support.
Our government will continue to work hard to have your back, butyou, each and every one of you, can make a difference today in how someone is feeling.
We must meet our fear with courage.
It will take courage to act withcompassion.
But it is by meeting fear with courage and compassion that we will get through this together and come out stronger on the other side.



Thank you very much, patty.
Now we are going to hear from the Minister of employment, workforce development, and disability inclusion, Carla qualtrough.
She is joining us by videolink.
C.R.A. please.



Hello, Bonjour.
I'm pleased to be able to join you and My cabinet colleagues today via video conference to give an update on the Canada emergency response benefit that was announced last week.
 [voice of interpreter] the past two weeks there has been an unprecedented wave of e. I. requests.
1.3 million e. I. requests have been filed.
To put things in perspective, in2018, 2019, 2.1 million Canadians received e. I. the whole year.
[end of translation] people from retirement and redesigned our system.
As I said last week, the reality is that our e. I. system wasn't designed to address the global public health crisis and its significant economic impacts.
It doesn't cover all types of workers, particularly those with irregular hours and lower pay, often filled by Canada's most vulnerable population, including persons with disabilities, youth, and new Canadians.
Since the beginning, we've been equivocal in our commitment to supporting all workers facing hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
That's why we announced the Canada emergency response benefit.
As we've developed our plans, our priority has been to ensure that Canadians can access this benefit in the simplest and fastest way possible.
Today we're pleased to let Canadians know that more information on how to apply for the CERB is available online at Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
The CERB is being jointly administered by service Canada and the Canada revenue agency which will leverage the government of Canada's two largest payment systems allowingfor a more timely delivery of this benefit.
Direct deposit payments will be made in three to five days of applying, with cheques taking approximately 10 days.
 [voice of interpreter] the web page will be updated often and will be an important place to get up-to-date information.
and for Canadians who don't haveaccess to internet or a computer, they will be able to apply through service Canada by phone.
All those who will be eligible should open an account on service Canada or with the C.R.A. Before Monday.
[end of translation] direct deposit in order to receive the benefits faster.
For Canadians who have already applied for e. I., there is no need to reapply.
These applications will be automatically enrolled in the CERB.
As I mentioned earlier, we received over 1 million applications with more coming ineach day.
We have processed more than 430, 000 of those claims.
In the space of a few weeks, service Canada has developed andimplemented a streamlined process that, starting today, will be able automatically to process approximatelily 400, 000 applications per day.
This means that the backlog of COVID-19-related applications will be addressed in the next week.
This also means that some Canadians who have already applied through e. I. will begin receiving their CERB payment over the course of the next few days.
 [voice of interpreter] the public service is working hard to support Canadians and give them the helpthey need in these difficult times.
I would like to thank the publicservice and public servants for their hard work.
[end of translation] to support canadian workers and their families.
Merci.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, C.R.A. and I am relieved the technology actually worked.
 [voice of interpreter] now let's hear from the president of the treasury board, jean-yves Duclos.



Thank you and thank you for tuning this.
The COVID-19 pandemic is an economic and social crisis and health crisis.
This is an unprecedented crisis, so our government had taken major action to protect the health and safety of each Canadian.
In addition to the measures thatyou're already aware of that we've taken, we want to ensure that all workers impacted by this crisis can quickly receive the financial support that they need to get through these difficult times.
So we have implemented the new Canada emergency response benefit.
Our goal is to make this money available quickly so that Canadians can access it quickly and in a very simple, easy way.
We want it to be simple and clear.
We don't want to leave anyone behind.
[end of translation] we want to get money into the hands of Canadians right away if they are not working because they are sick, have been laid off, have lost their income, or are looking after their children.
 [voice of interpreter] thanks to the Canada emergency response benefit salary workers and freelancers who are eligible will receive $2, 000 every four weeks for up to four months.
The Canada emergency response benefit has been set up very quickly.
This is a really unprecedented effort.
Two government groups, the Canada revenue agency and social development Canada are working together to deliver the Canada emergency response benefit together.
[end of translation] Canadians will be directed towards a service option that best fits their circumstances.
Canada.
Ca/coronavirus-CERB.
It is the same page for everyone.
Demands will be accepted starting on April 6. The website is Canada.
Ca/coronavirus-CERB.
It is ready as of today.
So you can begin to apply for the CERB.
You will be able to apply as of April 6, but the website is ready already.
We anticipate a huge amount of accounts, so we ask Canadians toapply based on their birth dates.
If you are born in January, February, and March, reply on April 6. If you were born in April, may, or June, reply on April 7. Reply on April 8 if you were born in July, August, or September.
and on April 9 if you were born in October, November, or december.
and this process will have no effect on when you receive your benefit or how much you receive.
The Canada revenue agency is working tirelessly on this benefit and the Canada revenue agency will deliver this benefitusing solid systems and countying on their dedicated staff, which is already the casefor the 6 million Canadians who are currently receiving the Canada child benefit.
Our government will support Canadians and businesses.
We pledge to. We need to get the right information out.
So in conclusion, we would like to thank journalists and thank the media for their great work in spreading important messages and information to Canadians.
Each and every one of us has hadto make sacrifices, but we will get through this crisis together.
Let's continue to take care of one another.
Thank you.



Thank you.
We are now ready to take questions.
[end of translation].



We'll take three questions on the phone and come back to the room.
Operator.
