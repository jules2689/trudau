The first question is from Alex Boeing from the Toronto star." ".

**Question**:

Thank you for taking My question.
This might be for Minister hajduand Dr. Tam.
This morning the Prime Minister was talking about a range of scenarios going forward with the number of infections, I assume number of fatalities, length of time we could be existing under the social isolation and physical distancing measures.
I'm wondering if you can give a sense of that range.
What is the best-case scenario in actual numbers of infections and fatalities and length of time and what is the worst-case scenario in those three things.



I'll start, Alex.
Thanks for the question and theni'll turn over to Dr. Contaminate for some specifics.
That's the work we're doing right now, the modelling work, in terms of what we can anticipate given various measures taken across the country by various provinces and local municipalities, as well as federal government actions.
It's not as easy of an answer As think it would seem, in that different ranges can be anticipated in different ways, depending on the measures that have been taken, the effectiveness of those measures, when they have been taken, ET cetera.
So all that to say that that is top of mind for us in terms of what we're doing at health because, not only does it give us a way to more accurately predict what kind of surge we might see in different parts of the country, essentially important in terms of how we use our physical and human resources, but also what kinds of patterns of disease we might be anticipating given the different measures.
and I guess the third important part, how might alleviating some of these measures impact our ability to control that curve or reduce the severity of future surges or future waves.
So as much as I wish I could give you a simple answer, there isn't one, but a lot of work is being done on that.
I don't know if Dr. Tam has more that you want to add.



**Answer**:

I think that's a goodexplanation.
Really, together with the other chief medical officers, we've been looking at planning different scenarios.
All of us recognize that right now how you influence the trajectory of this pandemic absolutely is dependant on exactly what we're doing right now.
So it's to act rapidly even when we don't have all the information, we must act as we are doing now.
In some respects, as we strengthen our public health measures over the last weeks, it also took a little bit of time for Canadians truly to pick up this message about physical distancing.
So a lot of these measures were taken just ahead of this.
So we really want to make a massive effort -- because the length of time you could be into this epidemic wave is all dependant on what we're doing right now.
Scenario planning is simple on apiece of paper because you just have to look at the rates, mild, moderate, severe, and give you anumber.
It's not that helpful for us right now.
We have been doing that exercise, but we really want to focus our attention of getting this first wave under control.
Just to add that any planning scenario has us potentially overwhelming our healthcare system.
As I've said part of the exercise so you free up some of the hospital resources in I. C.u. S, purchasing extra ventilators.
But the real message to Canadians is that on a whole range of scenarios, this healthcare system isn't well designed to cope with it if we don't do something about it now.
It doesn't matter which number you plug in, but that is the truth of the matter.
It is a serious situation.
You've seen how this plays out in certain areas of the United States.
None of those scenarios are a good one.
You've got to do something aboutit now.



Thank you, doctor.
Alex, a follow-up?

---

**Question**:

I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
You're saying in the range of scenarios none of them are good, in that we're looking at a surge that could test the capacity of our healthcare systems no matterwhat?



**Answer**:

Absolutely.
That is the bottom line.
Everyone is trying really hard as I say to move the resources so you can cope with a -- it might be an upcoming surge of patients, people have looked at alternate sites, absolutely trying to expand the current system, the health workforce in order to cope with this.
So I do believe the health capacity -- compared to what your regular day might be before this pandemic has been freed up quite a bit.
Still, even if you look at some of the lower attack rates, it is not something we want to see.
Public health has to try to suppress the curve, while the healthcare system is trying to increase its capacity.
I ink if we can suppress this initial curve -- the healthcare system right now is coping.
When we look at the fatality rate at the moment, we know that is an unstable number because some people are still in a very critical condition.
The percentage of fatality is hovering around that 1% in some areas where you hit a particular geographic location where there are a lot of people in long-termcare facilities get a higher fatality rate.
But the healthcare system is actually coping quite well at the moment.
Any of those bigger projections when we look at the worst-case scenarios, the healthcare systemwill not be able to cope is about now doing really fast, but it is fundamentally in the end -- some very difficult decisions may have to be made about the prioritization of existing resources.
That's some of the really critical work that's being done in the health system right now.



Alex, I will end by saying healthcare systems were never designed for this kind of surge.
That is the challenge.
I think if Canadians can take anything away from what Dr. Tam has said, she's said this over and over, is that our individual actions is the strongest tool we have to protect our healthcare system.
This is a sneaky virus.
We often -- we may feel very mildly ill.
Some people don't feel ill at all.
That is why the social distancing and the physical distancing is so critically important because an assumption that you're well and, therefore, are not posing a risk to somebody at the grocery store or posing a risk to your neighbours while you're having a drink on the patio as things warm up is the wrong assumption to make.
We have to act as if we all have this virus.
It doesn't mean you can't go fora walk, but you need to keep the6' between you and those around.
This is a hard message for many, many Canadians.
I know that and I know there are circumstances out there that are very difficult.
Ultimately at the end of the day our neighbours' life depends on us taking this seriously because ultimately at the end of the day our healthcare system cannot cope with the surge.
It was never designed to see that many critical patients all at once or was any system as we see from countries all around the world trying to prepare for this surge.
Canadians play an important role in trying to keep their neighbour or loved one alive.



Thank you, Minister.



Thank you.
The next question is from Ellen bouzeti.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] I have a question for Minister Duclos.
Could you give us some more information about the difference between the 75% wage subsidy and the Canada emergency response benefit of $500 per week.
If you have a salary of $35, 000, $675 a week, then the wage subsidy is more advantageous.
The government seems to be saying in both cases the relationship between employer and employee is maintained and in both cases Canadians won't have to go to work to receive the benefits.
So why would Canadians request the emergency response benefit when they could prefer the wage subsidy?



**Answer**:

Thank you for your question.
We absolutely want Canadians' needs met.
The relationships are important in the short term, especially if there is a gradual return of employees to work in Canada.
It is important because we want to get the economy rolling strongly again.
So we want to maintain these employment relationships.
We have two goals.
Our first goal is met by the Canadian emergency response benefit and the wage subsidies that we have announced and that we are giving you more information about today.
Whether businesses can pay theiremployees' salaries or not in the upcoming weeks, there will be $2, 000 a month available for all workers.
Next, in many cases we expect that businesses will continue to pay their employees' salaries.
Above and beyond the $2, 000 of Canada emergency response benefit.
and that's where the government's 75% wage subsidy comes into play.
Minister morneau, Minister ng, and other ministers have given us more information about how the wage subsidy would take effect.

**Question**:

My question is for Minister hajdu.
It's regarding the stockpile.
We hear that quÉbec is almost facing a shortage of masks.
I just would like to know how many in the stockpiles can be sent right away to quÉbec and how much -- what percentage of the overall stockpile does that represent and when will that be sent?



**Answer**:

Thank you.
I don't have the numbers for you in terms of percentages and total numbers in the stockpile, but I will tell you that there is a deputy Minister table working right now on an allocation that is based on actual need.
We know that all hospitals are in need of personal protective equipment and the provinces and territories are working with the federal government to develop an allocation process that really gets at making sure those products are going to the areas in the country that are experiencing the surges right now so we can do this in an equitable and fair way that makes sure that Canadians and the healthcare workers that are serving Canadians have their needs met in a way that's going to make sense.
This is difficult work, as you can imagine.
Every province and territory is looking to build up their own stockpile for what will come in the days and weeks to come.
I have confidence with the officials who are working for a fair solution.



[voice of interpreter] I'd like to add something.
Minister an and made an announcement yesterday.
She announced that the federal government has begun to purchase60, 000 masks.
Today we ordered 5, 000 more masks.
As Minister hajdu said, ministerhajdu is working closely with her counterparts in all of the provinces.
We understand the situation in quÉbec is particularly difficult.
Last night I spoke to Minister Sonia la belle and we spoke about the situation.
[end of translation].



The next question is from miarabson from "the Canadian press." please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

My question is also about the stockpile.
I know we've been asking this question a lot and I just don't think we have an actual answer.
How big is the stockpile? and if we have a stockpile, why are we hearing from doctors and nurses on the front lines that they did not have enough.
Did we not have enough in the stockpile? have we not started distributing anything from it?



**Answer**:

Again, number of the exact numbers because the numbers change, as you can imagine, day-to-day as we dispense equipment across the country.
To your question as to whether we have enough, no, we likely did not have enough.
I would say obviously governments all across the worldare in the same situation as us. It is an extremely competitive space for personal protective equipment.
We are pulling out all the stops, as you have heard from the Prime Minister, from the Minister of procurement, the deputy Prime Minister.
We are working I would say 24 hours around-the-clock trying toprocure equipment in a global situation where equipment is extremely tight.
I have heard those stories myself.
I know provinces and territoriesare developing different rules for the use and distribution of personal protective equipment.
We will not stop this work to get the P.P.E. That we need.
and I would say that this is an opportunity for all governments to consider reinvesting in public health preparedness.
I look forward to those conversations on the other side of this.
I will tell you that the situation right now is such thatour government has tho money, will, and workforce and everyone's focus is firmly on getting P.P.E. We will continue to fight for Canada's shares in that available stock as it comes online.
Secondly, I'll say that the workon domestic production is incredibly important.
I feel very, I would say -- I feel very warmed by the effort of canadian companies that have reached out to me personally, I know reached out to many other members of parliament, many other ministers about their efforts to retool.
The reason why it took so long to find that word is there is a feeling of warmth when I think of canadian companies putting everything into turning their manufacturing processes around as quickly as possible to createthe things that canadian frontline workers need.
We're going to continue to support them.
The work so that we can accelerate regulatory processes to get these products created, to make sure they meet the specifications that healthcare workers need and frontline workers need.
This is work that is happening literally around-the-clock.
I'm incredibly proud of My colleagues who are working so hard on this.
Thank you for the question.



Thank you, Minister.
We'll turn to the room now starting with Julie from CBC.

**Question**:

I'm just wondering, it could be for ms. Freeland or ms. Qualtrough.
Could you explain to Canadians in a really simple way -- the house of commons was here last week to pass a benefits package.
Why do you have to come back? is there a problem? what has to be fixed? is it going to delay people getting the money they urgently need?



**Answer**:

Why don't I begin there because the Prime Minister, as he said today, has asked me and the house leader and jean-yves to work with the opposition about a return of thehouse.
This is really because we understand and value and respectthe role of the opposition in our parliamentary democracy.
It is so important for parliament to play its role, to have its voice.
We have seen that as we have been doing our work to get the support to Canadians that they need.
Our work on procurement, our work on supporting Canadians as the economy is feeling the impacts of the coronavirus.
The Prime Minister has judged --and I 100% agree with him -- that the magnitude of the measures that we know are necessary means that it would bea good idea to bring parliament back to work on them.
I would also like to say we are very much hoping and trusting --and I really believe that the opposition in the house will work with us in the spirit in which we are working on these issues, which is understanding that now is not a time for partisanship.
Now is a time for a true team Canada effort as we collectivelyrise to a challenge which can only be compared to the nationalchallenge we faced future secondworld war.

---

**Question**:

You didn't say why you're coming back, what needs to be fixed, will it delay the payments?



**Answer**:

I think I did.
I said the Prime Minister believes -- and I agree with him -- that it is right and proper for us to be consulting with parliament and working withparliament, given the magnitude of our measures.
You have heard from Carla and from jean-yves our plan to urgently get the money out to Canadians because Canadians needthem desperately.

**Question**:

This question is for Dr. Tam.
It's a double whammy.
Do you have enough methods to track? also, with this surge coming apparently, how are doctors going to decide who gets a ventilator? are there guidelines and what are they? [ indiscernible ] -- do you haveenough and what about the ventilators, do you have enough?



**Answer**:

Contract tracing, gotit.
One of the most important things to get this first wave under control is not just case infection, but contact tracing.
That is a massive topic among the chief medical officers.
I have been having these discussions intensely to make sure that there's enough capacity, public health capacity, to do the contact tracing.
The majority of jurisdictions actually have -- but a few have said if the cases go up in the next couple of weeks, we're going to need help.
What we've done is at the federal level we'll be providing that kind of support as needed, by recruiting students and other human resources in order to provide that support to the provinces.
Many of them have done a lot of this preparation already.
They've recruited medical students, recruited other retired health professionals.
Alberta has a good training module already done to get people trained on contact tracing.
Many people have come up to say that they can help with that.
That is such an important question.
If anybody needs any help, we'rehere to provide that surge capacity.
That's one.
[ please stand by ]



Thank you, doctor.



**Doctor**:

Some of those factors and underlyingconditions, and there is aw hole host of conditions.



a clarification SA is afollowup.
Be mind full.
Mike, global?



Thank you.

**Question**:

Scientific literature says masks can reduce the pandemic.
Are we suggesting to the public in Canada we don'tgive them these masks, we keep them away from them.
is this because we prioritizing the healthcare system and the shortages there, or what other reason would it be that we wouldn't want the public to go out and have these masks?



So I'll start and theni'll turn to Dr. Tam.
I think first of all the premise that the science is clear is not accurate, but I think there are obviously growing thoughts around the use of masks for general publicwearing.
Certainly Dr. Tam has been keeping her eye on that science and giving us advice in terms of our ownmessaging.
But, yes, it is absolutely critical that if people are wearing masks outside, and it certainly is their prerogative to do that, by the way, that we're not taking away masks that are surgical or specialized that are extremely necessary on the frontline, and we're not using masks in a way, also, that are not appropriate.
So, for example, most people don't realize, most general public doesn'trealize that n95masks justput on don't necessarilyprovide a greater level ofpro toaks.
-- protection.
They have to be . which I'll described atthe end of the day.
Dr. Tam has also beenreally clear when we putthese masks on and off, we can unwittingly infectourselves or we could havea false sense of securitythat we have a mask, andtherefore be touching orface more and all kinds ofthings.
All that to say, it is apersonal choice.
and if people feel theywant to make a cloth maskand wear a cloth mask, itis perfectly in theirpurview.
But we do need to protectmedical masks for medicalprofessionals and otherfrontline workers who needthem in the course oftheir everyday duties.
That's the Minister ofhealth's perspective.
I'll see if Dr. Tam has anadditional comment.



**Doctor**:

Yes.
I think the number one sort of concern of the health system is to get the supply of medicalmasks, and respirators must be reserved for health care workers, those looking after patients.
That is probably the number one reason for making sure that the public understands that.
and we also know what actually does workalready, which is physicaldistancing.
Those droplets for ascertain distance.
That actually works.
Frequent handwashingabsolutely works.
Not touching your face are absolutely provenmeasures.
and everyone should practice those regardless of what else you're adding to those layers ofprotection.
and so -- and then the use of what I call non-medicalmasks or other materials.
I think I got asked thisquestion maybe a couple ofdays ago, by asymptomaticpeople just going about inthe community.
On the one hand, it mayreduce you from touchingyour nose and mouth.
If you covered up thoseparts, but you have to becareful you're not puttingyour finger in your eye, or when you're pullingyour mask on and off thatyou're touching your facein other ways.
That is one aspect of it. If you have a fabric orhomemade mask, it is a wayof covering your cough.
We have always said youshould cover your cough sothat you're not throwingyour droplets around tosomeone else or on asurface, for example.
So it is a way ofprotecting others, in away.
So, you know, when wego -- if you didn't have atissue, you cough intoyour elbow.
a mask acts as that kindof a barrier, if you wantto think of it that way.
The affectiveness of theuse of non-medical maskshasn't beenwell-demonstrated.
I think there may not beany harm in wearing it, asthe Minister says, if oneuses it properly, and itis not gaping, and it iswell-fitted, and youpractice good hygienicmeasures before, and youhave to wash your hands.
But I would say, absolutely, no matter whatyou do with that kind of acovering of your nose andmouth, you have topractice what we knowworks, which is thatphysical distancing, handwashing, and nottouching your face.
So I think I've alwayssaid from a public healthperspective, we need totake in evolution andinformation and science, and we've been doing that, and these are the kind ofthings that we discussedas a community of practicein terms of the publichealth.



**I THINK YOU MENTIONEDTHIS THE OTHER DAY, BUTJUST TO CLARIFY**:

When would someone in thepublic, because of theshortages, would you recommend that they have am ask or something?



**Doctor**:

So certainly if you are a group of persons who actually have the illness, you havecovid-19, and you've been asked to self-isolatebecause you may have beenexposed, and you need to get yourself some place to the actual clinic or whereyou're directed to go foressential appointments orother places, thencovering up your cough, covering your mouth.
and sometimes you'resymptoms may be mild andyou don't know if you'redeveloping it or not, andunder those circumstancescovering your mouth doesprevent your droplets frombeing transmitted toothers.
Still, it is people whoare symptomatic who mayhave the mild, andsometimes people may havea very mild illness or maynot recognize they'rebeginning to develop theillness.
So people in theincubation period.



Thank you.

**Question**:

Ian Webb, CTV news.
Rent was due for manycanadians, and manycanadians probablycouldn't make their rent, and while the government is going to provide $2, 000a month, that cheque is not coming for days, still.
and even when it doescome, in many cities, $2, 000 a month isn'tenough for rent.
and while it might be aprovincial/municipaljurisdiction, why hasn'tthe government stepped inat this point, where ithas helped homeowners, but it has not helped renters?



**Chrystia Freeland**:

So that is a really goodquestion, and it is something that we are very preoccupied by and focusedon, both inside our own government and in our conversations with theprovinces, many of which have taken real action on this front.
and I do want to be clear that in this crisis, we are never going to quibble about what is a provincial possibility and what is aresponsibility.
We believe and understand that the federal government has responsibility to allcanadians, and that the federal government has to provide leadership to thecountry.
This is a big challenge.
and the way we have structured our work is with the health and safety of Canadians.
To begin literally with the life and death issues.
and that is 100% the right thing to do. and that is overwhelmingly the centre of our work.
Next has come an effort todo everything we can to help Canadians weather this economic storm and to ensure our society, our economy are able to come roaring back when the crisis is over.
and we started in exactly the right place, which is doing what we could as quickly as we could to support individualcanadians, and that is what we have been hearing about from Carla and jeanives today.
The $2, 000 a month for people who can't work because of coronavirus or who have lost their jobs because of coronavirus.
The prime minister announced just last fridayanother huge step, which is the wage subsidyprogramme.
This is the biggest economic programme the government of Canada ha sever put into place.
I want Canadians to really understand the magnitude of it. and that programme is focused on keeping companies afloat and maintaining that essential connection between employers and workers.
It is so important so that we can go back to work when this is over.
and so important psychological for people.
and that was a huge, hugething.
Exactly the right thing todo next.
The third thing, which we have done already, is provide huge liquidity support to banks and to the banking system.
Also extremely important, and I really want -- and that has been the work of our government and of the bank of Canada, and that is in place.
Have we done everything that needs to be done? absolutely not.
Are there outstandingissues? 100%. are we focused on them? absolutely.
When it comes to the specific question of rent cheques being due, in addition to some concrete measures that we have seen taken by provinces andcities, which I commend, let me just also say to all of the landlords across the country, you have a responsibility to, in some places eviction snot being permitted during this crisis, but whether or not that applies to youspecifically, we are all in this together.
and it would be heartless act, indeed, to evict someone right now.
Given what we are all going through.
Now, it is the case that for some landlords, they need to make mortgagepayments, and they rely on rent to make thosepayments.
and, again there, we have been working with the banks and have taken some concrete steps to give people some breathingroom.

**Question**:

Um...quebectoday announced thatthey're going to put incheck points atinterprovincial borders, including the ones thatare not a five minutes' walk here into gatineau.
Time and time againstwe've been told withregard to measures, whether they be closingthe United States borders areclosing restaurants, orwhatever we're doing, when we asked about them, it's, we're not quite there yet.
Like gretzky says, you go to where the puck is goingto be, and not where itis.
is this the time withquebec closing -- notclosing but putting incheck points, is this thetime now for the federalgovernment to startlimiting domestic travel?



**Chrystia Freeland**:

You anticipated the metaphor I was going touse.
I grew up in northernalberta, so I am 100% Wayne Gretzky fan.
and that notion of skating to where the puck is going to be has actually been guiding principle for ourgovernment.
Quebec has taken some strong measures today.
The province of Quebec ha sour support and admiration for showing real leadership there, as does the city of Toronto, which introduced some very significant measurestoday.
Those are exactly the right things for Canada'sbiggest city.
and, again, I would like to really commend the leadership that john toryand Dr. Eileen DE villa have shown.
We have heard some very sobering messages from Dr. Tam this morning.
This is very serious.
It will get worse before it gets better.
and we can all do something about it. and what we can do is to maintain physicaldistancing.
Governments can help people to do that by introducing these toughmeasures.
But at the end of the day, every single one of us can make a difference.
and I hope and believe and trust that that is whatcanadians are doing.
As to whether further measures are beingcontemplated, of course they are.
Everything is on thetable.



I'll get back to that.
Different jurisdictions are going to take different measures base don their own epidemiology and their own realities.
Obviously, that is well within their jurisdiction to do that.
But I will also say where we know, at the federal level we need to redouble our efforts to actually bring down the number of cases across Canada, contact tracing being one of them, which is whywe're mobilizing hundred sand hundreds of people across the country to support provinces with that very onerous task.
Some people have put up their hand to ask forhelp, and we would urge other provinces to reachout, because we will be increasing having numbers of providing bodies and people who can help them with that work.
Secondly, isolating people who are symptomatic.
We want to make sure they have the capacity to isolate people who areill, even mildly so. In some cases, people do have family homes in which they can isolate, and in other cases people cannot.
So the work that is happening at theprovinces' andterritories' level is to find accommodations to isolate people who may not be able to do that in Private residence.
That will go a long way in reducing cases.
While provinces and territories and the government take a variety of measures to prevent close contact of people and increased mobility that we know in some cases puts additional strain onsystems, I think the practical steps of doubling down on some of the recommendations of the world health organization are increasinglyimportant.
That's where I, as the minister of health, have my focus on. is the practical things that can help province sand territories right now understand who is ill, whothey've had contact with, and how we ensure the isolation of those particular people who have come into close contact with the virus.



Thank you, Minister.
We'll take three last questions on the phone and call it a day.
Operator?



Thank you.
MercÍ. the next question is fromphillip, radio Canada.




Go ahead.




Caller:[speaking throughinterpreter]hi, Dr. Tam and Minister.
Some things have been saidabout possible shortagesof medical equipment, andalso about health systemswhich are not at all readyfor a substantial surgeand rise in cases.[speaking thrhinterpreter]



**Doctor**:

Thank you for the question.
Dr. Njoo here.
This is an ongoing issue.
There could be a shortage of personal protectiveequipment.
Minister hajdu has already said that all levels of government are working together closely.
and Dr. Tam and I are working very closely wit hour counterparts.
We are working to get our hands on equipment allover the world.
There is huge demand in the global market rightnow.
We are also increasing domestic production of essential equipment.
Made in Canada solutions.
Our goal right now is to flatten the curve.
Modeling shows us that if we do nothing, it will Beau catastrophe.
30, 50, 60% of the population could contract the coronavirus.
and so many people would need I. C.u. Care.
and we want to avoid thoseworst-case scenarios.
That's why measures, likephysical distancing, arecrucial.
All Canadians need tocontinue to do their part.
That's necessary toflatten the curve.
Hospitals and I. C.u. S, hypothetically speaking, perhaps a thousand peoplemight need an artificialventilator.
But if all 1, 000 have thisneed immediately, withinone week, that's differentthan having a need for athousand artificialventilators over a fewweeks, over a few months.
That's the goal, to reallyflatten the curve, toflatten and stretch outneeds.
and health authorities, inall provinces andterritories, are workingwith us. We're all working onpreparation, onpreparedness.
We are working ontemporary field hospitals, and we are calling backretired healthprofessionals to help outin the health care system.
and those who have otherhealth conditions, we arelooking at ways to carefor them outside ofhospital settings.
We are working so hard onso many levels in order toavoid the worst-casescenario.

---

**Question**:

Followupquestion.
Yes, but with all of the modeling and forecasts, how long will this last?



The Prime Minister said this morning it could last through July, but it could also last much longer.
In your predictions and your modeling, with the public health agency ofcanada, do you think it will last until July?



**Answer**:

It is too soon to tell.
All Canadians are currently taking thisseriously.
Countless Canadians are practicing physicaldistancing.
and here is what we'renoticing with the epidemiccurve: the cases thatwe're seeing appearing no ware cases where exposure occurred two or three weeks ago.
We'll have to follow what happens in the next two or three weeks to see whether what we are doing now is having an affect.
That's what we're going to be following closely.
We cannot predict what will happen in two or three weeks.
That's just not possible.
I think it is best if we take things one week at atime.
Let's focus on the fact that what we do this week will lead to results in a week or two.
That's what we should focus on.



**I'D LIKE TO ADDSOMETHING. THE PRIORITY IS WHAT WE DONOW WILL ACTUALLYDETERMINE HOW MUCH WE'RESTUCK IN THIS PLACE. MAYBE YOU CAN TRANSLATETHIS SO I DON'T SOUND LIKEA 7-YEAR-OLD.

If we don't do anything, it result would becatastrophic.
But Canadians andquebecers are listening to instructions with regards to physical distancing and basic hygiene, handwashing.
The governments are working very hard as well, not only with regard to public health, also healthcare on the ground andfrontline workers, but, also, what we saw yesterday with regard to the ability to produce medical equipment and provide it because we'regoing to need that in the coming weeks.



Thank you, Mr. Declaude.
Two questions on thephone.
Operator, thank you.



The next question is from health post Canada.
Your line is now open.
[speaking throhinterpreter]thank you very much.
You talk about all of themoney basically beingavailable.
But it seems like thereare obvious gaps in thesystem that haven't beenannounced so far.
Self-employed people --not all, but some haveseen a significant drop intheir income fromcovid-19. As we heard from premierlegault last week, peoplewho make minimum wage maynot even make $2, 000 atthe end of each month.
I know yesterday the Prime Minister talked aboutworking with theprovinces, but can yougive us an idea whatexactly is envisioned? these people are nowessential workers, andeverybody recognizes it --what is the federalgovernment thinking ofdoing if the people arestill showing up for workand they're not beingfinancially disadvantaged, compared to people whostay at home.



**Chrystia Freeland**:

Do you mind if we give car lathe first shot.
She has joined us byvideo.



Of course.



**Caller**:

Thank you.



Can you hear me?



Yes.



With respect to anyone who has reduced hours or reduced income, they'renot the target workers for the c. C. r. B. we're looking at workers who have lost their incomecompletely.
Those are the workers we want to cover by the c. C.r. B. there are details tofollow very shortlythrough other ministers offinance and smallbusinesses, and they'retrying to address that thelarger cohort of workerswho can't afford to keepthem on, or employers havereduced hours for, withrespect specifically topeople who areself-employed, that is apopulation of workerswe're working to figureout where they fit in, iftheir hours are simplyreduced.
If they have no income, they absolutely areeligible for the c. C.r. B. if your hours or reduced, we're trying to figure outhow that works.
out for right now, it isfor workers who have nosource of income.



If I may, in addition to what Carla just said, message from the canadianagency, which I said infrench, it is very important for Canadians to prepare for the canadaemergency responsebenefit.
It is to better prepare for the large expectedin-flow of the amount weexpect for the new canadaemergency responsebenefit.
We are launching today thewebsite, which is commonfor everyonecanada.
Ca/coronavirus.
and we're askingcanadians to put in theirdemand starting onapril 6th, according totheir birth month.
That is for those born injanuary, February, andmarch, the application onapril 6th.
On application April 7thfor those born in April, may, and June.
April 8th for those bornin July, August, andseptember.
and April 9th for thoseborn in October, November, and december.



Thank you, Minister.
a followup?



**Caller**:

Yeah.
Nobody actually responded to the minimum wageworkers.
What exactly is the federal government working towards when the Prime Minister says it is working with the provinces in terms of ensuring that those individuals who are working full-time are atleast making -- at leasttake home $2, 000.
If I could just add as afollowup: has any thoughtbeen given to thefamilies, unfortunate asit may be, medical workerswho end up dying becauseof COVID-19, deathbenefits as we give tocanadian forces members?



The minimum wage --



Again, we recognize, and we didn't in any's way disenfranchise or in away reduce the value and the contribution of people who work in essential serviceindustries, but also who get minimum wage.
We're working to figure out a way to recognize the important contributionsthey're making.
Whether it leads toimes, and as the minister said, that is conversation happening collaboratively with the provinces to make sure there aren't these gaps.
As you can appreciate, we're doing public policy work that would takeyears, in a matter ofdays.
and as new groupsidentify, they identify that haven't yet fit into any of these benefits.
We're working on that, is what I'm saying.



Thank you, Minister.
Maybe one last question on the phone.



Thank you.
MercÍ. the next question is fromlina dibb.
Please go ahead.
[speaking throhinterpreter]question.
Yes.
Hello.
I would like to come backto the shortage of masks in Quebec.
Mr. Trudeau said rightnow, in a very short timemasks would be deliveredto Quebec from ottawa'sstockpile.
But a few minutes ago, Minister hajdu gave a morenuanced answer.
Will Quebec receive masksfrom ottawa in the nextfew days.



**Answer**:

I can confirmyes.



**Caller**:

Thank you.
Thank you for your clear and short answer.
My next question is this: you said from the beginning that it is absolutely essential for supply chains to be left open with the United States because of the medical equipment that is coming from the United States, and not just with regard tocovid-19. But I wonder, have you received recent guarantees from the trumpadministration, given what is going on there, the200, 000 cases there --have you received guarantees from the trump administration that the medical equipment will continue to be sent tocanada, be it for COVID-19or for any other medicalnecessities?



**Answer**:

We discussed the relationship between the United States andcanada daily.
We discussed trade issues between Canada and the United States every day.
and we discuss the health situation in Canada and in the United States on daily basis.



**Caller**:

So noguarantees.



That concludes the press conference.
