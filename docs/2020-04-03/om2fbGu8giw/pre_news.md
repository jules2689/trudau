After his wife tested positive to the virus.
We're expecting him to speak to the country in about 15 minutes' time.
Let's bring in My two colleagues that have been helping me with these specials through the week.
Vassy kapelos and cbc's David Cochrane also joining me now.
a couple of bigger things happening today.
Let's sat er with this medical supply chain issue, which we know is real and the government is looking for ways to find people and industry and companies that can help them ramp up production of much needed supplies.



**Vassy**:

That is My expectation as to the content that we'll hear primarily from the Prime Minister today.
My understanding is that what he says will funnel through the departments of industry and what they're going to talk about is that almost every industrial programme they have will now be refocused on fighting COVID-19, so that supply chain that you mentioned, the level of preparedness t equipment necessary in order to protect ourselves and for health care workers, of course, most importantly to protect themselves.
All of that will be part of this announcement.
They'll try to gear existing programmes like the national research centre, superclusters, the innovation fund, procurement, all of it is going to have to be refocused on this issue.
They're also going to talk about perhaps the possibility of other firms retooling their existing manufacturing.
I'm not sure exactly which firms at this point.
I think it will be more of a general announcement today.
But that is essentially the big announcement coming from the Prime Minister today.
The second thing I'm told is that there will be something that we have already talked about and most Canadians expect, but a formal announcement from the Prime Minister that the border between the United States and Canada will officially enact those restrictions, limb, it only to essential travel, nonessential, a. K.a. If you are going for travel or leisure, that will come into effect as of midnight tonight.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
David, we'll pick up on that point with you and that is the border because that is the other significant shift that this country and the United States have made to try to contain the virus.
I would note that they are also moving to do the same thing with their southern border between the United States and Mexico.
But do we know more now about how practically this is going to work?



**Reporter**:

We're trying to figure out who is going to be allowed to cross the border.
The I what we need to think about it is who won't be allowed to cross the border.
This is the way this is going to be done.
Essentially a list of activities that are considered to be nonessential and if you are one of those, which is going to be the vast majority of people watching this and listening to this, you are not going to be allowed to cross the border.
It comes into effect, I believe Vassy said, at midnight tonight or certainly into tomorrow.
No tourism, no shopping, no random cross-bordering and there will be exemptions for health care workers and as the deputy Prime Minister said yesterday, essentially, keep on truckin'. if you are a trucker and delivering supplies of goods or trains and these things and people with critical visas, core, essential cross-border work will continue to be done.
Essentially in some ways, rosey, what's happening today is a shift from clamping down to ramping up. In that the industrial capacity of the country will be tilted towards things like gloves, masks, vent lays toer, face shields, beds if they need them.
I don't want to call it extreme measures but innovative measures are applied to places like Quebec where they're asking for hotel space.
People who don't have food or carpets in the room or close to hospitals where they can put people, not with COVID-19, but people displaced who need to have an eye kept on them but aren't in need of critical, urgent hospital care.
and while we're going to see this announcement today from the Prime Minister and the explanation of the steps that we're taking, we want to explain that there hasn't been a ramping up already going on. That has been happening.
In fact, Dr. Teresa tam, her entire job as head of the public health agency of Canada was created after sars the allow for a national collective response and to build things like stockpiles across the country.
So, they have surge capacity supplies already in place.
They have been backstopping those with the things they need specifically for several weeks through the normal means of procurement and buying things.
The step we're taking today, though, is a reorienting of industrial capacity to support that entire national effort to contain this virus.



**Rosemary**:

Right.
As people can well imagine, everyone in the world is in the market for the same products and let me also re-assure people, people may remember that when this outbreak first started in china, one of the things that we did when we were repatriating Canadians was we sent over a plane full of supplies to china.
This is about finding new ways to create our own supplies.
I think your characterization is accurate.
I think it is virtually unprecedented.
It is the kind of thing that starts to happen during wartime, right? that you have to start changing factories into doing different things.
We're standing by to bring you a press conference from the Prime Minister.
I'll just leave Vassy and david for a minutes, if I can, and bring in a doctor who might give us much needed perspective on the kinds of things that doctors need right now.
and we're going to go to Dr. Carlston if we can, head of medicine at the u. B.c. Department of medicine.
Doctor, thank you for joining us. Really appreciate it.



**Caller**:

Good morning.



**Rosemary**:

Can you tell me what your sense is of the equipment, the supplies we have that are needed to treat COVID-19 and there I'm thinking specifically about ventilators.
We have been reporting that Canada has around 6500 ventilators but obviously there is a need for more.



Right, rosey, you're right.
Hopefully it's what happens in the next few weeks, and not months.
We're Ok.at least in vancouver, but preparing for the worst and that means, a as you said before, that everyone as a team really has to carefully think of all the options and be very nimble on the ground.
For example, we're looking at older ventilators that were decommissioned that are in basements and looking for two vent lays toer potentially and an endless stream of contacts all around the world from innovators who want to bring in a new product and, of course, that comes with safety issues.
and we're not leaving anything off the take.



**Rosemary**:

How important is a ventilator for those defeating COVID-19. I'm sure people have read accounts of those who have died from it. It does seem like a ventilator is really your only commands s. That fair to say?



At the extreme of the condition, absolutely.
The condition that is associated with respiratory failure and the unfortunate ones that get to that point.
We also have to remember that we have our usual case load.
So our I. C.u. At vancouver general hospital, for example, is typically full, that's without COVID-19. As you said before, it is also the issue of who gets displaced and using alternative modes to take care of those patients.
They have to be creative and quick on the ground and we have to be mobilized for that.



**Rosemary**:

Any other concerns?



For sure, as you said, the ventilator doesn't operate on its own.
It needs to be adjusted and tweaked.
One of the things that the government is doing, can I much appreciate, is loosening the restrictions on the regulations for licensing.
and people are coming out of retirement.
Those who haven't been licensed yet, but soon would be. That is being accelerated.
So quite appropriately under this emergency situation, we're loosening the criteria a bit to get through this.



**Rosemary**:

I'll leave it there for now.
I hope you stick around so I can get a sense of your take on where -- on what the government announces shortly.
Thank you very much for weighing in. I'm going go back to David Cochrane for one moment, if I can.
He has a little bit more news onawa we're expecting to hear from the Prime Minister.
There are many Canadians stranded in various countries around the world and there's been efforts to help those Canadians get home, David.



**Reporter**:

I'm being told that we're going to get news of the first flight to help Canadians stranded abroad.
We know there was an urgent call to get people home as best they could.
This is a far more complex situation than obviously the Canadians stranded in Wuhan in the early days of this in January, which feels about five years ago now at this point because people are sprinkled around hundreds if not dozens of countries around the world.
and we know they were having conversations with the head people in Canada and west jet on what measures they can take to do air lifts essentially to get people back to safety in their homes.
I'm not sure this necessarily applies to people with citizenship.
This is largely for people on vacation for a matter of weeks and face the probability of it going on much longer.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. and we've heard of Canadians stranded in morocco and Peru, which is not letting anyone or out.
I will say that the United States state department is beginning to put together some charter flights to get Americans out of different countries where they have been stranded and I'll also mention that sun wing managed to repatriate some Canadians I believe just yesterday and offered some free seats on repatriation flights.
and they have been appealing to airlines to help them with this at a time when airlines are struggling.
Air Canada is expected to lay off more than 5, 000 flight attendants.
Probably in the coming days here.
Obviously under a lot of strain.
That trio.
-- that industry.
and we know that Minister garneau has talked about the need for financial aid for that industry moving forward.
As we wait for the Prime Minister to come out of his home, let me go to My new friend, cbc's Chris en sing in Windsor.
Because tonight we are expecting the border to close overnight.
At the same time, the United States is discussing similar measures with Mexico.
Give us a sense of what you are hearing from people who are going to be directly affected by this.



**Reporter**:

Everybody's day-to-day life depends on that border essentially.
We've heard from parents who have familis who live on this side of the border in windsor and their kids live in michigan, inside of detroit.
So, that connection there is really important and having that mental block, that physical block of that border not being able to criss-cross into nonessential services is weighing heavy on a lot of people.
That anxiety, that anxious feeling.
You've been talk about essential services being allowed to go back and forth.
Truckers toughing it out.
I looked up numbers here to get a sense.
It looks like there are 203, 000 trucks that went across the ambassador bridge in January alone.
Criss-crossing the border.
Of those, 340, 000 passenger vehicles.
We expect the traffic to dim and the traffic from the essential services going back and forth to keep that supply chain going will be huge during all of this.
Again a lot of those people who work in michigan that are from windsor in that health care industry, we've been told time and time again that the frontline workers there are depending on Canadians in windsor to be able to cross that border to help as they battle the coronavirus in michigan where the number of deaths are continuing to rise.
Which is something we've been watching closely here in our community.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Chris.
I'm going to leave it there.
We're expecting the Prime Minister in a minute's time.
Chris en sing in Windsor.
Let me take you again to the Prime Minister's home there at Rideau cottage in the nation's capital.
Just point out as one of our producers noted, the podium has changed a little bit.
There's actually now a board and sign in front of the podium that mentions Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Just to hit home to people that there is a government website where you can go and get a lot of practical information about the things the government is doing, ao*eter from a public health perspective or to help you in terms of the economy and if you are feeling like you might be laid off and have concerns around that.
I'll bring in Vassy for another minute.
We're told he will be on time.
There is a lot of different fronts to this story, whether it be to get manufacturers involved and repatriated canadiansful a lot of moving parts.



**Vassy**:

Most Canadians are interested in the ability to get them home.
Like you, I've been hearing from them nonstop.
In particular, many of them who can't find a way to get back so I think the Prime Minister signaled this would be coming and they would be very much interested in the details from.
The government's perspective, the industry announcement is a big one and it is significant because that will become -- fulfilling those needs will become something that is very important along the supply chain, the level of preparedness.
It's very important but will become even more important as the number of cases rise.
The border restrictions so relevant to many millions of Canadians as well as the capacity to go get them, the number of Canadians who arened extraed.
There -- who are stranded.
a lot of people are keenly interested in those details as well.



**Rosemary**:

To bring people up to speed on where this country zits -- country sits in terms of the number of cases, over 800, nearing 900 cases.
Remember, we do expect these numbers to grow fairly rapidly.
But that is because the testing is also growing and ramping up at a very fast speed.
25, 000 tests this week alone.
Here is the Prime Minister emerging from his home, Rideau cottage, where he'll speak to Canadians and bring us news about government measures today.
