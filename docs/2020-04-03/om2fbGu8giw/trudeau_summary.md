### Summary:







We are in discussion with Canadian airlines to help Canadians stranded abroad come home.
Further, today, Canada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement where we will now be returning irregular migrants who attempt to cross anywhere at the United States-Canada border. So, today we're announcing a new strategy that will make it easier for companies to help out during this critical time.
This initiative will help companies that are already making things like masks, ventilators and hand sanitize to massively scale up production.
So, our government will help these companies shift production from auto parts to medical supplies.
Our government is also creating new, innovative procurement streams to allow more businesses to develop solutions and products Canadians need because of COVID-19.

and our government is ready to work with you to maximize your impact.



We know that Canadian companies are among the most innovative and agile in the world and we'll work with them to respond to the pressing needs in our health care system.
These are historic times in which we need to do everything we can to support Canadians and mobilize all of our efforts in sport ways.
We know that Canada has never faced a situation like this and we'll face it together.



We are seeing Canadians across the country take on social distancing, take on measures that are protecting citizens. We'll continue to work to encourage people, to stay home, to practice social distancing, not just to protect themselves, but our health care workers and the system working hard to keep so many Canadians safe and healthy.

They are, for the most part, people who are legally in the United States and that is something that we are confident about.
