**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

Before I begin today's announcement, I want to say a few words about travel.
We are currently in discussion with Canadian airlines to help Canadians to come back home.
We'll have more to announce but the first flight will leave morocco over the weekend.
As I announced on Wednesday, Canada and the United States have concluded an agreement to prevent nonessential travel, particularly tourists.
Trade will, however, continue.
This measure will come into effect at midnight tonight.
Minister Blair will provide more information on this later today.
Further more, Canada and United States are announcing a mutual agreement under which we will now send back irregular migrants trying to cross the border.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are in discussion with Canadian airlines to help Canadians stranded abroad come home.
We will have more details to share, but the first flight will be picking up Canadians from morocco this weekend.
As I announced Wednesday, Canada and the United States have agreed to stop nonessential travel specifically with tourism and recreation.
Trade and commerce will continue.
This takes effect at midnight tonight and Minister Blair will give more details today.
Further, today, Canada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement where we will now be returning irregular migrants who attempt to cross anywhere at the United States-Canada border.




**Interpreter**:

Over the last week, the entire country has mobilized to slow down the spread of COVID-19. Doctors and nurses in retirement have come in to help in the hospitals.
and people administering the screening tests and researchers looking for a solution always are working longer hours.
The important thing is that people follow the instructions from our public health officials.
Frequent handwashing, working from home, limiting travel in order to protect our health and the health of others.
But it is not only individuals who want to hem their communities.
Businesses as well are stepping up. I think, for example, of grocery stores two are opening an hour earlier to serve the most vulnerable Canadians or manufacturing companies that are asking what they can do to help.
Just last week, a number of companies right across the country contacted our government to offer their assistance.
I want to thank them for their solidarity and their generosity.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

This week, many businesses put their hand up and asked us what they can do. So, today we're announcing a new strategy that will make it easier for companies to help out during this critical time.
We are launching Canada's plan to stop COVID-19 to announce the things we need.
This initiative will help companies that are already making things like masks, ventilators and hand sanitize to massively scale up production.
It will also provide support to those who want to retool their manufacturing facilities to contribute to this fight.
They reached out to us asking how they could help.
Our health care professionals really need support.
So, our government will help these companies shift production from auto parts to medical supplies.
We're also closing to reach agreements with several other companies including thorn hill medical, medic om and spartan bioscience.
There will be more on this later today.
Our government is also creating new, innovative procurement streams to allow more businesses to develop solutions and products Canadians need because of COVID-19. These products will be ready to use as soon as possible.
Canada is home to some of the best in know evade toes in the world and with this new initiative, we will harness their talent and know-how to get through these challenging times.




**Interpreter**:

We will rapidly produce the articles we need in Canada.
Through this plan, companies that are already producing respirators and masks and hand sanitize will be able to considerably scale up their production.
We will also be supporting those that need to buy equipment to allow their plants to produce the articles now in demand.
For example, the auto parts manufacturing association has reached out to us to see how it can help.
Our health care professionals really need our support and, therefore, our government will help those companies to produce medical equipment rather than auto parts.
We're also reaching agreements with a number of other companies, including thorn hill medical, medic om and spartan bioscience.
We'll have more to say about that later today.
Our government will also be introducing no innovative procurement streams in order to allow a larger number of businesses to develop solutions and products that Canadians need because of COVID-19. We will quickly be expediting this new process so that companies can get down to work as soon as possible.
Canadian innovators are among the best in the world and with this new strategy, we are putting in practice and using their talents and their knowledge in order to help us come through this difficult time together.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past week, service Canada and many government agencies have received a historic number of calls from concerned Canadians.
We received over 500, 000 applications so far this week compared to just under 27, 000 applications for the same week last year.
I know people are anxious to get the help they deserve and our government is working as fast as possible to support them.
This is, of course, an unprecedented situation and it's putting a lot of pressure on our system, but we're on it. Thousands of public servants are working around-the-clock to help you.
I know this past week has been hard on people for many reasons.
Working from home while the kids are running around.
Not being able to visit your parents at the nursing home, not hanging out with your friends.
It can take its toll.
But it is in these challenging times that we also see what we're made of. This past week, no matter how difficult, was further proof that Canadians are generous, kind and compassionate and that should give us all hope.
We all have a responsibility to do the right thing, whether it's working from home or practicing social distancing to protect our nurses, doctors and everyone who works in our health care system.
To deal with this crisis, we need everyone to come together and do their part.
That's what we've seen right across the country.
I want to thank all the workers who are stepping up and all the companies who are making things our country needs.
If you own a business and wondering what you can do, reach out.
We need your help.
Canadians need your help.
and our government is ready to work with you to maximize your impact.
I'll end this morning by addressing all those celebrating this past week.
This is usually a time when friends and families gather around the table and share a festive meal.
But this year is a bit different.
To the many families spending their first holiday without loved ones, you are in our thoughts.
I know many of you had to postpone festivities because of COVID-19 and I want to thank you for that as well.
Social distancing is crucial in limiting the spread of the virus and we do this now and soon we will be able to celebrate together.
In the meantime, I want to wish you a happy new year and look forward to marking the occasion with you again in the future.



**Interpreter**:

Once again, thank you.



**Reporter**:

How fast can a private company actually produce ventilators, for example, up to standard.
and can this keep up with the rate of what we're seeing.
Communications already in Ontario today.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that Canadian companies are among the most innovative and agile in the world and we'll work with them to respond to the pressing needs in our health care system.




**Interpreter**:

We are confident that the -- our companies that are among the most innovative and creative in the world will be able to respond to this request quickly and we'll have more to say about this at noon at a press conference.
To what extent the efforts that you're asking of these companies looks like the kinds of efforts we saw during world war ii. and with respect to roxham road, exactly how will this work? will there be a barrier.
Will people with sent back.
Well, this is a measure where people arriving at the border, if they're irregular migrants will be sent back and put back in the hands of United States authorities.
and this is a temporary measure that we're introducing and it will remain in place as long as this crisis exists.
It is an exceptional measure in order to protect our citizens.
We will continue to work together.
and we know that these are exceptional circumstances, unprecedented circumstances.
Some people are relating it to a war situation or other economic crises.
We will do whatever we need to do.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that the efforts we're going through are unprecedented.
These are historic times in which we need to do everything we can to support Canadians and mobilize all of our efforts in sport ways.
There are people talking about historical echoes, whether it is wartime or great depression.
We're focused on doing what we need to do right now.
We know that Canada has never faced a situation like this and we'll face it together.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
California is under an official state lock down to deal with COVID-19. Why isn't Canada putting stricter measures in place to ensure or enforce that people practice social distancing and do self-isolation and is Canada considering following california's lead?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are seeing Canadians across the country take on social distancing, take on measures that are protecting citizens.
We know there is always more to do. We'll continue to work to encourage people, to stay home, to practice social distancing, not just to protect themselves, but our health care workers and the system working hard to keep so many Canadians safe and healthy.
This is something we're going to continue to look for.
We'll always be open to taking new measures.
But we are continuing to impress upon Canadians how important it is to do just that.



**Reporter**:

is Canada considering a lockdown?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are looking at all possible different measures.
As I said repeatedly, nothing is off the table.
We will continue to announce [inaudible] if necessary.
Right now I want to congratulate and thank the millions upon millions of Canadians who are using social distancing and [inaudible] [audio cutting out][no audio]



**Rosemary**:

We're having a little technical difficulty here.
As soon as we get back a stable shot and we're able to hear the Prime Minister continue to take some questions from reporters, we'll bring that to you.
I'm sure everyone has felt systems being overwhelmed as of late as more people use phones and the internet and this could be related to that.
Anyway, we'll bring that back to you as soon as we can.
a couple of significant announcements from the Prime Minister there today.
First on that issue as to how industry might help going forward to create and secure our medical supply chain.
He says that basically they are going to do everything they can, that these are historic times and they need companies to mobilize.
Maybe I'll go to Vassy quickly while we wait to see if we can get back the Prime Minister just for your perspective on what we heard in from the Prime Minister.



**Vassy**:

You're right.
I want to start with the statistic that he gave that took My breath away that's actually one of the saddest things.
I mean, I know we expected it.



**Rosemary**:

Sorry.
We got him back.
I'll come right back.
I promise.
Here's the Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

People will make decisions in consequence based on their own choices.
I think that is the important thing that we're continuing to advise people about.



**Reporter**:





Thank you, Merci.
We'll take questions from the telephone lines.
Please go ahead.




**Reporter**:

Yes, thank you, Prime Minister.
Do you think Canadian athletes should go to the Tokyo Olympics, even if the games are not called off?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

IT that is an important question that many athletes and coaches and family members are asking themselves.
[audio cutting out]I have heard directly from Prime Minister abe that he is intents on continuing to hold these olympics and I congratulate him for that decision.
But obviously canadian athletes and the canadian olympic team will be making its decision as we get a little closer.




**Interpreter**:

Everything depends on the situation in japan and around the world.



Please go ahead.
[applause]



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
There is a great deal of concern about diagnostic testing.
Some provinces are concerned that not enough testing is being done.
Now these new efforts with Canadian companies.
Will that help? well, yes.
Absolutely.
What we're announcing today will help.
But I can also say that in recent days I've seen new approvals of different types of tests available to the provinces.
We are currently ramping up the number of tests right across the country.
Just in recent days, we saw a huge increase in the number of tests being administered through nay I can't understand and we heard that this is a very important part of preventing the spread of COVID-19 and we'll have enough tests for everyone to meet needs.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
There is concerns that prison facilities are risky vectors for transmitting COVID-19. Some states and other countries have done things to reduce the prison population.
is Canada considering that? and secondarily, yesterday your plan was to detain migrants crossing into Canada crossing facilities and now planning to send back to the United States where they will turn I. C.e. Detention facilities and deported back.
is that wise?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all, on corrections Canada, I can assure you that the Minister of public safety is talk about keeping our incarcerated population safe.
That is something that we understand.
In regards of the agreement, we just worked out with the Americans, we recognize these are exceptional times and someone who comes to the border to request asylum will be turned back to American authorities.
As happens right now when someone comes to an official border crossing and requests asylum, we turn them over to American authorities at the border where they are released almost immediately into the United States.
They are, for the most part, people who are legally in the United States and that is something that we are confident about.
We also have insured that we are comfortable with this process as being in line with Canada's values on the treatment of refugees and vulnerable people.



**Interpreter**:

This is a temporary measure in terms of sending back migrants, trying to cross the border irregularly.
and these would be the same thing for someone coming to the border based on the regular process and requesting asylum.
We send them back to the United States authorities and we are ensuring that the processes use reasonable doubt in keeping with Canadian value.



Thank you.
Merci.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Yes, I'd like to continue [inaudible]. yesterday you announced with respect to roxham road, people would be placed in quarantine.
Why did you change the tone some 24 hours later? is it because you don't know where to put them? are you lacking resources? or do you suddenly have more concerns about possible infection? no, not at all.
People who came in for the beginning of the week are currently in isolation and that is a step we had already put in place.
At the same time, we have been working with our United States counterparts to try and find a way to develop these people somewhat differently.
If think ear crossing the border as irregular migrants.
For a number of years, we've been discussing this with the United States to try and find or develop a measure like this one.
and we were able to work on this process on the temporary basis but of the COVID-19 crisis.
But yesterday we had not yet been able to agree on this with the United States.
Now we have that agreement.
So obviously people who have crossed up until now will be in isolation.
As I said yesterday.
But in future, people trying to cross the border will be returned to the United States authorities.
As I said, this is a mutual agreement with the United States that was reached just a few hours ago.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada addressing Canadian now for the fifth day from his home, Rideau cottage, where he is self-isolating with his family.
Lots of news today.
and lots of it really important to use.
So let's bring in both Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane.
I cut you off, Vassy, so I'll let you go first.



**Vassy**:

Understandably so. Yeah.
I was just in the middle of saying that there is a lot of news out of what the Prime Minister said today.
But primarily I was struck by the statistic that he offered on the number of application for assistance this week, for financial assistance for e. I. 500, 000 this week compared to 27, 000 last week.
I know that we were anticipating that and we knew that something along those lines was coming.
But those numbers are staggering and I anticipate that they will only increase because more programmes are made available.
On the second part, the sort of big, significant things that came out of this, we had talked prior.
David had delivered the news that they would be beginning the effort to repatriate Canadians and he said that the first plane would be coming from morocco over the weekend.
As well, the industry announcement t idea they're going to retool all the programmes that they have to fight and mobilize them to fight COVID-19 and to better prepare Canadians as well as health care workers for what is coming.
As well, the announcement on the agreement with the United States for the restrictions at the border.
That will come into effect at midnight tonight.
I know we'll have a lot to talk about there.
The one thing I wasn't expecting that I'm going to say did take me by surprise is the announcement that another agreement has been reached with the United States to turn back on both sides of the border anybody who crosses in between official points of entry and that is something that we have covered for years and political story, very heated political issue in Ottawa.
But the idea of particularly at roxham road of people who were crossing by foot over those official points of entry.
The conservatives have criticized the government for allowing that or for saying that I could go on. They have always insisted that they were complying with international law.
The Prime Minister was asked repeatedly about it. He says that this still does comply with international law.
It will be interesting to see the reaction to that throughout the day.
He says they have reached this agreement on both sides of border to turn those people back.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
That to me, also stood out as a huge number of Canadians reaching out for assistance.
500, 000 if a week.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised with that number.
But that number is going to grow.
Just today we see air Canada about to lay off 5, 000 people and the Prime Minister trying to re-assure Canadians that the systems, the I. T. systems in place, that they're working hard to make sure that they can handle that capacity.
Let's go to the regular border issue and you covered this extensively as well.
Since 2017, about 54, 000 people have entereded at irregular border entries.
There were a number of people doing that because that was the way to get into Canada without the safe third country agreement being implemented.
I wonder, david, I guess My initial question would be this is temporary.
But given there was so much pressure on the government in the first place to try to shut this down, you have to wonder how is this going to work going forward? this is a significant policy change.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Everything the government is announcing is temporary but has an air of permanence because we have no idea how long any this is going to last.
I think I was there in August of 2016 when the surge of Haitian migrants was coming across the border and we were one of the last camera crews to get unfettered access to the border.
and now there is permanent infrastructure there that didn't exist.
That is a component of the larger theme of what we're seeing through these day by day announcements is the marshalling and funneling of Canada's industrial and human capacity towards a single, solitary purpose.
I think that is slowing and containing and mitigating COVID-19 as much as possible.
Because if you were to allow the safe third country agreement measures to remain in tact and people continue to come across the border at roxham road, at the level -- and who knows what would happen with the COVID-19 situation in the United States, whether or not that would accelerate -- you have to divert border agencies, health care workers, law enforcement and just social capacity to dealing with that particular issue.
So, this takes a variable off the table so you can focus on dealing with your domestic population and what is happening there.
I think that is a key part of what is going on there.



**Rosemary**:

Can I interrupt you for one second on that point.
I think it's so interesting, though.
He said it took 24 hours to reach this agreement with the United States.
When he was asked about it just yesterday there didn't seem to be any movement or flexibility on it at all.
So, not that either of us know the answer to this right now.
I just wonder how this came about so quickly and why such -- I understand what you're saying makes sense in terms of do you want to quarantine a bunch of people.
We didn't know where they were going to go and there were questions about how many people would come across.



**Reporter**:

I have a theory.
I have --



**Rosemary**:

Good.
Because we're already asking the government to do this just in the past couple of days.
Go ahead.



**Reporter**:

If you look at the announcement yesterday, normally the I what it works someone crosses the border in a regular fashion, say at roxham road.
They're intercepted there by the RCMP and put into arrest and brought to a processing centre, which is in the town right next door and then they're sent into Montreal for temporary housing.
Quebec had raised a concern with the federal government saying we can't handle this.
You need to handle this.
and Marco Mendocino, the rookie Minister, was put into charge of this and said the federal government would find the responsibility of finding housing and shelter for people who came across this way and ensuring they were pouting in quarantine.
They took it off the provincial government's plate and put it on the federal government's plate and now putting it back on the American plate and saying we're not going to keep these people.
There is no irregular migration really from Canada to the United States.
it is a northern flow and I think it simply becomes a question of capacity, being overwhelmed by something that is a variable outside of what you're dealing with in terms of--



**Rosemary**:

I hear what you're saying.
It might have been an enormous pressure from Quebec.
Sorry, David.
You wanted to make another point and then I'll move on.



**Reporter**:

No. There's a little bit of news.
You talk about -- the Prime Minister was asked questions about moving from sort of the mitigation measures we're dealing with now to suppression measures based on the extraordinary news out of California that the fifth largest economy in the world is on total shutdown while the governor of new York has now ordered all employees -- employers to keep workers at home exempt essential services and banned gatherings of any size.
Not less than 50, of any size.
So, a border state has taken that measure and, of course, new York is where a lot of people were coming across the board tore get into roxham road.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
Ok. Good information.
I'll come back to you and Vassy in a moment's time.
Let me go to My colleague Chris en sing in Windsor because those border restrictions are going to happen as of midnight tonight.
Meaning that nonessential travel no longer possible between Canada and the United States.
Chris?



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Not a lot of details to further explain any specific measures beyond what we've already heard.
We have been told public safety Minister bill Blair will have an update later when the ministers start briefing.
It will be interesting to see the specifics around there.
a lot of it has to do with essential workers that are going back and forth, the health care industry here in Canada.
There's that desire to have nurses on our frontlines.
The same feeling in Detroit where there is about 2, 000 nurses, health care workers, professionals from Windsor crossing over every single day.
We're expecting to see that continue in the coming days.
Just a pivot here for a second.
We hear about the manufacturers and the ramping up and the change and desire to go into health care mode to try and build supplies and ventilators, masks, gowns.
I was talking to the head of the automotive parts association earlier this week.
and he had talked about there's a strong desire here in windsor-essex for that to happen.
We're an automotive town and we have the manufacturers and the plants and the people who want to make that switch.
But it doesn't necessarily mean it is going to be easy.
We were speaking with one mould maker in windsor who already works in the health care industry, already creating parts.
His concern, though, is staying open with supplis that he needs to make those parts.
He says that it looks pretty thin two weeks from now when he is trying to model out what happens next.
Again, this is an evolving situation with so many different things happening.
But that is from somebody already making parts for the health care industry in windsor-essex.
When we think about that switch and desire for the autoparts makers to step up to the table, there is going to be challenges with that as well as far as where you're sourcing the supply to create those products to then push them forward.
and then the changeover itself.
How quickly and rapidly can all of this happen at a time when workers are worried about their safety, making sure that they're going into the places that they call their careers.
If they're going to shift into something new, they want to make sure they're froekd and following the proper safety measures we've all been told.
Social distance and stay away from others.
We heard from employees worried about that on the frontlines of these industries starting to make that shift.



**Rosemary**:

and one thing that the government is concerned about is the sanitizization of plants.
How do you get from one plant to move to the other because these are big concerns.
Thank you for that.
Chris en sing in Windsor.
I should tell you that the Canadian ambassador to morocco has just tweeted out an urgent message that there are seats on a United States repatriation flight for Canadians from the Marrakesh airport.
The flight leaving in one hour.
If you have someone that you know, you're supposed to look for staff in bright green vests and indeed we have someone in Marrakesh right now.
Simon is about to get on a flight from morocco to the United Kingdom Keenan, I think it was your mom that ended up getting you that flight.
Moms always come through.
Tell us what it has been like for you.



Yeah.
She did.
She was really diligent and refreshing the web pages to get the flight, which is the only way to get a flight right now.
But it has been interesting, to say the least.
Right now Canadians are, until this news you announced about the ambassador, talking about these repatriation flights as well as an e-mail send out about a flight this weekend for canadian citizens.
We've been having more discussions with the embassy to the United Kingdom and france here and getting on their repatriation flight.
In an effort to get out of the country.



**Rosemary**:

So even though your mom came through here to get you out of morocco to the united kingdom, the fact that there are these repatriation flights, seats available for a flight in one hour, or a flight on the weekend, does that make you reconsider what you're about to do now or just going to get the heck out of there?



Well, you know, funny you should ask because I was just put on standby for this flight.
Even though we did the web check-in. There has been -- there has been not a lot of rhyme or reason for a lot of these procedures and the common denominator seems to be that it's a lot of coming by chance.
and the fact that these new flights are announced this weekend and does offer me reassurance.
If I can leave in the next couple of hour and then get on a plane to toronto tomorrow, it will get me home soon.
So that would -- if that is a possibility for me, I'll still get on the plane.



**Rosemary**:

How has it been for you in terms of hearing these messages, come home, come home.
I'm sure your mom is sending you the same message and struggling to get home.
Have you been anxious? give me a sense of how you've been coping with that.



I've been back and forth.
My situation is a little bit better.
I hired some guides here for a trip and they were putting me up and looking after me the past three or four days, which I can't say the same for a lot of other Canadians.
Being a part of the Canadians in morocco Facebook group where we're trying to pull together resources to get out, it has been a lot worse for a lot of people because there's a lot of misinformation, a lot of hearsay spread about how to get on flights and what flights are available.
Flights disappearing because -- or not becoming available because someone enters their credit card information too slow.
and it's like and that is what they were up against for days.
That we need to get home as soon as possible.
and morocco seems to be t*ep centre of impossible travel, or one of them in the world, because all of our international flights back to Canada were halted.
So the only way to get out was through a third country and that is what the embassy was telling us. It doesn't seem to be of much help.
We've been frustrated because we've been getting more responses for the United Kingdom and france in terms of actually getting us on those flights.



**Rosemary**:

a reminder that if you look for a green vest, you may get a flight out in an hour.
If you don't make your other one.
and there is an air Canada flight coming your way on the weekend.
So, you have a few options, which I'm glad to hear for you.



This is very good news.
I'm sure many of us will be relieved because in the past three or four days, it has been incredibly stressful as we need to rely on budget airlines and third countries in order to exit the country.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for making the time.
I appreciate it. I know there's so many Canadians in your position and we hope you get home soon and we'll talk to you on the other side and I'm sure your mom is glad to hear that you are on your way almost.
Thank you.
As we stand by and wait for ministers to join us, let me go back to Dr. Christopher karlston in Vancouver.
The head of respiratory medicine at the university of British Columbia's department of medicine.
Thank you for standing by there.
We heard a lot of pieces of information from the Prime Minister, but obviously from your perspective, the notion that really they're going to throw everything they have at trying to get industry and companies to move over to shore up the medical supply chain.
What did you make of that?



I think it is inspiring, really.
I was happy to hear all of that.
I think everyone should realise, at least on the ground in Vancouver and from My colleagues, there's no sense of panic.
We have been preparing for weeks and what the Prime Minister said is welcomed and I think will help and we're doing everything we can so people should be re-assured that we're going to take care of them.



**Rosemary**:

Given that British Columbia has been dealing with a large number of cases, I think second now to Ontario, how concerned are you about capacity inside hospitals.
You said yourismc.
U. is always full.
Do you feel like you'll have enough room if things do get worse?



Honestly, I'm very confident that we'll make whatever adjustments we need to take care of this population.
I don't have the sense that we are going to have any kind of chaos that people fear, understandly.
We have been preparing potentially 24/7 for this and I want to give credit to the team here in Vancouver.
Incredible people that have dropped everything for this and I'm sure it's true at other places around the country.



**Rosemary**:

Have you treated anyone with COVID-19 so far? tested anyone?



That is the interesting thing.
We have a deep system of coverage and people like me, you can see that I'm at home.
and that is because carefully reserving our staff so that when others get sick and we have had health care workers sick and it will happen, we have people that are healthy and ready to step in. So I've been here at home and I'm on the schedule to jump in shortly and I do expect that will happen.



**Rosemary**:

That is interesting that they'll try to keep you healthy as well.
I'm glad to hear that.
Dr. Christopher carlsten, appreciate all the work.
Let's go to Debra arbec.
There's been lots of interesting developments in Quebec, most notably the use of hotels and their capacity.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
It has been a big concern here in Quebec.
You know, as the numbers grow across the province, where the province will stand in terms of housing all the patients that we might have.
The health Minister this week said that we have 18, 000 beds in Quebec.
But obviously all the COVID-19 cases can't go into those beds.
They are specializing on where to put those COVID-19 patients.
So as we begin to test and begin to see more cases and the number of cases go up significantly, what they're doing is trying to free up beds.
So 6, 000 beds in the health care network, the health care Minister says, will be available.
3, 000 of those, they say, they've come up with this creative way of providing perhaps as many as a 3, 000 beds in hotels.
Now we've confirmed that public health is asking hotels across the province to clear those beds in anticipation of that.
We spoke to hotels association here.
They say they wouldn't take in COVID-19 cases, but rather non affected semi autonomous cases and the rooms would have to be near a hospital.
I want to bring up another big issue that's still getting the message through to people about social distancing and TOEFL isolation here because so many snowbirds are coming back and one island has declared a state of emergency.
There were four case of COVID-19 there.
It's a community with a very large Jewish population and three of those infected had attended a Jewish community centre or synagogue and the fourth case lives in assisted living in cote st. Luck and attended a wedding in the Montreal area not too long ago.
Of course, public health is saying no big gatherings.
Stay away from communitiser and synagogues.
The synagogues on the island of Montreal have agreed to shut down.
We're hearing today, too, that the local mall has agreed to shut down as well.



**Rosemary**:

I didn't want to leave without talking to you about that heart-felt plea on facebook from Quebec's first victim, an older woman and her family did speak out on facebook overnight.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
It's really hitting montrealers and quebecers very hard.
An 82-year-old woman who lived in a seniors home in lanaudiere in the regions just north of montreal.
By all accounts from her family that's posting.
While she did have some respiratory issues.
She did have some health concerns but was otherwise very lucid.
Full of life.
The family, you know, really the pillar of her community k pillar of her family and her grandchildren made that post.
They said that, you know, they said please don't take her death in vein.
They wanted quebecers to understand that this is serious, that people have to self-isolate.
Especially the very vulnerable and high risk group being the elderly and they said, look, they want her death to save other lives.
Very poignant and very touching.
Certainly being shared right across the province.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Debra arbec, thank you.
Appreciate the Quebec perspective.
Appreciate it. and to recap what we heard from the Prime Minister earlier as we stand by now waiting for the ministers to come out and provide us more details.
But let's highlight first of all the first repatriation flight from morocco will be coming back on air Canada this weekend and we heard from someone stuck in marrakech.
That will be welcomed news for Canadians and the government continues to find other ways to bring Canadians back.
Also, the people that are trying to make entry across the border, regular border crossings, that will no longer be permited.
They will be send back to the eye.
That is a significant shift in policy for this government and finally a call for industry and companies to make a shift to try to shore up the medical supply chain in this country, whether it be vent -- ventilator or masks.
The government suggesting that it will help any company that wants to move in that direction.
All right.
That is it for us on CBC television.
Thank you for watching here.
We will continue our coverage both on CBC news network and CBC.
Ca. You can stream that around the world, wherever you are, in case you are in fact stuck and want more information, an update from federal health ministers -- ministers, rather, and the chief public health officer coming up in a few moments here on CBC news network.
As we leave you with scenes across this country of the COVID-19 pandemic change lives here.



**Rosemary**:

Hi, welcome back to our continuing coverage on CBC news network or online streaming in this country or around the world.
We're standing by to bring you federal ministers who are going to come out and tell us more about some of the measures the Prime Minister announced today.
As well as the chief public health officer, Dr. Tam.
Some significant moves again today by the government to try and hope Canadians, to try and restrict and contain the spread of the virus and to move industry and companies in this country towards shoring up how they can help.
I'll bring in My colleague, Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
They have been helping us through these specials, through the week, as the Prime Minister speaks to Canadians on a daily basis now.
Partly to re-assure people, but also to provide specific information and we'll hear more details from the prime ministers.



**Vassy**:

You talked about the shoring up of capacity on the supply chain where all industries are concerned.
Expect some details from him on that.
I'm primarily looking to Minister Blair for details on two things that came WWW of the press conference from the Prime Minister.
The first thing is that agreement will come into effect.
The agreement on border restrictions between Canada and the United States this evening, or overnight at midnight.
Apparently president trump has been talking while we have been saying that the Mexican border will be treated -- I know he tweeted something to that effect -- but will be tweeted exactly the same, insisting that he does treat those two borders equally.
I'll be looking for the exact details because we have been given very specific signals from the government, such that, for example, what they are limiting is people trying to travel for leisure or just travel, period.
But that other essential services, workers for example, truck and trade, all of that stuff will be able to pass.
Let's get the fine print.
I'm anticipating that from Minister Blair.
The second thing I'm interested to see from Minister Blair t Minister of public safety, is around that sort of surprise announcement from the Prime Minister that people who attempt to cross irregularly between points -- official points of entry, which has been an issue for years in this country, will be turned back and he said that that agreement was reached with the Americans over the last 24 hours.
He and other members of his government, the Prime Minister I should say and other members of his government have insisted that instead those people would be quarantined.
For years they have insisted that the announcement they made today couldn't happen and didn't comply with international legal standards.
How it unfolded, what exactly it means, how long it lasts, what does that word temporary that they actually used means.
Those are the specific questions that I have for Minister Blair.



**Rosemary**:

So people understand.
If you are trying to cross the border at an official point of entry because of the safe first country agreement, you will be turned back.
That is how that goes.
People went to those irregular crossings, whether it be in Quebec and Manitoba.
There, the argument is if you are claiming refugee status under that, international treaties, Vassy, then government of Canada does have to take you in and obviously this huge flux of people did come as a result of some of the measures that the trump administration put in place.
I should say one of My colleagues has reached out to the Canadian council for refugees and their spokesperson, Janet dench, says, quote, we're shocked that the government of Canada is not prepared to live up to its commitment to protect the rights of refugees and vulnerable migrant.
I would remind people that the government says this is a temporary measure and obviously unusual -- extremely unusual situation and they're trying to contain a public health outbreak -- a public health virus.
But we can already see some of the criticism about that decision.
Day, do you want to talk about that and maybe a little bit about the repatriation of Canadians? I thought it was really interesting to talk -- we spoke earlier with a young man stuck in Marrakesh saying that he really hadn't had a lot of communication from the embassy there and he was feeling a little bit left to his own devices.



**Reporter**:

It sounds like the flood of demand for communication at every level of government is overwhelming at a time like this and seems like they aren't saying anything unless they're ready to do so specific.
Clearly there is a flight coming back from morocco and they are talking to west jet and air Canada to do more.
You said it right.
The Prime Minister comes out and gives us the message and then the ministers come out and give us the mechanics.
But I want to see how quickly they think they can fill up our medical stockpiles.
I'm getting yelled at a little bit on Twitter for something I said on Twitter.
I want to clarify.
When I said there are strategic stockpiles with some surge capacity around the country, that is true.
This is something that was set up on the public health agency was created.
The res a warehouse here in the Ottawa region with warehouses spread out across the country with pharmaceutical and medical gear that can deal with a crisis.
and they decided to backstop that even more and now tilting up the industrial capacity.
I don't want to give people the false impression there is a huge stockpile of gear there because it expiresful you can't do it. But I also don't mean to give you the impression that they haven't been taking steps to prepare and now taking extreme steps to extremely prepare because that is just the way it is. You go back to the fact that the whole world is look for the same gear.
You can't stockpile because Italy or china would have needed it.



**Rosemary**:

I would also say that the public health agency, Dr. Tam said we're about 75% of the supplies that we knee.



**Reporter**:

On masks and gloves.
The need for seven million and we have a little over five million secured.



**Rosemary**:

and if there are doctors who don't have what they need in hospitals, that could be a provincial problem because they haven't, you know, sent it out to where I needs to be. and I would also say that the people that I've spoken to around this, David, have said that if they don't know, if they're not sure they have enough, they will buy everything and create everything they can.
This is not a situation the government says where it's going to be cheap, for lack of a better phrase.
They're going to take everything.



**Reporter**:

and a key point yesterday, too, was that Dr. Tam said they have an emergency reserve of ventilators, which they're looking to backstop.
To this point, there's been no request from a province for a ventilator.
While that is a big piece of equipment, we're all looking at and tracking and saying how many do we need, how many do we have? at this point they look toward getting more and more built or bough or refurbished.
There hasn't been a draw-down yet on the national stockpile at the provincial level.



**Rosemary**:

and probably important to realise that, after SARS and as you say, day, when the public health agency was created at that time period, there was, again, the need to start making sure that there were ventilators available in stockpiles.
So, that work has been happening presumably for years in some ways.
I'm going leave Vassy and David for one minute as we stand by and wait for the ministers and try to quickly fit in tom Murphy, the host of CBC Nova Scotia news and he is in Halifax.
Thomas, I cut you off a. You eel understand why.
Give us a picture of how things are going Nova Scotia.



**Reporter**:

It's interesting to watch this repatriation of Canadians happen in real time on your programme like so many.
I'm receiving e-mails from people.
In this case, a family has a loved one stuck in peru.
The last couple of days, not much hope.
But this morning, they are expressing some relief.
Help is on the way.
This is before the Prime Minister spoke and they are crediting local politicians and federal politicians for working the back channels and making this happen.
Also interesting to hear the conversation about the medical supplies thing.
Like every province, Nova Scotia has gone through its complete inventory.
It knows where every glove, band-aid and ventilator is. We have 240 ventilators in this province and the premier has said they are ordering more to a national procurement-type plan if I can put it that way.
Probably another 140 that they need.
There are ventilators that are -- had been piled up since the h1n1 and sars days so I that had been restocking.
The question is who do they get to operate this equipment if they need to get to that point.
To that end, the Nova Scotia nurses union says they have been getting a lot of phone calls from nurses, retired nurses and doctors in the case of medical doctors willing to come back into the system to work.
To fill in. Maybe they don't some of the -- in the middle of a fire of COVID-19, but maybe they can help out at nursing homes and free up some of the staff there to move to hospitals and that kind of thing.
So those discussions are happening right now.
Obviously those are a lot of people very dedicated to their careers and to the work of medical industry and medical system.
That kind of thing is. Haing as well.
and interesting to hear people talk about what can we do to help? we've seen this cross the country and happening in Nova Scotia.
Distill ris.
Let's make alcohol with a higher content that becomes like a hand sanitizer and they will doing and that lots of encouragment for other companies as you heard from the Prime Minister today to do those sorts of thing as well.
On the point about social distancing, the hand wark and people in self-ice lace, in this province at least t premier has said we believe things are going pretty well.
Although they see indications that maybe not everyone is falling as much as they are because they keep repeating that message.
In New Brunswick, they have declared a state of emergency in that province because they felt that they needed to become more aggressive.
That is shuiing down nonessential businesses.
Shutting down pharmacies and that kind of thing.
So they were really trying to, you know, wrangle this in, wrangle the crowd in and get everyone on the same page with that.
and finally this notion about the border, it is obviously an issue in New Brunswick, a border community.
Next to the state of maine.
Some people live in New Brunswick, work in maine, vice versa so lots of attention and interest in what the ministers say about that coming up.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Tom Murphy in Halifax.
Appreciate it very much.
Good to get perspective from out east and good to see you.
I should tell people, tom mentioned there repatriation of Canadians.
I, too, have received me mails from people begging, you know, me for help and information.
I should tell you that the United States state department is starting to put together charter flights for Americans stranded both in morocco and Peru and we know that that first flight will leave from morocco over the weekend.
So, if you have someone stuck in morocco, make sure they reach out.
In fact, there is a flight leaving in an hour.
If you are at the airport right now.
This is the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland.
Let's listen in now to what she and her colleagues have to say.



Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.



Thank you for being here.




**Interpreter**:

Before I begin, I would simply like to thank everyone who is working so hard to protect Canadians against this global pandemic.
People who are working in hospitals, physicians, people who are working at the borders, everyone working at airports to help Canadians come home.
and would also like to thank -- especially like to thank all Canadian children because, as a mother, ii that very personally.
I know that it's a difficult situation for our children.
So, thank you very much to all of you.



I'd like to quickly thank all of the people who are in Canada's front line fighting against this global pandemic.
I'd like to thank nurses, the doctors, all of the public health workers, all of the health workers, the border service officers, airport workers and especially today the cabin and flight crews and pilots who have been helping to get Canadians hole.
and speaking very personally, I would like to thank Canada's children and sympathize with themful as a motor, I have some sense of how hard it is for all of our children to be home in a time of social distancing.
Having a long school holiday may have seemed fun when it was first announced, but when it also includes learning that you can't have play dates and can't spend time with your friends, it's really hard for our children and I just want to say to them thank you very very much.
Ok. So, today, we are going to hear from Canada's chief public health officerdr.
Tam.
We will hear from our Minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, bill Blair, who will talk about the Canada -- United States border.
He will be assisted by our Minister of the treasury board.




**Interpreter**:

My colleague, the vice president of the cabinet committee on COVID-19.



Minister of industry, science and innovation, navdeep Bains will will talk about building up our industrial capacity and we'll hear from the Minister of public services and procurement who will be talking about the work we're doing on procurement and our Minister of health, Minister patty hajdu is here and Dr. Njoo as well and they're here to answer questions.
Dr. Tam.



Thank you, and hello, everyone.
Before I begin, I would like to express My deepest condolences to the family of the Canadian who recently passed away in japan.
The former passenger aboard the diamond princess.
Our thoughts are with you and many others who have lost a loved one to this disease.
Both at home and abroad.
Today, globally, there are over 245, 000 cases of COVID-19 in over 179 countries.
In Canada, as of this moment, there are 925 cases and 12 deaths.
There are now 12 cases at c. F.b. Trenton.
We have tested close to 66, 000 people across Canada.
That is, again, over 10, 000 persons tested since yesterday.
Public health colleagues continue to inv*e gait unlinked cases to uncover hidden xhains of transmission in the community.
One of our biggest concerns introduced into the high-risk setting such as a long-term care facility.
These settings are not only a concern due to the older and medically vulnerable populations that they serve but also because a single case arising in these settings can quickly result in an outbreak and accelerate the rate of spread.
If we are to slow the spread and lessen the impact of COVID-19, we must protect these settings at all costs.




**Interpreter**:

One of the main reasons we want to delay and flatten the epidemic curve is to gain time to allow for research and innovation to proceed.
We have an urgent need of -- rather we have an urgent need for under enlt medical suppl is if we want to optimize our chances of saving lives and to put an end to this epidemic.
We must not forget that only two and a half months ago, scientists isolated the coronavirus stream at an unbelievable speed.
and the first development of vaccine against COVID-19 has begun this week.
It is still too soon to know whether or how COVID-19 will develop over the next months but by increasing our domestic capacity domestically, that will be a key element for a fight against this pandemic and this will serve us to date and in future.



One of the key reasons we wanted to delay and flatten this epidemic curve is to buy time because we desperately need equipment and vaccines if we want a chance to save lives and bring this epidemic to an end.
It was only two and a half months ago that scientists first isolated and novel ed the sequence of coronavirus with lightning speed.
This week, the first clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine started and an array of treatment are being tested.
It is too soon to know what will happen to COVID-19 in the upcoming months, but mobilizing our domestic production capacity and integrating ingenuity as part of our response will serve us well now and into the future.
We don't just need to flatten the curve as asaid.
We need to plank it and Canadians are listening.
Everyone who is practicing social distancing and self-isolation is is giving a chance to our scientists, manufacturers and governments to work together on novel solutions.
This is our chance right here, right now.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Now we will hear from Minister bill Blair about the border measures.



Thank you very much, Chrystia.
I'd like to begin as well as the deputy Prime Minister did by acknowledging and thanking all the people that are working on the front lines.
Police officers, e. M.s., firefighters, nurses, border officers, corrections officials, doctors, caregivers, even the people that drive our goods to the shelves and those working in stores have stayed on the frontline and continued to serve Canadians and we're endebted to them and it is important to express our gratitude for the incredible work that they are doing in difficult circumstances.
It is also important to acknowledge and thank Canadians who have taken, I think, such care in heeding the advice of our chief public health officers so seriously.
I know that is also bringing challenges to families and to people across the country but they are working hard and doing the right things.
By staying home and participating in social distancing, they are not only keeping th*emgs and loved ones safe, but helping keep the country safe.
For that, we are grateful.
We have over the past few weeks announced progressive and significant measures to restrict travel across our borders and these decisions, I want to are assure everyone, have not been made lightly.
We know this has been made challenging for Canadians but we believe it is part of a larger group of measures as advised and directed by our public health officials in order to keep Canadians safe.
In response to the ongoing pandemic, we took the steps necessary to restrict international air travel for noncanadians.
We have entered into an agreement with our most important ally and partner, the United States, a reciprocal agreement to temporarily restrict all nonessential travel across the Canada-United States border.
This agreement will take effect at 11:59 tonight.
I also want to acknowledge, since we announced these measures and officials have worked tirelessly to put them into effect, Canadians and americans have been listening and we've seen a significant decline over the past 24 hours in nonessential travel at that border.
At the same time, I have been very, very encouraged to see the extraordinary work of truck drivers, train operators, marine operators and others who have continued the important work of delivering goods and services across that border and that work will continue unimpeded.
I also want to reiterate that we acknowledge indigenous community, which often exist on both sides of the Canada-United States border.
I want to offer them reassurance that we recognize and acknowledge their right to travel and it is essential and will continue unimpeded during this restriction.
Canadians and americans cross the border each and every day to do essential work.
We acknowledge the importance of that work and we'll make sure we facilitate the crossing of border so they can continue to do the job that served and keep healthy and safe.
Canadians and americans.
As I indicated, trade and supply will continue because it's critical to our health and safety and will facilitate our economic recovery.
Today the Prime Minister made a significant announcement as a result of the continuing work we're doing in working with our allies and partners in the United States to keep our citizens safe.
The Prime Minister announced that we have entered into a reciprocal arrangement with the United States to direct back individuals who come to our borders with the purpose of making an asylum claim.
I want to be clear that individuals crossing at an irregular point of entry, not at a regular point of entry as they exist, but in any other place, will now be directed back to the unite.
They will not be referred to the immigration board and into our immigration board system, but they will be returned directly back to the unite.
There will be necessary and limited exceptions put in place but I also want to be very clear.
We are taking this measure to maintain safety and order at our border and, at the same time, these measures will only be in place temporarily, as long as the agreement of the restrictions on nonessential remain in place.
We believe that these measures are appropriate and necessary.
They will be reciprocal so individuals crossing from Canada into the United States or the United States into Canada will be treated the same.
They will be returned, directed back to the United States and for those individuals who are already across the border and have already entered into our system, we have made the appropriate arrangements so that those individuals will continue through the process, but they will be accommodated in temporary shelter, which is appropriate to enforce the 14-day period of isolation, which is necessary to ensure that they are safe and that Canadians are safe from their crossing.
That work has been done and will continue to be done and we will monitor that issue very carefully as we proceed forward and as I indicated it will be in place effective at 11:59 this evening and will continue from the 30-day period subject to renewal as long as it is necessary to maintain the temporary restriction on nonessential travel between our two countries.
Thank you very much, Chrystia.



Thank you very much, bill.




**Interpreter**:

These measures are important for all Canadians and have particular significance for Quebec.
Would you like to address that?



Yes.
Thank you, Chrystia.
and like everyone else, I would like to thank all of our front line workers doing extraordinary work and I also have a thought for children who are very anxious as well.
They are also isolated and I should know because I have three at home.
and they are extremely troubled by the situation.
So I would like to reach out to all of our children and to re-assure them that we must try to help each other in these difficult circumstances.
I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Minister blair for his extraordinary work in these extraordinary times.
As we said, these extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and as Minister blair has indicated, everything that is being done has been done over the past few days is being expedited, the clowing of the border in the United States.
That has never happened in the hit toyer of our country.
These restrictions on the entry of the foreigners has been done very quickly and aye like to thank Minister blair once again and just to point out once again that all asylum seekers, regardless where they come across, if it is a regular point of entry, they will be directed back to the United States.
This is a reciprocal arrangement that has been signed with our neighbour to the south.
and will come into force at 11:59. and Minister blair has also indicated that for all regular asylum seekers as we have announced earlier this week, they will be taken into custody by canadian authorities so there is no jurisdictiontal quibble and our federal government is taking responsibility for these regular asylum seekers who are ready.
They will be placed in isolation for 14 days just like all over travelers.
Thank you.



Thank you.
and now we'll hear from Navy about how Canadian science and industry are stepping up to the challenge and the work Navy has been doing there.
Please.



Thank you.
Have, Chrystia.
I want to begin, as My colleagues have said, taking a moment to recognize the incredible work of our nurses, doctors, technicians, paramedics and other health care professionals.
They are on the front lines of this and they're doing a remarkable job.
So, thank you very much.




**Interpreter**:

I would also like to thank people who don't just work in the health care system, but working hard to ensure access to essential goods and services.
For example, truck drivers, people who work in grocery stores and telecom workers who are supporting the telework economy.
Among others.
Thank you very much for the support that you are providing toeing to other Canadians.



We're commit ed to protecting the health and safety of all Canadians and the effort includes the impressive and innovative power of Canadian businesses.
Since the outset of this crisis, My team has connected with thousands and thousands of businesses across all sectors in Canada.
Companies are already stepping up like dylan's, in the spirit of their distilleries who have shifted their production to hand sanitizers.
As the Prime Minister said, in times of crisis, Canadians come together and every day I've been in contact with Canadian businesses.
Many of whom are telling me they want to help.
As we've always known, we have a world-class industrial base in Canada.
and today I'm asking them to come forward and let us know where they can help.
Our objective is to increase domestic supply so that we have canadian solutions ready to protect and support Canadians.
So today, we're announcing Canada's plan to mobilize industry to fight COVID-19. Which will swiftly create pathways to deploy resources to canadian businesses two want to help in this crisis.
This is a coordinated strategy that will leverage our industrial base to rapidly scale twars more canadian production in the products that we need to fight COVID-19. I work in close collaboration with the Minister of health and Minister of public services and procurement to mobilize our industrial response and I want to thank My colleagues and their team for doing a wonderful job.




**Interpreter**:

This plan will mobilize our innovation programmes to support projects, projects that will foster the protection of all Canadians.



For the time being to prioritize the fight against COVID-19. This includes the extra edge topic innovation fund to deliver direct support to larger companies as well as research institutions.
Canada's national research council to expedite research and development for small and medium-sized enterprises and superclusters to tap into the national network of 1800 members.
and inknow evade tiff solutions Canada to help canadian companies commercialize faster.
Funds will be deployed on an accelerated basis with wider flexibility to be able to tackle COVID-19 related problems through shortened applications and faster approvals.
We are putting the full weigh of the federal government behind this plan.
We will also leverage the purchasing power for the government to boost the need of capacity and make sure that canadian innovations get to the market faster.
and I know My colleague will speak to that momentarily.
Companies responding to the call to action will be able to directly let us know of their capables via portal on My department's website, which will go live today.




**Interpreter**:

We want researchers, industry and business people to get down to work right away.
Their work will progress as quickly as possible.



We've signed letters of intent with three companies that we believe are well-pentagoned to assist.




**Interpreter**:

First of all, the medicom, a Montreal business, which manufacturers and distributes protective medical equipment that is for individuals such as masks and lab coats.
They have agreed to manufacture n-95 masks.



Medicine, diagnostic equipment manufacture headquarters in Ottawa which is developing a version of its port cal diagnostic device to provide rapid results for COVID-19. If successful, its diagnostic platform could be used in airports and in clinics.
The device could read with a test result in potentially 30 minute and we're work to secure supply of this equipment.
and thorn hill medical.
a ventilator manufacturer in Toronto that has stepped up and is moving forward to say they will do whatever it takes to rapidly scale up their production and help Canadians' health care systems succeed going forward.
We are also working closely with the auto parts manufacturer association of Canada.
and I want to particularly acknowledge flavio vole in his endeavour.
To have the auto sector temporarily retool their facilities to build a range of products that could help us in the fight of COVID-19. There are skilled workers out there that want to help and companies offering their facilities and this is what our plan is about.
It's about aligning those employees, those individuals who want to help and those companies that have the production capabilities.
These are extraordinary times and when we work together, Canadians are capable of extraordinary things.
So let me sum it up. We want our health care professionals to focus on doing life-saving work without worrying about the supply of medical equipment and our plan will ensure that we do exactly that.
We want Canadians to know that, as solutions are offered, we will invest to make sure that more domestic capacity is online as quickly as possible.




**Interpreter**:

The government is acting swiftly, right now.
We are using all the tools available to protect Canadians' health and support our economy and businesses.
We will adapt our response to the situation which continues to evolve.



We are acting in a co-ordinated and meaningful way to address short-term needs and also set up the foundation for long-term domestic capability.
and I have every confidence that, in working together, with the canadian business community, we will be able to deliver breakthrough solutions, retool where we can and scale up to meet the needs during this crisis and for the future.
Thank you very much.
Merci.



Ok. Well, thank you very much, Navy.
and I think it provides real hope to all of us to see Canadian science and industry stepping up in these challenging times.
Ok. Anita, Maui you can talk to us about the work you are doing on procurement.



Thank you.
Thank you so much, Chrystia and Navy.
Bonjour.
 I want to re-assure Canadians that we are working hard to address the challenges of this extraordinary situation.
We are all hands on deck to support a whole of government response.
I, too, would like to thank Canadians across the country for the work that you are doing to keep our country safe, especially frontline workers.
I'm going to, today, provide a brief ohio valley overview of how public services and procurement Canada is working in collaboration with other departments, some of the steps that we have taken and how we are moving forward to help secure the goods and services that Canadians need.




**Interpreter**:

Over the past weeks, health Canada and the public health agency have co-ordinated requests for supplies coming from provinces and territories as well as federal organisations such as the RCMP.



They are leading the consolidated procurement's of goods and services.
We have stood up a dedicated team of procurement specialists who work incredibly hard each and every day and I want to say thank you to them.
With counterparts at health Canada and public health who are working together to source suppliers, work up contracting and delivery schedules and expedite decision making in these times.
We are taking a whole of government approach and team Canada approach to best meet Canada's needs during this extraordinary time.
Now to ensure that we have left no stone unturned, we published a call to action for suppliers on buy and sell.
GCC.
Ca last Thursday.
We are inviting companies to fill out a simple form to provide information on their goods or services, including the quantities that they have in stock.




**Interpreter**:

We have promoted this to industry associations and all parliamentarians and we are -- so that they can communicate this to suppliers in their communities.



and circulate it to all parliamentarians and together we have had 5800 submissions from companies offering goods or services to combat COVID-19 and we've been working very hard to triage these.
However, the situation is fluid and evolving rapidly.
Our goal is to be overprepared.
We are planning for the future by considering both current and anticipated needs as much as possible.
For example, we have been able to secure 11.3 million n-95 masks which is over and above the order that we received for 7.3 million.
With deliveries beginning immediately.




**Interpreter**:

Thank you to the success of this call for tender and our current relationships with suspect players, we have been able to purchase a wide range of protective equipment and supplies.
Including gloves, masks, lab coats, hand sanitize and ventilators as well as thermometers.
Among other things.
Some supplies have already been delivered, whereas the rest will soon follow.



Through the success of the call-out and our existing relationships with suppliers, we have been able to purchase a broad range of personal protective equipment and supplies, including gloves, masks, gowns, hand sanitizers, wipes, ventilators anther momer thes amongst many others.
Certain supplies have already been delivered while others will follow.
In many cases, we are securing any available supply, including smaller quantity purchases to ensure that we have what we need.
 french

We have made considerable progress, but we know that the global demand for these products will continue to climb.
and matters such as border restrictions around the world may affect the supply chain as we have already seen the situation will continue to evolve and we will adapt to it, accordingly.



Pspc will continue to work with industry to explore flexible and innovative procurement approaches in other -- in order to meet requirements.
We are also looking at how to strengthen and secure our own stockpile and domestic supply of essential goods.
In times of crisis, we all come together and that is exactly what we are doing.
Merci.beaucoup.
Thank you.



Ok. Thank you very much, Anita.
We're now ready to answer questions.

Mr. Blair on ms. Freeland, with the border open to truckers and essential workers, what are you doing to make sure that, as they go back and forth, they're not bringing the virus with them.
What are the screening measures?



Actually, we have given advice to those truckers.
First of all, they practice the recommended and appropriate hygiene measures of washing their hands frequently and engaging in social distancing.
We are also giving them advice on what to do, should they become symptomatic and they are routinely being checked as they cross the border to determine if they are, in fact, symptomatic.
We're monitoring that situation very, very carefully, but we know the importance of the movement of that trade and so we are facilitating essential workers going back and forth across the border, asking that they self-monitor for any symptoms which would be concerning and then reference them immediately to health officials should they become symptomatic and practice the appropriate measures to make it far less likely that they would be exposed to the elements.



We are also hearing about Canadians heading back on airplanes who, I guess we thought they would be more ranger right newly screened before they got on flights but we're hearing numerous examples of people who board flights coming back to Canada that aren't being screened.
Should we be worry about that? or is something going to change? this is what we're being told.



Let me be clear.
The airlines have a duty to care to all of their passengers, not to board people who are obviously symptomatic and possibly ill.
and we are assured that that work is happening.
We're also asking them to make observations during flight and to the person present as symptomatic, that information? conveyed to our agents on the ground.
Those individuals will be met on the plane, immediate segregated from the other passengers on that plane and I can assure you as well when each and every person arrives in Canada from any place in the world now, they are screened to determine if they are symptomatic and asked very specifically if they are experiencing symptoms or if they have been in a region where the illness is particularly prevalent and, in every case, they're asked -- there's now signage up at every airport.
The officers are asking the question, they're all -- all returning passengers are required to fill out a form and indicate that they are not symptomatic and that they have been advised of the need to self-isolate for 14 days.
We also have agents wandering in passenger processing areas, making observations of individuals, passing out public health information and taking such observations such as to screen in their own observations anyone who may be symptomatic.
I will tell you the measures that have been put in place.
They are very vigorous.
I've heard from countless Canadians who have told me about their experiencing, returning snowbirds that when they cross the border, they're dealt with professionally and they're asked the questions that we have directed our agents to ask and, you know, the work is being done and is taking place.
