The first question from Teresa wright, the Canadian press.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Could you please tell me when you expect the Americans to decide how they will or will not deploy their military in order to assist their border patrol?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As I said, Canada and the United States benefit immensely from the fact that we share the longest, unmilitarized border in the world.
We have expressed to the United States that it would be a mistake to position troops near the Canadian border and we certainly hope that they're not going to go through with that.



**Reporter**:

Has the government received formal confirmation that the United States will not host troops at the border?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We continue to engaugesing closely with back and forth with the American administration on many, many issues around the border and when we have more information, we'll share it. 



**Interpreter**:

Both Canadians and Americans have a great benefit in the fact that we share the longest demilitarized border in the world.
and it is in our interests to continue to have that.
That is exactly what we have expressed to the United States administration.
and this is what we continue to work on.



Thank you, Merci.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Could you let us know whether some of these amounts will be taxable? and I'd also like to know what more your government can do to help the media during this crisis.
We recently saw that they were in difficulty.
The Canadian national response benefit will be an income benefit like e. I. and will be taxable.
However, we will not be taking money off at source so people will receive the entire amount immediately and because we have a progressive tax system, we will be able to ensure that the people who need it most will benefit from it at the very -- as much as possible.



Thank you.
Merci.
The next question is from the Toronto star". your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Just with these new measures that you're announcing, can you give us a sense of the cost and I'd also like to know, given that the budget was originally scheduled for next Monday, I believe.
When are we going to see a fiscal accounting of all these spending measures and a fiscal update or a budget?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We announced today that we will be supporting small and medium-sized businesses with payroll support up to 75% for qualifying businesses.
We know that this is going to be a significant measure of investing in Canadians and in businesses so that we can bounce back from the difficult times we're going through right now both on the health side and on the economic side.
We recognize that these are unprecedented investments in the economy.
But we also know that they are necessary.
They are necessary because woe have to get through these coming months of restricted economic activity where people stay at home and work from home or don't go to work as much as possible, focus on keeping their families safe.
But if we can support businesses to keep that relationship with their employees, to keep being able to pay their employees through this time, we know that coming out of this vie sister -- crisis will be smoother and better than otherwise.
That is our focus right now.
In terms of accountability, we will, of course, as was passed in parliament earlier this week, be engaging regularly with members of the opposition, with the finance committee and a ensuring that people are I seeing exactly what we're doing.
We know that transparency around the investments we're making to support Canadians is important not just from a democratic or parliamentary principle, but important in giving confidence to Canadians that this government will be there for them while they do what is necessary to keep themselves, their families, their neighbours safe and ensure that we can come out of this stronger than ever before.



Thank you.
Merci.




**Interpreter**:

Mr. Trudeau, I'd like to hear more about today's announcement.
Are you in the position to tell us how s. M.e. S could be helped by this and how many employees and also how much it will cost?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

Well, right now we're finalizing the details and we expect to be able to provide all that information by Monday.
I can assure you that whatever initiatives we need to take for p. M.e. S will really help them to keep their employees on payroll, to continue to pay them, even though there is very little work to be done.
So, for example a family restaurant that has been in place for many, many years and has had the same employees for many, many years and have been with them through the good times and bad times and now in the midst of this crisis, they find themselves unable to pay those employees when they need the money most.
So we need to be there for them.
Yes, the Canada emergency response benefit will help a great many people who need it. When possible, it is better for everyone that we keep that connection between employers and employees so that people can know that they will still have a job, even though they're not working and that they will be able to go back to that job.
But especially we will all be able to come out of this crisis quickly when the time comes.
We need people to feel re-assured that the economy will recover and not only can we keep ourselves safe, but we can also get things back to normal and continue to have an extraordinary country right here in Canada.
and that is what we're going to be doing.
Now with respect to the cost, of course that will depend on the decisions we make with respect to the design of the programme.
But we can tell you that we will do whatever is necessary to help businesses affected by COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that there is more design work to be done on this and we'll have details hopefully by Monday so people can make those decisions to keep people on the payroll, to even rehire people to be back on the payroll.
Because we're thinking about that family-owned restaurant that's been around for years and had many of the same employees for years.
Employees who have been there through slowdowns, good times and bad times and now this this moment of crisis, they're having to lay these people off.
At their time of need.
We know that allowing people to continue that relationship, allowing people to continue to feel and to know that they have a job, and allow employers to keep supporting those familis who work with them is a really important thing.
Not just for people's confidence, but for the ability of all of us to bounce back strongly from this once we're throw it. -- there it. We need people to focus taking care of themselves and their families and not worrying about what the future will bring.
There's plenty of worry for right now in terms of keeping safe.
That is why we're focused on being there for you.
With the three measures that we're announcing today with the Canada emergency response benefit and the payroll support of up to 75% and significant access to credit for businesses that are squeezed, we are demonstrating that we are there for you to help us through this moment so we can come back once we're all safer, stronger than ever before.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

As a follow-up, could you comment on the scenario that there would be a $7 billion deficit in 2021 and that is not counting all the measures announced previously and announced today.
What do you say to Canadians who see the deficit exploding and may be worried about that? Canada was in a very good fiscal position before this.
We had the best economic and fiscal position of any country in the world with g. D.p.-to-debt ratio that is very, very low and which is exactly what allows us to take the necessary measures now, feeling fully confident of our ability to help people in this emergency.
This is completely unprecedented situation that requires that we invest to help people, to help small businesses, to help employers and particularly to help workers and their families and that is exactly what we're doing.
We are confident about Canada's ability to survive and we know if we can come through this, this difficult period, by remaining healthy and doing what we need to do to protect ourselves, we will be able to return to the prosperous economy we had before.
We must ensure that we're there to support each other in these difficult times.
So we can rebuild our economy and make this stronger when this is over.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that these are exceptional times that have required exceptional measures of supporting Canadians, of small businesses and the economy at a time of almost total economic slowdown and shutdown.
But we also know that Canada's fundamentals are strong.
We have one of the best balance sheets in the g7 which a -- allows us to make the investments we need to keep Canadians focus on what they need to do right now -- stay home, take care of their families and look out for their loved ones with the confidence that our economy will bounce back strongly.
If we make sure that people can do the things they can without worrying about the future, there's plenty to worry about right now, about today.
Focus on the things you need to do today and know that your job will be there, that your relationship with your employer continues, that we're going to support you through this time and we can come back stronger than ever before afterwards.
That is in the responsibility of the government of Canada, of all governments in Canada right now.
and that is what we're focusing on. With the measures that we have announced until now, the Canada emergency response benefit, this payroll support to 75% and the access to credit for businesses to see them through this time, we know we are positioning ourselves not just to be able to do the things we need to do right now to keep our country safe, but we will be able to come back from this stronger than before.
Afterwards.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Radio-Canada.
You have access to projections and numbers and scenarios and there are people who are sitting at home right now wondering how long they're going to have to stay home.
What can you say to Canadians about how long this will take, how long will they have to make economic sacrifices to save lives? could this last until summer? well, we're seeing a lot of different potential scenarios.
Some are more pessimistic, they're longer than others.
But all of this will depend on the choices that Canadians make now and the choices they've made recently and the choices they'll make in the coming days.
If we continue to follow the advice of experts and stay home and limit our travel to protect ourselves, and protect our loved ones, we can come out of this more quickly.
Now what will it look like? how long will it last? we know we're talking about weeks and possibly months.
But as we see whether or not we're able to flatten the curve if we're able to control the spread of the virus, then we'll be able to predict with greeter certainty how long people will be stuck in this protectionist mode.
Now we know that we will have to do everything we can to come through this and we will be there for as long as it takes.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There are obviously many, many different projections of how long this could last, how serious this could be, how many cases we could be facing.
But those projections all hinge on choices that Canadians are making today.
Choices they made over the past few days.
Choice they will be making over the coming few days.
I'm incredibly comforted by the number of Canadians who are taking this seriously and protects themselves, their loved ones and by extension our health care workers and essential workers who are so important in this time of crisis and the measures that we've announced and the measures we're announcing today will ensure that Canadians are better able to do the things necessary to keep their families safe in this difficult time.
So we will be able to say more about how many weeks or months this lasts for as we see the impacts of the behaviours that people have engaged over these days.
But I am very optimistic that we're going get through this in the right way because Canadians do what they need to do to be there for each other and keep us all safe.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Now should we expect an economic update before a budget? and if so, why? well, we'll continue to be trans important about the measures we're putting forward.
We are currently investing and giving aid directly to Canadians and small businesses and we also need to help some major corporations, inspectors that have been very hard hit by this crisis.
So we've done a lot but we still have more to do and at every step we will be transparent about what we're doing so that people can understand, so people can have confidence and also so that parliamentarians can do their job and ensure that the government is doing what should be done to help Canadians.



**Reporter**:

At a time when you're rolling out all these programmes that require Canadians to interact with government, you're closing service Canada centres across the country.
I'm wondering why that decision was taken now at this time and what is your message to people who might have trouble accessing government services, particularly people who are seniors and people living in indigenous communitis?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past years, we have made significant efforts to ensure what is at the Canada service centres is able to be and more able to be accessed online.
As part of the initiative of encouraging people to stay home and work from home, this is something we realise we can and should be doing.
We want to make sure that service Canada employees are continuing to work extremely hard to serve Canadians and respond to their needs and that is why things will be done online and through the phone and we will be making special considerations for people who are particularly vulnerable and have difficulties accessing those services.



**Interpreter**:

We recognize that we need to be able to serve citizens during these difficult times.
But for some time now, service Canada offices have been making those services totally available online or in person.
But now that we are asking people to stay home and work from home, we expect people at service Canada to continue to serve Canadians from home.
Of course, there will be additional measures taken to help those who cannot access to t phone or online services.



**Reporter**:

This is your 14th day in self-isolation.
Every time we've asked you about this, you refer to doctor's advice.
Can you tell us exactly what the doctors have told you about whether or not you have to stay in self-isolation after today?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The doctors continue to tell us to stay in self-isolation.
But at the same time, we're asking Canadians to work from home, wherever possible.
We're asking people to stay self-isolated as much as possible and not to go out as much as necessary and I'm happy to continue to do this.




**Interpreter**:

I will continue to follow the advice of doctors who are telling me to continue to stay in isolation.
But the fact is we're made the I can't thinks to work from home wherever possible and not to go out if it's necessary.
and, therefore, not to put other people at risk.
So, I'm happy to do precisely that.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, did you or your officials know that the United States would deport asylum-seekers turned away at Canada's border when you struck the deal with the United States last week?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The work that we've done to ensure that we are staying true to our values and our principles is an extremely important one.
We got assurances consistent with the way that the American border officials have interacted with people who attempt to claim asylum at official points of entry industry and we're keeping consistent with the safe third country law.



**Reporter**:

That doesn't answer My question.
It was a yes or no question.
But I have to move on because you've also announced this massive wage subsidy today.
Can you give us any specifics on what the conditions will be, whether there is a cap, and how many employers -- or which businesses it will apply to.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we said, we're going to roll out more details about this between now and Monday as we finalize it. But it is important to send that message right now.
That if you're a small business who's facing the impossible choice of laying off long-time employees because there's just no money coming in and you don't know how long you'll keep operating, we are there to help you out.
We will send a 75% subsidy so you can keep those employees on the payroll so you can continue to support those families who you worked with, in many cases, years and we can continue to hold together those economic relationships that are going to be so important when we come out of this time of trial for Canadians as we lean on each other and as we self-isolate and almost stop the economy in many ways.
We need to get rolling again as quickly as possible once this is wave passes us through.
Our ability to do that will depend on our ability to be confident in our ability to take care of each other while we're doing it and that is what we're focusing on right now.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Ashley Burke, CBC news.
Prime Minister, there is a lot of uncertainty and unknowns right now.
Canadians are looking to prepare and looking to you for guidance.
Should Canadians prepare for another few months of self-isolation at home?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As I said, the length of time that we have to be self-isolating and going through this freezing of economic activity is very much going to be linked to behaviours and choices that Canadians make right now.
If people are diligent about self-isolating and staying home and not risking contact with others, then we will be in for a much shorter time in isolation than others.
But this is why it is so important and why we are impressing upon Canadians the importance of being responsible in your choices right now, washing your hands often.
Engaging in social distancing, physical distancing, two metres apart from others.
Not going out unless you absolutely have to. As we are supporting people enough to allow them to be able to do that, we know that this will last less long.



**Reporter**:

Agriculture groups and others are urging your government to drop the planned increased carbon tax as of April 1. is that something you're asking?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that it is important that we put more money in the pockets of Canadians at this point when they're stressed.
Our plan on pricing pollution puts more money upfront into people's pockets than they would pay with the new price on pollution.
We'll continue to focus on putting more money in people's pockets to support them across the country.
We know this is an important measure for the future and we'll continue to ensure that we are thinking about the future while we ensure that people can afford to make it through this crisis in the best possible way.



**Reporter**:

So yes or no! on carbon tax.
Will it go up next week?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We continue -- we don't make sure that people have more money in their pockets because that is how we designed the price on pollution.
