At this hour as we do now every day to hear from the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, to talk about what his government is doing to contain the pandemic from a public health perspective and from an economic one.
That decision by the bank of Canada governor Steven pol oz this morning slashing that rate to below expected but to the lowest rate that we've seen since the recession back in 2008-2000.
a significant move by the government there to shore up the fundamentals of the economy and make sure there is enough lending power.
Let me show you a little bit of what the gran of -- governor of the bank of Canada had to say a few moment ago.



Some may suggest that this is using a lot of fire power.
But I think that a firefighter has never been criticized for using too much water.
and I think, if you like, we want to make sure of it. We have great market function and the economy then has a great foundation for growth when activity resumes.



**Rosemary**:

This country, as well as countries around the world, trying to fight COVID-19 on a number of fronts.
As I mentioned the health front, obviously first and foremost concern for many people, but the real economic impact.
and what will expect to happen over the next couple of months.
The governor telling Canadians in many ways we've been hit twice because of the pandemic but also because of the steep drop in oil prices in this country so we're dealing with two crises at the same time.
Let's bring in the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane joins me today.
That rate cut, I don't think we were expecting to see anything from them the last number of weeks.
But they did it because they felt, a, there was more room to do it and, b, because it was necessary.
and it comes as the parliamentary budget officer has given us a bit of a snapshot on what the economy might look like over the next six months.
I should stress that this isn't an outlook, a financial outlook.
It's a scenario that they have come up with based on the kinds of things that they're seeing now.
I'm not sure who wants to weigh in on that first.
Vassy?



**Vassy**:

Sure.
The scenario is not an unsurprising one.
Even they're sort of forecasting based on that scenario and they're very careful to say that the parliamentary budget office, the watchdog here in parliament for budgets that take place that generate from the government.
They're careful to say this is just us making an assumption and then basing our forecast on that assumption.
and the assumption that they make is that these measures stay in place right through the summer.
So, physical ed cal distancing, nonessential businesses closed.
Imagine all of this, the way we live right now, stays in place for a number of more months.
Well, it will have a massively detrimental effect on the economy.
Everybody knows that by this time and the way they look at it is a contraction now, but an even bigger one in the quarter thatle toes a.25% contraction in g. D.p. At that point.
That is huge.
Levels, for example, that we haven't seen since the early 1990s and then, in some cases depending on what it means for the budget, which would be obviously much bigger deficit, numbers that we haven't seen since the 1980s as well.
So, we're in a very -- this is historical.
It is extraordinary.
We've said that over and over again.
It will have an impact on the government's bottom line and it will also have an impact on the economy more largely speaking.
That's clear.
I think it's -- you know, you have to take it with a grain of salt.
It's very difficult to model.
It's very difficult to predict.
I think what we can expect from the Prime Minister today is address ago key search of the economy that we eve been asking about for days and he has said more information, more help is coming in the coming days and that is the small business sector.
Small business owners, I'm told will be the focus of today's announcement.
The message will be keep people on the payroll.
I don't know what specifically that means as far as what they're going to promise.
But for me that particularly raises the question around wage subsidies.
We talked about it often over the past week.
Will they increase the subsidy from 10% to a much higher number like other jurisdictions in europe have done in order to sort of promote the idea that employers should keep employees on the payroll.
That is what I'm looking for today.



**Rosemary**:

and small and medium-sized businesses and we've been hearing a lot from them, saying that that 10% wage subsidy was not going to be enough.
Just to give people an idea of who we're dealing with.
This is really the largest sort of private sector employer in the country.
There are almost one million -- more than one million small and medium-sized businesses in Canada.
More than half of them have fewer than four employees.
So, this is a key part of the economy.
and many businesses are concerned about having to shutter briefly and then just not having the ability to re-open.
David, not sure which part you want to weigh in there, but over to you.



**David**:

There is a bunch of things.
I'll start with the p. B.o. and then bank of Canada if I can.
The p. B.o. Estimate is quite stark and I thought it was a little bit optimistic, even though the numbers are what they are.
25% g. D.p. Contraction in the next quarter.
5% down overall.
15% unemployment rate over the course of the year, assuming the physical distancing and restrictions we have in place last until August and the federal deficit of around $113 billion, up from $26 billion, which was the projection.
That is probably going to grow because there is more spending measures going to come on top of that.
The bank of Canada rate cut is interesting.
It's about as low as it really can go. Money is essentially free right now.
and stephen poloz, the governor of the bank of Canada, said he won't lower it anymore.
This is as low as they're going to go. An interesting part of his announcement today is that they're going to get into quantitative easing, which essentially means they'll start buying government bonds to increase the money supply in the economy and put cash into the big financial institutions so there's lending capacity and they are going to spend $5 billion a week, every week, until we're into recovery.
Just think about that.
That is $5 billion a week with an undetermined end point of bond buying to put money into the financial institutions and into the economy to keep things going and the clip we played from poloz as a firefighter never gets criticized for using too much water.
This is like noah's ark level of water he's pouring into the economy.
and you talk about small and medium-sized businesses.
Most Canadians work for small or medium-sized companies.
These are the backbone, not just of the economy, but your community and neighbourhoods.
Your main streets and small corner stores and communities businesses and we've seen some dire predictions from the canadian association of independent business throughout all of this, without a massive increase in direct government support, one-third of small businesses don't think they'll make it a month.
They might have their rent and their bills for April 1, but they definitely don't have it for May 1. The 10% wage subsidy for three months that was part of the initial response that was announced, that is what they have been targeting.
Other countries like europe where you have 75% to 80% of the wage subsidy, the money goes into the businesses and straight into the employee as a model that they would like to see Canada adopt here.
No idea if they'll go that high or move partway to that.
But there has been acute pressure from a core element of the economy that that is really under acute stress at this point in time.



**Rosemary**:

and small businesses have difficulty surviving in the best of times.
Statistics Canada says most businesses are lucky to get past their fifth year and half of them fail at that point.
Any uncertainty that might come into the economy as we're seeing now would add to those risks.
Just so people are watching there.
You're familiar with the Prime Minister's front door.
That is Rideau cottage.
We're expecting to hear from him in about seven minutes' time or so. Just want to make one note on something that you might have clicked in your ear there a bit from Vassy and David as well and that is this language.
We had been saying social distancing.
We're now actually seeing is physical distancing and we'll try and see that consistently going forward as a be I to better describe what public health officials are asking you to do, which is you can be very social on the phone, on video chat, on social media.
But physically you should be distancing yourself from one another and that is key advice right now.
So, we are trying to be more precise in our language to better reflect that as well.
Peter Armstrong is tracking this news as well.
I'm sure you heard a little bit about what we were saying.
How do you view this move by the bank of Canada today?



**Reporter**:

This is a remarkable thing.
This is part of a coordinated, global effort to prop up and to basically build scaffolding around the global financial infrastructure that so many really early on in the midst of this that credit markets -- basically the short term loaning -- the access to credit that big banks and financial institutions have.
Those credit markets are key to the flow of how capital and how those big institutions work and survive.
and somebody really early on saying having functioned in credit markets isn't going to solve the problem.
It has to be sorted out by science and by doctors.
Once they come up with a solution and they want to get the economy back up and running, you have to have function and credit markets.
Wow it, none of it is going to work.
You won't be able to get the money you need to get the right vaccines and borrow the money that is out there to get the economy back up and running.
That is what's happening here.
But this is an extraordinary thing.
Quantitative easing unto zits a bizarre thing.
It's making money out of thin air into the economy and we're looking at $5 billion a week until the economic recovery is, quote, well under way.
So, the foreseeable future, it is an extraordinary thing.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
and the p. B.o. Today looking at a six-month range of these measures being in place.
We obviously don't really know.
But that seems like a decent estimate.
Let me get you to weigh in on the small and medium-sized businesses here as Vassy and david have done.
There was a fair amount of outcry from them that the 10% wage subsidy was not enough to keep them afloat.
What have you been hearing or what would you think that the government might move towards?



**Reporter**:

There are two things that I hear from small businesses and this is from fairly big businesses that employ hundreds of people all the way down to the local gymnastics gym and rent.
Most medium-sized businesses don't own the properties or store projects that they're operating out of and they're not getting a break on rent and that is outside of their employees.
That's always the biggest expense.
So, getting a break on rent se enormously important.
The other one, I spoke with a clothing importer, self-closed across the country, saying he has to pay all of these duties.
He is paid for product coming in from whatever country.
It's coming here.
He now knows he can't sell it. Even if he does, the people won't be paying their bills right away because they're dealing with this crisis.
He is Ok.with that.
OE still has to pay $130, 000 a month in import duties to the canadian government and he is looking for a leap around that.
and that is a fairly simple thing, but not the kind of thing that jumps out at you when you're trying to find out what is the policy response to a crisis like this.
There's probably not a bunch of people in the room saying wait a second, what do we do about import dutis? it is secondary.
It does matter and it is a matter of surviving or not for a lot of businesses.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Peter Armstrong, working remotely.
We appreciate it. Before the Prime Minister comes out, we'll try to sneak in this one interview.
Heather kennedy's mother is at villa Marconi care home and can't see her right now because it is closed to outside visitors.
I know a lot of you are dealing with that in this country.
Heather was on the local radio show here in Ottawa, Ottawa morning" with Robyn bresnahan earlier.
We were so compelled by that interview that we wanted to talk to you here on the special.
How is your mom doing after two weeks of being isolated in her room and not being able to see you?



**Caller**:

Well, it is wearing on her.
I can see that today I did have a call with her at 10:00 and she looked really tired.
She was exhausted.
and I asked her how she is feeling and she said that she is tired.
and she was tossing and turning last night.
So she probably was [inaudible] last night and sometimes her asthma.
So that seems to be what happens.



**Rosemary**:

She is 92. I know you're standing just outside her window there.
is she aware of everything that is going on and why you are not able to come in?



Yes, she is. I asked her a couple of days ago, do you know what's going on? and she said yes, COVID-19. My mother is a nurse.
So she's familiar with the health care setting and these things that happen.
You know.



**Rosemary**:

What have you been doing to try and lift her spirits other than standing outside the window there and waving hello?



Yeah.
Well, we did go and see her every day and My husband dances around and stuff.
and we got a couple of chuckles out of her.
Yeah.
and we're keeping her up to date on the family.
She sang happy birthday for My daughter the other day.
We had a group chat on the facetime, I guess, the other night to have a birthday party for My daughter from different parts of the country, the family got together.
and she -- she had done a video singing happy birthday to her.



**Rosemary**:

I'm just waiting for the Prime Minister.
But let me end on this.
What do you say to other Canadians? so many people are dealing with this.
They're not able to see their loved ones in long-term care centres because they are vulnerable centres.
What do you say to Canadians?



I would say to be consistent and deal with the staff and the administrator and whoever you can in order to get in touch with your parents and to do it on a daily basis.
We're their lifeline.
They need that contact every day.
I mean, I know that.
I've seen caregivers who haven't been able to make it. We've been in touch with some of them.
They are at a loss not being able to see their parents every day.
and for me this gives me peace of mind and also gives My mom peace of mind to see our faces every day.
Right? we were the continuous fracture in the home every single day and also because I'm her daughter.
But I would [inaudible] distance and try to get that contact with your parents because it does help all around.



**Rosemary**:

Heather, the Prime Minister is coming.
Why don't you say hi to your mom for us. Thank you.
and hang in there.
Appreciate it.



Thank you very much, rosey.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you.
That's heather Kennedy if Ottawa.
Here's the Prime Minister of Canada.
