**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking to Canadians today.
a substantial shift in policy, a big move that a lot of small and medium-sized businesses in this country were asking for.
You might remember last week, the government was promise ago 10% wage subsidy for three months.
Business organisations, small businesses in themselves said that was not adequate.
Today the government agreeing that wasn't enough and bringing it up5%. let's start with you, Vassy.
This is a big change and a recognition that the first attempt of -- the first try out of the gate wasn't enough.
We've seen it a number of times because governments don't tend to work this quickly on policy things.
Sometimes it takes more than one go.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and we heard over and over again, we've been talking about it for days that those organisations that represent people who run small businesses immediately said let's look to other jurisdictions which have substantially upped the wage subsidy and copy what they're doing and that is, in fact what we saw happen today.
As you rightly character it, it is a big jump.
It's going from a 10% wage subsidy to 75%. the Prime Minister also announced a couple of other things that apply to small business owners.
The first being a change in sort of -- or increase in credit, a type of credit available.
So, some sort of special loan and I'm couching My language because I don't know all the details.
They weren't all provided ed here.
But a $40, 000 loan that would be interest-free for a year and there is the possibility, depending on the conditions that $10, 000 of that loan could be forgiven.
So, that is another significant thing that came out of this announcement.
He also, and peter armstrong had flagged importers and the stress that they're feeling.
a lot of small business owners who are importers.
He said that g. S.t. and h. S.t. Tax payments as well as duties could be deferred, I believe, until June.
So he said that acted as, you know, another sort of investment.
a couple of things that I would flag t. Wage subsidy is the biggest part of this announcement.
The original one of 10% had a capper employer of $25, 000 and also had a three-month cap for the length of time it could be used.
We don't have any details yet and the Prime Minister indicated we might not until Monday.
On how exactly this one will work.
He also said qualifying businesses would be able to access this subsidy.
We don't particularly know.
There are different ways that small bids are defined in Canada.
I could be a number of people and could be, according to the tax code.
But I'm keen to find out the granular details here because I think, at the end of the day, that will matter for the small businesses look, at this.
The other part is how much does it cost overall because we're talking about a $700 billion aid package.
The Prime Minister didn't have an answer when asked about.
That I'm told we can expect that from ministers responsible for file later today.
But this will certainly not be cheap.
When you are thinking about that number of 75%. they're the biggest employer in Canada right now and if they're able en masse to access this.
But it's certainly needed.



**Rosemary**:

Let me take no credit for the math I'm about to give you here but full credit to My producer.
He calculated we expected the 10% wage subsidy to be almost $4 billion.
$3.8 billion.
If we take a same criteria, the three months and the same wage cap, which we don't know is accurate, we're closer to $30 billion just basted on that alone.
It is a huge amount of money.
As we see the government writing big policies on the fly as it's dealing with things thrown a it constantly, sometimes you have to wait for the details longer.
But it is critical to the small business owners.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
I'm already getting text and e-mails and tweets asking me does it apply to? and the simple answer right now is we just don't know.
Dr. Ryan with the W.H.O. Said speed over precision is how you need to deal with the virus and taking the same approach in dealing with the economy and quickly getting this out the door to re-assure people and let them know that this level of help is coming and the nitty-gritty details will come a little bit later so that people can broadly make informed decisions on what help will be there.
In a little bit of the way the emergency response benefit, the $2, 000 for individuals, the way that tries to put a floor under families and households, this seems to me is trying to put a floor under neighbourhoods.
When people can go out again and spending again and ending the physical distancing and social embracing they need somewhere to go. You need your restaurants answer your bars and you need those places working and your import-export companies to survive because there is sort of the survival situation we're in of getting through this period of isolation and clamping down on the economy and then there is that recovery period.
and what they saw a decade or so ago in the great recession was that a lot of companies weren't able to come back because there was no bottom for them and it made it impossible to keep their operation.
They lost the workforce and couldn't bring them back.
This is an attempt to keep things as whole and in tact as possible with the details, the finer details t. B.d. Those will be in place by Monday is what the Prime Minister is assuring everyone.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. We're going for some reaction to a small business owner, the owner of fox and Jane's salon in Toronto and she shut down her business due to COVID-19. Kristin, I don't know if you heard there what the Prime Minister said, but the government is willing to give small and medium-sized bids 75% wage six did.
What would that do for you?



**Caller**:

Yeah.
As a small business owner, I think that I can speak for all of us when I say we're keeping our eyes and ears glued to everything that the Prime Minister is saying right now.
For us, I think what he's been saying about the details really is where we're waiting right now.
I'm a salon owner.
We have employees but they work on commissions so we'll still have to see how that applies.
Having access to a loan from the banks, that is interest-free for a year is definitely a good start for sure.
and I think just lucky that we are moving so quickly on this to begin with.



**Rosemary**:

You had to lay off some of your stylists in the salon? is that what you decided to do?



Yeah.
We closed right away, actually.
We were trying to prevent any further contamination or just social distance ourselves before we were even mandated to do it and a lot of salons in Toronto did that.
So we definitely had to give our employees leave of absences.



**Rosemary**:

and the Prime Minister is saying this wage subsidy, let's assume you might qualify, but I take your point there's details to come on Monday.
He says it could be back dated to March 15 and was encouraging small businesses to hire employees back just to make sure that everybody was sort of taken care of. is that something you would do if you are, indeed, eligible?



Yeah.
If we're eligible, it is a great move.
I think it isingsome, again, it's really hard to speak to yes or no with more details and hopefully on Monday the Prime Minister will lay that out in a more clear plan for us. Yeah.
We've been listening and I've been talking to some of My friends that are other salon owners in Toronto and our question is how does that apply to us as, in particular, our industry as salon owners but definitely small businesses in the country for sure.



**Rosemary**:

How have you been dealing with the stress of this? having a business of your own and you obviously have to pay yourself and worry about yourself and employees.
How are you coping?



Well, My dogs are loving it. We're having a great time together.
[laughter]they're tired.
But, you know, I feel for My employees.
My concern is My business, but My employees.
They're amazing.
I love them.
They're My crew.
They're My team.
I see them so much and I miss they will.
It has been two weeks.
Like I said, we shut down right away.
But we talked every single day.
I think we'll have a zoom meeting with each other later on today.
But I'm concerned for them.
They all have rent and car payments and a lot of other payments that other people do and they're not working right now.
They're not making any money so that is a major concern of mine.
I've been a salon owner in the city for over 12 years and, you know, in 2008 when this hit, as a salon, you know, we did Ok. But right now this is a different beast all together because of social distancing.



**Rosemary**:

I hope you do qualify and we'll get you more details as soon as we have them, too.
Good luck.



Thank you so much.



**Rosemary**:

We'll have more coverage on CBC news network and CBC.
Ca. I'm rosemary Barton.



**Rosemary**:

Hello, I'm rosemary Barton.
Welcome to our special from Ottawa.
We're live on CBC news network and streaming around the world on our app and CBC News.
Ca. We're tracking the day's big developments on COVID-19 today.
Much of it to do today with the economy.
The latest move by the bank of Canada, trying to cushion the economic shocks from the pandemic slashing its key lending rate by 50 basis points to a dramatic new low we haven't seen since the recession back in 2008-2009 and just moments ago the Prime Minister announced a a massive boost in emergency relief for small business.
But we have all of those details.
Let me play a kip.
-- clip of the Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Last week, we had announced that we would cover 10% of wages, but it is becoming clear that we need to do more, much more.
So we're bringing that percentage up to 75% for qualifying businesses.
This means that people will continue to be paid , even if their employer has had to slow down or stop its operations because of COVID-19. We are launching the Canada emergency business account.
With this new measure, banks will soon offer $40, 000 loans which will be guaranteed by the government to qualifying businesses.
The loan will be interest-free for the first year and if you meet certain conditions, $10, 000 of it will be forgivable.
Our government will also provide an additional $12.5 billion through export development Canada and the business development bank to help small and medium-sized businesses with their operational cash flow requirements.



**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister making this new announcement today in order to try and shore up small and medium-sized businesses in this country.
It comes after a first attempt to try to help them, promising a 10% wage subsidy.
The Prime Minister recognizing today that that was simply not going to be enough.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos and camp david Cochrane.
We're standing by to bring you the daily press conference from cabinet ministers and public health officials and word of another press conference at around 1:00 p. M. eastern that we'll bring you with the finance Minister, bill morneau.
So I don't know if you were able to hear our interview with the hair salon owner.
Obviously she is hopeful.
She thought it sounded really good, but she has lots of questions.
She is not sure will she qualify and many questions and I don't know how much detail we'll get even today, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

It's unfortunate, but it seems like the indication was they wanted to get this announcement out there and the details would be provided, I think as early as Monday.
The Prime Minister seemed to indicate.
I'm getting messages saying that finance Minister bill morneau might have the answers but I think that those granular details are significant and your guest explained it better than I ever could.
Small businesses are not just a uniformed, homogeneous group.
They have different circumstances in which employees are paid differently.
For example, in her example, it is a commission basis and a lot of retail businesses operate that way.
In which way will this apply to them? I bring up the fact that that original 10% wage subsidy that was part of the first announcement of financial aid from this government had constraints around it for a maximum of three months and maximum of $25, 000 per employer.
Snob singer what way will those constraints be applied this time? will they be loosened? if the same cap is applied, it doesn't last long for an employer and given the projections that we're seeing today from other financial figures like, for example, the parliamentary budget officer that this could last a number of more months even as far as the end of the summer.
It doesn't mean that it will be extend longer because payroll is something you need revenue to meet.
and that is something that we heard lout ed and clear from every small business owner.
If you continue to not be able to access that revenue because everything is shut down, including your business and people are staying inside, it's not like in three months you will all of a sudden be able to meet the payroll.
I'm very keen to find out if the finance Minister does have those details because I do think whether or not you qualify and to what degree is going to be, you know, make the difference for everybody who's very keen for this announcement.



**Rosemary**:

Let me flag to the control room.
I'm not sure you're seeing I. But there is a distorted french signal in My ear.
I think it is radio-Canada bleeding into My ear as we're talking.
It's definitely there.
If we could just -- because I can function in both languages, but I will start to get confused.
Maybe we can take care of that.
David, why don't you go through that bank of Canada rate cut because I think we'll hear more from the finance Minister on how significant that is in terms of, as you said, this is all about -- and think the governor of the bank of Canada said, too, it's all about shoring up parts of economy to get through this and then back out the other side.



**Reporter**:

We're seeing a one-two punch all at once.
There's not much more that they can do on the interest rate side.
They cut their rates by half a percentage point .25% and that is as low as stephen poloz says he is going to bring it. Essentially what is going to happen is the bank, every week until this is over and into recovery, is going to buy $5 billion worth of government bonds to put money into the economy to increase the money supply and make sure that the major banks are going to have enough cash to keep giving people money and keep the liquidity in the economy.
This is a massive move by stephen poloz, saying that essentially a firefighter never gets criticized for never using too much water and this is a deluge that he is putting into the economy and that is backed up now by this significant pivot on the spending side by the government of Canada to boost the wage subsidy from 10% to 75% for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Back date that to March 15. We're asking the qualifications on this and what's going happen there.
What I'm being knolled a live text conversation with a senior government official that on the wage subsidy, it is going to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises as broadly as possible.
We want to make sure that as many companies as possible qualify for this support.
Just like they did with the revised emergency relief benefit that was announced this week that kept broadening it and broadening it and broadening it. So the floor that they put under the canadian economy is as wide as possible.
and to help them with cash flow, the bank of Canada has made normal loans much, much cheaper.
They are going to create the Canada emergency business account that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises to qualify for a $40, 000 loan.
That is interest-free for one year if you meet specific conditions which we don't know yet what those conditions are, the first $10, 000 could be forgiven.
As well, h. S.t., g. S.t. and import payments that were due soon, those are deferred until June.
That is another $30 billion in remittances that companies won't have to make to the government.
That's on top of tax deferrals until december on the income tax side.
That is $85 billion in taxes and remittances that are now allowed to stay with the company.
So it is not a permanent solution but a temporary measure.
It allows them to keep cash and their head above water as they try to flood the economy with more help.



**Rosemary**:

The Canadian federation of independent businesses -- this is the wage subsidy, this is about what they were asking for and on Twitter at any rate, their Twitter has had a positive reaction.
But points out a few things in terms of details that we don't have, asking these questions -- will it include partnerships or unincorporated businesses.
What is the cap for employee, as Vassy mentioned.
I was $25, 000 under the previous version and how long will it last again? the previous version said three months.
We will wait for those details in the days ahead.
It's important to realise the breakneck speed at which we're seeing governments and governments around the world react to these pandemic.
These are things that usually take months and months of planning and calculating and trying to consult and talk to lobbyists and get everybody on side.
Now being done in a matter of days.
Stiefms the first time out of the gate is not the right answer.
As the government recognized both with the emergency benefit and with this wage subsidy and sometimes the details as the deputy Prime Minister has said time and again won't come right away because they are trying to send a signal to Canadians and the economy about what they're attempting to do. I did want to get peter Armstrong in. But I think I have to have him wait if he doesn't mind.
Because the deputy Prime Minister and the co-chair and president of the treasury board are coming in to give their daily update to the government's response to COVID-19 as well as information from the public health agency, new details about cases and how they are treated and I believe it is this deputy public health officer, Dr. Njoo.
Let's listen in live to them now.



Ok.  hello, everyone.
Sorry to be late.




**Interpreter**:

Thank you very much for being with us today.
I apologize for being late and thank you for waiting.
It is a daily reminder to Canadians that we must practice social distancing.
Please stay at home unless you are doing essential work like stocking our grocery shelves or working in health care.
I know that this is really hard.
But this is our country's best defence against this global pandemic.
Please keep it up, everyone.
Eel start by reminding everyone daily that we have to practice physical distancing.
Stay home.
and except unless you have to do a central -- essential task such as stocking up on groceries or if you need health care.
I know that it's difficult.
But this is our best defence against this virus.



We will hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Howard Njoo.




**Interpreter**:

and we'll hear from My dear colleague, the president of the treasury board.



globally over 530, 000 cases of COVID-19 are affecting all countries.
In Canada, there are 4043 cases including 39 deaths.
These are based on up-to-the-minute COVID-19 laboratory testing resultsful but it is important to know that at any point in time, there are many other people under investigation awaiting laboratory tests or not being tested at all.
For this reason, even if we are not hearing of cases in your community, it doesn't mean there are no cases or that there are no exposures waiting to happen.
We have now tested over 165, 000 people in Canada, which is more than 65 ,000 additional people tested since Monday.
On a per capita basis, that is one of highest rates in the world.
In terms of severity of COVID-19 in Canada, the percentage of cases that require hospitalization remains at about 6%. those who are critically ill account for about 2.5% of cases and% of cases have been fatal.
The fatality rate will be higher among high-risk populations, which is why we must do all we can to protect the most vulnerable among us. Another cause of increased mortality is overwhelmed health services that are unable to provide intensive care to a high volume of critical care.
For this reason we must work to flatten the epidemic curve and protect the health care system.
 I would like to remind Canadians of all ages do not underestimate the severity of thises the.
Every canadian must follow the advice of public health and heed the dired warnings from other countries who did not have the chance to start soon enough or fight hard enough.
We all must quickly adhere to physical distancing, comply with self-isolation orders and protect and support those who are most vulnerable.



Do not underestimate the severity of this disease.
Every Canadian must follow the advice of public health and heed the dire warnings from other countries who did not have the chance to start soon enough or fight hard enough.
We must all strictly maintain physical distance and comply with quarantine and self-isolation orders and support those who are most vulnerable.




**Interpreter**:

New Zealand has introduce add concept of staying inside your bubble and knowing what this bubble is. It's a great way to conceptualize this zone of protection that we need to have around us to keep.
The virus out.
French the optimal protection comes when each person has their own separate bubble that is a two-metre circumference around us. But for couples, families and other cohabitation situations that might mean two or four or six people all keeping within a bubble that no one else comes into.
Whatever your situation is, stay in your bubble and please don't step outside of it or burst anyone else's bubble.

Ok. Thank you very much, Dr. Njoo.







**Interpreter**:

Thank you very much, Chrystia.
What's happening right now to the Canadian economy, it's like a plane stuck in a major storm and we're trying to land this plane, keeping passengers safe.
and that is exactly what we did two years ago with the Canada emergency response benefit that helps workers so that we can land this plane and that workers land safely and protect their health.
We're going to give people $2, 000 a month so that they can take care of their health and that of their loved ones and we also want to ensure their economic security so they can put bread on the table.
Today's announcement is the next step.
It is to protect the integrity of the plane itself.
This economic plane is extremely important to PRO pair the rebound that will happen afterwards.
We have to ensure that this plane is protected.
We have to maintain the central engine of the plane.
Namely, small and medium-sized enterprises to ensure the growth of our economy and that is why we're announcing today the canadian emergency business account for businesses.
We want to give them quickly funding to help s. M.e. S in coming weeks and months.
The second measure is just as important as



a 75% wage subsidy for the large majority of companies that want to continue to work and hire employees but they need liquidity.
They need money to keep their employees and keep paying salaries to their workers.
These are major measures so that we can make our planes safe and so that we do take off in a few weeks so that we can do so with a solid economic plane that protects workers and we'll take care of them in the coming weeks and months.



Thank you.
Have.
We're ready to take your questions now.



Three questions from the phone.



Thank you.
Merci.
We'll now take questions from the telephone lines.
Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
S'il vows plait.
Our first question, please go ahead.
Your line is now open.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Ms. Freeland, the discussions that you've had with respect to United States troops at the border, are these over? do you have any assurances from the United States government that this idea has been set aside? answer -- for the Americans? well it's up to them to make announcements with respect to their decisions.
I can tell you that yesterday and today we continue discussions with -- on this topic with our United States allies.
and I believe and hope that they were listening.
Canada's position was absolutely clear and strong.
We explained that, in our opinion, having troops at the borders, at the canadian-american border is not necessary and we explained that, for us, a measure such as this.
-well, we should actually be managing our bilateral relationship.



So, it is really for our American neighbours and Allies to make announcements about their position.
Having said that, we have kind our discussions very energetically yesterday and today.
I was in touch last night and this morning with our ambassador, ambassador hill man to the United States.
Canada has continued to express clearly and forcefully its view that there is no logical reason to militarize our border with the United States.
and we have been very clear also that such an action would damage our relationship.



**Reporter**:

Our second question is for Dr. Njoo.
I would like to know what is the government -- what are you doing to help provinces to accelerate the screening analysis process.
We've seen a large gap between the various provinces.
For example, thousands of people waiting in Ontario.
What are you doing in this respect? also, given what you are seeing right now, do you think that the measures that have been taken to date could help to flattening the curve?



**Interpreter**:

Thank you for your question.
Technically, Dr. Tam and myself have worked closely with our provincial and territorial counterparts and ministers from all of these areas.
This is a key issue and we continue to work on this.
To help provinces with their ability to analyze the samples for COVID-19. To date, we know that capacity is something we can support by bulk purchasing resources such as test tubes and other key material for lab analysis.
But at the same time, we continue to accelerate, evaluating other technologies.
For example, in English, there is port of care and rapid testing.
and that is something we're work on with our colleagues and our national laboratory.
We want to use another new technology and we have to validate it. If we do use a test that is not reliable, it could lead to false positive or false negative results so we do have to do the necessary work to ensure that if we do use other technology for testing.
and we're also continuing to work on another aspect.
We're looking at other technologies.
So we're looking at all means necessary.
We're working close with our counterparts to ensure that Canadians still have access to the necessary testing.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question is from Janice Dickson with the "globe and mail". please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi. My question is for deputy Prime Minister Freeland.
I'm wondering if you can tell me that Canada knew that the United States would deport asylum-seekers turned back at Canada's border when it struck a deal last week.



Thank you for the question, Janice.
That is an issue which we are currently discussing urgently with our American partners.
It is very important to canting DA to abide by our international commitments, very much including when it comes to refugees.
We are aware of the problems of one case and it was and continues to be important for Canada to have assumptions that that would not happen to people returned to the United States.
So this is an issue which we are urgently discussing now.



**Reporter**:

Would Canada consider reversing the policy again if there is evidence that the United States is going to deport those people?



I always think necessaryinging begs are best conducted in private and a I don't like dealing in hypotheticals.
But let me be clear about Canada's position.
Which is it is important for us to abide by our international commitments when it comes to the treatments of refugee answer we are very aligned to concerns.
Thank you.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question.



[inaudible] clearly aligned to those concerns at the time that these agreements were announced.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Next question on the phone, please, before we turn to the room.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question,  t. Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Hello.
I have a question about today's announcement.
I thought that two days ago the benefit that would help workers to keep their linker to employers.
How come we need to announce today this new measure, this 75% subsidy for s. M.e. S? is that because this wasn't being done? perhaps you can answer that question in french and I'll answer in english.



Tau for your question.
and you're exactly right.
We announced the Serb on Wednesday so that we could remain -- keep a link with employers.
We know that keeping a job is important because workers are very anxious right now.
But we also have to look to the question of companies when they want to bring people back to work and to go beyond this so that employers will be able to keep hfp-their ability to keep paying employees wages in coming weeks.
Given the situation that is evolving.
We're offering a 75% wage subsidy and this will allow employees not only to keep their linker but to keep them on payroll.



If I could just add today's announcement by the Prime Minister on the 75% wage subsidy was a very important announcement.
Our government, the Prime Minister understand very much the seriousness of the situation.
We understand, as we heard from Dr. Njoo just now that the health situation is likely to get worse before it gets beer and we understand that the economic impact is serious.
and so we know that the government has a duty to do whatever I takes to allow our economy to weather the storm.
By committing to a 75% wage subsidy, if government is taking a major step to help small businesses get through this in tack and it is taking a major step to do something which is so important for Canadians and that is to keep that connection with their employer.
So important to know that you have a job right now, even if the conditions of physical distancing are making it hard to go to work.
Even if those conditions are making I hard for your company to operate as usual.
We get that and that is why the Prime Minister announced this essential step this morning.
and I worked out that the Prime Minister made clear that these measures will be retroactive to the 15th of March.
and we very much home that companies will take that into account and hang on to their employees and perhaps bring back people they were thinking of laying off.
and it is so important to keep our economy strong.
We acted earlier to be sure that individual Canadian were not penalized for the right thing and staying at home to socially distance because of the coronavirus.
The measures today are about being sure that Canadian small business is not penalized and indeed has the resources that it takes to weather this storm.
and I also do want to say this is a difficult situation.
We can't mince words about that and it is certainly going to get worse before it gets better.
But what the Prime Minister said this morning is a further assurance to Canadians that our government will do whatever it takes to keep Canadians healthy and safe, and to keep our economy in tact during this situation.
and to ensure that economically we're in a position to come roaring back when the health crisis has abated.
Canada has the ability to do that.
We have an exceptional health care system.
We have a very strong federal fiscal position going into this crisis.
and we are going to use that position to be sure that Canadians weather the storm and that we are all goo%backer ined into shape and able to shovel our way out when we are able to be able to leave our houses and get back to work.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

You said two days ago that the CERB would allow companies to not lay them off, but keep paying their employees and that Ottawa would give the money directly to these people who are still employed but without revenue.
Now you're changing course.
is that because the companies refused to do what you asked them to do two days ago to keep their employees on the payroll? how come -- well, we've seen the layoffs from companies in recent days at cirque Du soleil and others.
How come you're offering this now? there is a general context.
We're trying to land this plane and there are some passengers, workers that have to be protected and that is the objective of the CERB that was announced on Wednesday.
We also saw that the plane itself needed protection.
The motor to be protected so we could kick start the economy in a few weeks and that is what we did with today's announcement.
We've given s. M.e. S emergency funding that they'll be able to use.
There will be 40, 000 in loans.
The Minister will give us more details soon.
But the very fabric of s. M.e. S is fundamental to Canada's economic growth and we have to give them funding so that when the economy does recover, s. M.e. S will be protected and that is why this morning's fund that was announced so important.
We're telling entrepreneurs in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada we're there for you.
We are going to support you.
So that we can protect you in coming weeks and so we will be able to count on you once again when the economy will rebound in a few weeks.
Third there is a complementarity between these two benefits.
Employers need employees and vice versa.
and that is why these two measures go nanld hand.
We know that companies have already anouned that their connection to the job would be maintained.
But with this morning's announcement, they will be able to commute to pay these employees.
Companis who are eligible will be able to call their workers back quicker than possible.
Of course they won't lay them off because this connection to their employer will be maintained but able to offer them salaries and they will be able to call them back quickly if conditions allow them to do so. and what's more, companies who would have laid off employees without salary, what we're telling them is a 75% wage subsidy will be paid by the canadian government.
So think quickly.
Know that we'll be there to support you in coming weeks and a 75% wage subsidy covered by the canadian government offers you a possibility not only the keep your connection with your employees but allows you, in coming weeks to continue to be busy and being paid.
Because they're there to protect you, your company.
and we're also there for employees.
Who we need in the short-term and the long-term as well.



I think it is important to see the very strong measures announced by the government is already comet policemen -- complimentary to what we've already done.
The first especially the was about protecting individual workers.
and I was above all about ensuring that there was no economic reasons for people to avoid doing the hard and and necessary action of going to school and caring for people who need to stay home because of coronavirus.
We understood that we were asking Canadians to do something that is not only socially hard but that could have borne a real economic penalty for a lot of people.
So I was important to act really swiftly to put some measures in place so that Canadians knew that doing the right thing on the health front would not hurt them economically and to support all those Canadians doing that.
The strong action the Prime Minister has announced today is veer complimentary to those steps and is all about ensuring that our small businesses, the backbone of our economy, are able to get through this in tack, viable, still connected to their employees and that when this period of social distancing comes to an end, as it inevitably will, that our economy is in a position to come roaring back and that Canadians still have their jobs.
That is what the Prime Minister announced today and it should give Canadians confidence that the government is prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our economy strong.



**Reporter**:

Ministers, Rachel ha ins from CTV.
My first question for Dr. Njoo is about national guidelines for hospitals who are going to be submarinesingering a -- or expecting to experience a lot of critically ill patients coming to hospitals over the next few weeks.
We've seen a lot of deaths across the world and a lot of families, too, are reaching out about critically ill patients who are on vent lays tier and their families are not by their side.
Are there national guidelines send out to hospitals to deal with this reality or will Canadians have to face the fact that they may not be able to be with their loved ones at this time.



Thank you very much for the question.
This is among the many live issues we're dealing with and call an f. T.p., federal-provincial-territorial level.
In terms of My level and public health, the special advisory committee is meeting practically on a daily basis to look at this issue and others.
We recognize that provinces and the provincial officials are each looking at their own individual plans in terms of the health care system, what the needs may be. There is a lot of modeling and projection going on in each of the provinces ander thes and we're sharing that information at the table nationally so we can compare our experiences and what the issues might be that we can exchange best practices.
In terms of a national approach, we recognize that each of the provinces and terms do what's necessary in their jurisdiction.
But we at the federal level are always there to assist and looking at ways in terms of protection in surge capacity and what we can do to help provinces that may not have the same capacity as maybe some of the other ones.
Each of the provinces at the present time is, as you say, a different part of the pandemic curve.
Some provinces are harder hit at the present time and others are maybe not as far along.
But we need to anticipate and plan for the possibility of those provinces as wellful at the end of the day, we are looking at framework and approachs so that, as I said at the end of the day, all Canadians across the country will have access to the health care services that they need.



**Reporter**:

Ok. My question was more about families who would like to be with their loved ones.
If their loved ones are in hospital, how can you visit them and is that a reality now that you're just not going to be able to see your family, but I would also like to follow up on the testing that you said is that you said we have one of highest rates of testing in the world right now.
But there are result backlogs of 10, 11, 12 days that we know of. So, why is it so important that we have your promoting these numbers of tests but not seeing the results.
How is that a good thing that we have all of these tests but no results yet?



To the first question, as we all know physical dis ens hating is the most important measure we have in place right now to prevent further transmission of the virus.
It's very difficult for families who have a loved one that is in the hospital receiving care.
and so I would defer to the hospitals obviously they're putting measures in place.
I think many hospitals have limited or said no. There's no visitor allow.
I think people understand the need to be able to protect other patients and the staff in the hospitals from potential further exposure to the virus and the message we have been giving loud and clear is that everyone should stay home.
You only go out for essential activities such as buying your groceries y. With that principle in mind, people should understand why we don't need visitors in hospitals.
and the results I've been giving you are the testings results.
We know there are a lot of tests that are still in play, as they say, still waiting to be and -- analyzed and of course we can do better and the provinces are stepping up. I'm aware that the province of you are a I don't, Quebec as well.
They're all stepping up in terms of their capacity.
In terms of, how you say, a faster through-put if I can put it that way.
In terms of the faster through-put, the gold standard is still the p. C.r. Test, that is the swab in the sample that get analyzed with the p. C.r. Machine, etc.. and are there other testing modalities that we can use.
Point of care tests that would be able to get results in a much shorter time and be closer to where the care is being delivered.
As was mentioned earlier, these types of tests if they become available, and we expect sooner rather than later willable a godsend in remote and isolated communities and will decrease the testing time.
Right now with the current technology, they have to send a sample to get the test results.
We're looking forward to having that technology available as well.
But that takes a bit of time.
As I mentioned, I think in french earlier, we need to validate those tests because there's nothing worse than having a test out there that doesn't give you what we call a valid, accurate result.
There is nothing worse than being falsely re-assured and not knowing if you have a false positive or false negative test result.
We need to have those tests validated before we roll out those out across the country.
and there's also [inaudible] testing which would be another tool in the tool box.
Not to use too much things like that, anecdotes.
But it being another technology we have in our suite of testing technologies.
So, with all of those things on the go, as I said before, the increase in our testing results, look at how we increased over the past few days.
If you look at countries around the world, by what I understand, we're at number two or three.
I think it is only united arab emirates and south korea that had a higher testing rate per million population than we do. We're about the same as australia right now.



Thank you.
Next question, Julie van dusen, CBC.



**Reporter**:

Hi, this is for ms. Freeland.
Your government brought in the emergency benefit that's going to give people $2, 000 for four months.
So I'm assuming you chose four months because you assume it is going to last four months, the pandemic.
But I'm not sure.
The p. B.o., his report today, he estimates that this will go on for six months, until August.
What timeline is the government planning for that we will live like this?



So, I'll start and I'm actually going to ask Dr. Njoo to offer some comments because that is really a question about public health.
We do know that the public health situation will get worse before it gets better.
and all of us at the provincial level, in hospitals and cities across the country are preparing incredibly energetically for that inevitability.
All Canadians are working really hard to make that worst-case scenario as least of a worst case as possible for Canadians.
and every single person who is physically distancing, every single person who is making the big sacrifice of not visiting a panteder or grandparent in a long-term care facility, every child who is not going to school is contributing to a better health outcome for Canada and a owould love, juli --there is nothing I would love more than to be able to say to you and Canadians on this specific date, it's going to be they can tell us that it will end.
and they can el the UL the things that we can do to get through it with the best health outcomes as Canadians and then our job as a government is to take the necessary economic measures so that those actions we're taking to keep Canadians healthy, safe and alive do not hurt our economy and don't hurt individual Canadians.
So that is what we're doing and I will leave it to Dr. Njoo tr offer a health perspective.
Provinces are looking at a lot of scenarios and our health care scenarios are very much connected with the economic thinking that we are doing.
It's one reason why you're seeing the economic thinking developing, why you are seeing new proposals coming out very regularly because this is an evolving situation.



From the public health perspective, there is a tremendous global collaboration.
We're in regular contact with the world health organisations and our partners such as the c. D.c. and the United States.
We're constantly sharing information, best practices, looking at the experience of what's happened.
, the changing epidemiology, looking at the science and the evidence and using a -- the best merck we have at the present time, which is physical distancing and the reason is we're trying to buy time.
We talk about things like flatten the curve, planking the curve.
It's all to buy time.
Do not overload our health care system.
As scientists around the world, including ours in Canada, are working day and night to try to find that vaccine, that treatment that will help also lessen the burden of illness both here in Canada and around the world.
To answer your question, we're in it for the long haul.
It is not days and weeks.
We're looking at it as well, is there a possibility of a second wave? who knows.
I think Dr. Tam mentioned it. I would agree with her.
We're looking at all possibilities and planning for all potential scenarios.



So briefly, despite the uncertain Ty that we all see on the health side and economic side, we really need to -- and I say we, the federal government as well as all governments, we need to demonstrate to Canadians that we are there to help each other and we're there to provide the hope that we need to go through this crisis.
and they understand that from both a health and economic perspective, we'll be there to support them.
and tomorrow's announcement is exactly that.
We're going to support you, both the workers and the small and medium-sized businesses and everyone else important in the -- in our economic fabric because we all need to go through this together.
So, confidence and feeling that we're all there to support each other are key actions and items that we're again delivering today.



**Reporter**:

Dr. Tam, My second question flows out of what you said.
You repeated often that it will get worse before it gets better.
What do you mean by worse? what does that look like and what is being done to prepare for a surge I'm assuming?



We always prepare for the worst, but hope for the best.
In terms of the worst is that we've already seen the experience in Quebec where they've had a spike in cases.
Part of it in communiquing closely with colleagues in Quebec is the fact that they decentralized their testing.
Before it was all the laboratory results had to be verified at the provincial lab level.
Now there is a network of 10 lab ls so they're actually able to do the testing and have the results come out sooner.
Par of the spike compared to the rest of Canada, their March break was earlier so I think it was at the beginning of March.
and, therefore, we're now seeing as we always know because of the delay in terms of people exposed and now people who have become ill and get their test results, that explains in part the spike of cases in Quebec.
In terms of the worst, as we know, Ontario had their March break a week later.
On Friday the 13th -- March 13th we told Canadians avoid all nonessential travel outside of Canada.
Many people before, even during that time were still going on vacations outside of the country, etc.
We also have the snow birds, etc.
and ma m Canadians around the world and there is increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 in many parts around the world.
With these people now coming back, we're telling people that physical distancing is so important.
But we -- it remains to be seen.
In terms of people being ill with COVID-19 and seeking medical care and getting tested and getting those results.
So that is what we might anticipate as sort of being the worst and then hopefully now with everyone, understanding the absolute critical importance of physical distancing that hopefully in the weeks to come, we'll see the effects of that positive measure.
The other point I'll make at this point because there's been questions out there in terms of mandatory order under the quarantine act that came into effect.
and maybe I'll just want to walk people through that.
I know there's been maybe some confusion in terms of quarantines, self-isolation, what happens to travelers coming back.
So I'd like to unpack that and make it crystal clear to all Canadians.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



That is the next step in making sthaur we don't add to the surge.
The surge might be what happened a few weeks ago and a measure putting in place is to prevent an even further increase in that surge.
If you'd like me to --



**REPORTER**:

Yeah.



With the mandatory order, under the quarantine act, all travelers coming to Canada now are subject to an order of quarantine and that is a serious issue and strong measure that our Minister of health put in place on March 25. So, the easiest way to look at it is you have people two come to Canada who might be ill with symptoms maybe arriving at a land border or maybe even by air, although they could have, should have been checked before they boarded their flight and travelers who have no symptoms and look and feel well.
So, the ones who are ill, that's straightforward.
It's all been in the quarantine act.
If you have an ill traveler at the border, certainly with our quarantine officers, we would take charge of these people and make sure they get the appropriate medical follow-up and isolation and do it in the best interest of their health.
I would remind everyone that it's in everyone's best interest, including the traveler, to declare if you are not feeling well at the border.
I heard stories about people hiding symptoms, etc.. there was an anecdote.
There was an individual, not giving away any medical confidentty, that arrived at the border.
Wasn't feeling wellful was taken into quarantine and a number of several hours later deteriorated rapidly and is now in intensive care in a hospital.
So it was good that that person was honest and told us about their symptoms so that just gives you an example of the seriousness.
Now we're saying that for asymptomatic travelers that come to Canada, get home as fast as you can.
If you are asymptomatic, you're still well.
The direction is go home as quick as you can by the most direct route.
Do not stop for groceries.
Just get home.
If that means onward travel with a domestic flight, we'll [inaudible] and make sure that you get home safely.
Once you're home, you are under quarantine and that means you stay home.
If you have a property with a balcony or backyard, yes, you can go out there.
But that is it. No bike rides or walking around in the neighbourhood, you are under quarantine.
I don't know how much clearer I can make it. But that's it. That's what we're putting in place and I hope Canadians and everyone understands that is the expectation requirement under the order that has been put in place.
Thank you.



I just want to add one thought, Julie, to your question about a surge.
Which is, you know, talking about surges, talking about the reality which is this will get worse before it gets better can make people feel powerless.
If you are at home, physically distansinging in your house, measure your children are home with you, you can feel more powerless and that is not how we should be feeling.
Canadians should be feeling very powerful and Canadian should be feeling powerful because each one of us can make a really significant distribution to our country getting through this and to our country avoiding the kinds of really nightmarish situations that we've seen in countries like Italy and we can make that contribution by doing what Dr. Njoo has described by being rigorous in physical distancing.
That is hard for individual Canadians and it is hard for Canadian companies and that is why what he said is absolutely the case.
Which is the government is here to get us through this.
We will provide whatever economic support is necessary for Canadians to do what I takes to get through this global pandemic.
I want people to be realistic, to do the hard things each individual Canadians need to do. But also to be hopeful, to feel very powerful and to know that we are going to get through this because we are a country that knows how to act collaboratively and that knows how to listen to our experts.



Maybe one last question from the room and one last question from the phone.
Mike, global.



**Reporter**:

Dr. Njoo, when the millions of items came from the P.P.E. Equipment that we were talking about yesterday, when is it actually going to get here? you know, we were supposed to be sent millions of extra things from P.P.E. From china and elsewhere.
is it -- has it shown up or when is it going to show up? there is quite a range of equipment that has been ordered.
We're working day and night obviously with our provincial and territorial colleagues to get the equipment into Canada anja give you an exact time or date.
But rest assured we're looking across the globe and obviously in Canada to ensure that we have the supplies and equipment we need here in Canada.



**Reporter**:

For hospitals running out of P.P.E., what is the situation there and can we guarantee that frontline health care workers are getting the protective equipment they need to do their jobs?



We recognize that all front line workers at ring of exposure due to dealing with sick patients, they need the P.P.E. So I can say that we're working.
Right now I understand there are imminent shortages or issues in the hospital.
One thing I would stress is that as we're working hard to make sure these workers get the P.P.E. That they need, we would remind the general public -- I don't know if it is till the case, but there are a lot of people in the public that wouldn't be, I would say, needing such type of equipment.
Some people might be, to be honest, stealing them or acquiring them in some other fashion that is completely inappropriate.
We need to save our P.P.E. For those who need it. Our frontline health care workers and not for someone to put on their face if they're going to the grocery store to get their groceries.
I can't stress that enough.



Ok. One last question for the phone.
For those who will still on the like and want to stay on for the next press conference by Minister morneau, please do. We'll take one more question on the phone.



Thank you, Merci.
Next question, please go ahead.
[please stand by]-- first, by significantly increasing the number of agents that were, for example, e. I., and there's more than 1, 000employees that were redistributed to this programmefor employment insurance.
and, second, we're going to ensure that employees can work in a safe environment by offering them appropriate measures to offer services bytelephone.
So that people can receive the services that they're entitledto.
and, third, some people who have issues accessing these services, whether they have mobility issues or they have a particulardisability.
These people will be able to have appropriate services offered under specificconditions.
This is offered in both respectful way and a responsibleway.
and, lastly, we'll continue to ensure that requests for e. I. coverage -- requests that we remade after March 15 will move to the new emergency benefit so that people don't have to followup with e. I. these requests will be naturally sent and easily sent to this newcanada emergency benefit that we announced on Wednesday.
So overall we're protecting the health and safety of the servicecanada agents and at the same time with Wednesday'sannouncements, we're offering additional services with thecerb, so that Canada can deliver services and benefits thatcanadians are entitled to. On normal times, during normal times and during crisis as well.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): you're saying that this series of measures will accelerate access to these benefits but you've talked about the thousand cases that were redirected to e. I. but this is the case before you closed service Canada centres.
So are you going to have more people on the phone or somewhere else to help people who could no longer go to service canadacentres to request theseservices? and My other question is --given the banning of people from requesting this CERB if they voluntarily left their job, so if someone has to leave their job because their daycare is closed and they have to take care of their kid or they don'tfeel it safe to go to work, we're telling people to stay athome, what do you tell these people who think they won't be able to request this cerbbecause they voluntarily left their job and they're in thatsituation?



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Answer.
Yes, to both of your questions.
The first for service Canada --because we physically closed service Canada offices --because their agents weren'table to help people in person --we've added additional time and resources to allow them to answer calls and to fulfill online requests.
So most of these requests that are submitted online and they'llhave more time now to process requests because they won't be doing it in person.
Your second question about the standards and the conditions for receiving the CERB, the canadaemergency response benefit, there will be many more details coming in the next several days so we can protect Canadians with this new benefit.
Because Canadians understand that it is a situation that led us to establish this benefit.
We've never seen situations since the second world war and we never had to implement such measure of this scope.
So quÉbecers and Canadians in particular are asking legitimate questions and we will be providing answers and good answers in the coming future.
Thank you.



That ends our press conference for today.
Please stay on the line if you want to participate in the nextconference.



**Rosemary**:

That is our daily update here in the nation'scapital.
We're going to actually stay Ina bit longer with you because the finance Minister, billmorneau and the governor of the bank of Canada are going to come to speak to you in about 10minutes' time.
I want to bring in Vassy anddavid Cochrane.
I want to go into the economic of things on what we could expect and I want to talk about the testing because that's vital for Canadians.
and Dr. Njoo, the deputy public health officer, confirmed today that 165, 000 tests have been done in Canada.
So that's 65, 000 more sincemonday.
and I say this is vital information because every public health expert will tell you that more testing is a good thing.
and he also points out --dr. Njoo points out this is one of the highest rates per million in the world.
and I can tell Canadians that if you compare what we have done to the United States, for instance, because that would be an important measure for us ithink, that we have done --Canada has done 52, 000 mo retests than the United States as of today.
and a reminder that we are1/10th OH the size of the United states.
So the claim that we are doingpretty well per million ontesting is accurate.
and it is important because as we heard from Dr. Njoo and fromthe deputy Prime Minister, things are going to get worseand people need to prepare forthat.
and think about that as they seethese numbers moving forward.
Okay, I'm just actually going toput you two on pause am I'mgoing to go live to quÉbec citybecause the provincial officialsare giving an update.
That's one of the provinces theyhighlighted a spike of casesthere because their spring breakwas earlier than most.
Take a listen.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Yes, hello to everyone.
First I want to give a huge thanks to those who registered yesterday to go volunteer.
QuÉbecers are so generous and it really made the portal blocked, because too many people wanted to be volunteers, and I'm notsurprised.
But the portal is once again in working order and we have 12, 000people who have been matched with orginisations.
So thank you so much to allquÉbecers.
QuÉbecers are generous and we can be proud of that response.
Now I had told you in the course of the past few days that we were expecting to get to this new stage, a more criticalstage, and you will be seeing the results today, we'll be showing that.
So today we have 10 deaths more.
We are now at 18 deaths.
Of course, in the name ofquÉbecers, I wish to offer my most sincere sympathy and condolences to the families and the loved ones.
I know that it's hard.
Myself, when I learned of this morning the 10 deaths in just the one day, it's hard.
and although I had been warned for a few -- I have been warned for a few days now that it would get to that, but we have to continue onward to try to limit as much as possible the number of deaths for the rest.
We have 2, 021 cases that areconfirmed, that is an increase of 392.
141 people are hospitalized, that is an increase of 35. and we have 50 people in intense intensive care, that is an increase of seven.
As far as the number of tests are concerned we have increased the number of tests but we are validating the number of tests that were done in certainregions, so we'll get back to you tomorrow with updatednumbers.
Numbers.
But as you can see we have increased the number of tests since we have more cases, more positive cases.
One word because, of course, when we look at those numbers that we can see that we have more people who are infected than in the other provinces.
The explanation of public heal this to say that our spring break in quÉbec ended up being in the worst of times, right before people being told to stoptravelling.
So we had a lot of people who did travel right before at the last minute.
So that affected our numbers, our results.
I would like to come back to the guidelines as well.
Yesterday I saw on social media, amongst others, that there are many people who said that my call to volunteers was a bitcontradictory.
and I'd like to come back to that and speak about it. First of all, I'm askingquÉbecers, you know, quÉbec is on pause right now.
As much as possible we have to all remain at home.
Except to give or to receive essential services.
So everyone at home except to go get essential services or to render essential services, so, of course, people have to go out to go to the grocery store to get something to eat.
Of course as well we need to have people who give those essential services.
and when we talk, for example, about helping people 70 andover, to help them to go get food for them, well, we needvolunteers.
When we're talking about having food banks in order to give food to those who need it, well, we need volunteers to do that.
So volunteering -- we're not talking here about social volunteering generally speaking.
We're talking about specific volunteering to give and to render essential services such as feeding everybody.
So you stay home unless you need to go get essential services or you are rendering those essential services.
Now, walking -- taking thewalks.
It's nicer now and anyone inquÉbec city, it's nice outside.
It's important to go and to have walk.
You can go walk around, but if you do so, be careful to stay two metres away from otherpeople.
If you are infected with thevirus, if you have symptoms of the virus, do not go out for awalk.
Now there's also the question oftravellers.
People who are coming back.
Who have come back in the past few days.
You are at a much higher risk than the average of quÉbecers of having the virus and, therefore, of transmitting it. So ideally stay at home.
If you absolutely have to go to have a walk -- and I'm talking here about the people who came back from travelling -- well, it's either more important for you to stay two metres away because you're at risk of having and transmitting the virus and, of course, we don't want to give it to anyone else.
Now a guideline that has become very important and I had promised you to tell you all thetruth, all the time, and to warn you -- when we're talking aboutinterregional circulation, when we look at the numbers right now there are two regions that are more affected than the others.
MontrÉal being one of them and the eastern townships, and so that means two things.
It means that the people who are in montrÉal and the people who are in the eastern townships, it's even more important to stay home as much as possible.
It also means that all quÉbecersare come are not in montrÉal Orin the eastern townships, well, don't purposely go to thoseplaces.
Only go if it is absolutely necessary because if we keep the proportion in mind there's a lot more infections in montrÉal an din the eastern townships.
We're not yet at the stage wherewe're going to close down thoseareas.
But don't purposely go tomontrÉal or to the easterntownships.
Now, another question that I was asked of me yesterday and I was able to think about it lastnight.
People who continue working and who are making less than $2, 000per month, I can understand that it can appear to be unfair.
So I asked the Minister of finance to find a way to compensate you.
So give me a little bit of time because it's not that simple to set up, but I'm telling you that those who are continuing to work and who are making less than$2, 000, you will be compensated.
Trust me, the measures are going to be announced as early as we can, but I have asked the minister for finance to set thatup.
Speaking of the financeminister, while you saw that there are measures announced by the federal government, a few minutes or hours ago, forbusinesses, we've also had discussions with the federal government for businesses, for the provincial sales tax and federal sales tax.
So to give them a bit of oxygen and breathing room we have agreed --



**Rosemary**:

That's quÉbecpremier franÇois legault andwe'll leave him for a moment Togo to another press conference.
The highlight from that is thatthere's been 10 deaths in the last day in quÉbec, bringing them to a total of 18 deaths in the province.
I should also tell you that they have the highest number of cases in the country with now more than 2, 000 cases.
An important point though before go to Mr. Morneau to contextualize here -- quÉbec had its spring break before most of the rest of the country.
and that is at least in part why they have seen this spike of cases and the number of deaths.
We know that Ontario's spring break was a couple weeks later.
So that's why we may see a delay in what we are first seeing inquÉbec in other parts of thecountry.
So keep that in mind.
Let's go to the economic measures that was announced earlier today.
This is finance Minister billmorneau.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

It'sa reminder of how this disease is impacting so many people.
Our work to contain this virus just cannot cease.
We're all in this together.
The same is true for our economy and Canadians and canadianbusinesses are experiencing very real economic issues as a result of this outbreak.
I also want to thank the manufacturers and the worker sand the business owners for making sure that Canada is prepared and is well stocked with medical equipment and othernecessities.
and the grocery and the pharmacy workers who are making sure thatcanadians have the food and the medicine that we need.
(voice of translator): I wouldlike to thank all firstlinehealth care workers and I wouldalso like to thank manufacturer, workers and business owners as well as grocery workers and tomake sure that Canadians havethe food and the drugs that theyneed.
tend of translation]as we said from the verybeginning we're prepared to dowhatever it takes to supportcanadians.
That includes supporting thebusinesses that Canadians ownand run.
I know that many business ownershave poured years into buildingbusinesses that supportfamilies, that supportcommunities, across the country.
This morning the prime ministerannounced new measures forbusinesses as part of Canada'scovid-19 economic response planto support businesses and toprotect our strong economy.
I know that many businesses andself-employed people are worriedabout the g. S.t., and the h. S.t. Payments and custom duties thatare coming due.
Effective immediately, anypayments that are due at the endof March, in April, in May, arenow deferred until the end ofjune.
This measure will leavebusinesses with around$30 billion of cash in hand tohelp businesses pay workers, paysuppliers, pay their businesses, rent or mortgages and any otherexpenses anding due.

This measure will allowcompanies to have more money intheir bank accounts so that theycan pay workers, providers, as well as any other outlay.
[end of translation]and reducing the administrativeburdens of businesses at thistime.
This will give canadian businessowners more time to managepressing challenges.

Thank you very much.
Now I'm quite pleased to besitting here with the governorof the bank of Canada stephenpoloz who has a few things to say.
Thank you.



**WELL, THANK YOU, MINISTER. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. (Voice of Translator)**:

Goodafternoon, everybody.
[end of translation]the history of the globalfinancial crisis and itsaftermath, we're well aware thatcentral banks in general havemodest room to manoeuvre.
It's been a thought that thenext economic shock would needto be dealt with mainly byfiscal policy.
This is the case today, not onlybecause interest rates arealready low, but because of thenature of the shock that we face.
and an economy that has beenshut down.
Fiscal policy though has theright tools for this situationand the measures that have beenannounced will buffer canadiansand the economy from the effectsof this shock.
Now monetary policy is playingan important complementary rolein this situation.
We effectively need to stop theclock, allow our medical expertsto combat the virus, and thenrestart the economy afterwards.
Companies and individuals needaccess to credit during thisperiod.
People expect to be able to goout and to use their creditcard, draw on their heloc, andcompanies expect to draw ontheir credit lines.
This all requires that thefinancial system continue tooperate normally.
and that is why the bank hasfocused its efforts on measuresthat ensure that financialmarkets function and creditremains available.
This means buying variousfinancial assets, so marketparticipants can get theliquidity that they need.
Already these actions haveincreased the bank of Canada'sbalance sheet by about$90 billion over the past twoweeks.
We have moved our interest rateto 0.25%. which for technical reasons weconsider to be its lower bound.
We're also launching a paperpurchase programme to help toimprove the functioning of thatmarket which is a key channel --credit for companies.
(voice of translator): todaywe lowered our interest rate to0.25%. which we consider its lowestpossible rate.
We've also begun -- begun apurchasing programme of paper to be able to help short-termfinancial markets.
[end of translation]the government of Canada'ssecurities market isfoundational to our financialsystem.
It's been functioning reasonablywell in the circumstances, butthe level of liquidity has beenwell below normal.
Accordingly, we have announcedtoday that we will begin toacquire the government of canadabonds for our balance sheet.
In our monetary policy toolkitwe call this large-scale assetpurchases.
Helsaps.
But many prefer the termquantatative easing or q. E. our objective at this time is to ensure properly functioningfinancial markets.
and the programme may beadjusted depending on the marketconditions.
However, to reduce the financialmarket uncertainty we're alsocommitting today to continuepurchasing government of canadabonds until the economicrecovery is well underway.
(voice of translator): we areconfident that such low interestrates as low as possible and afully functioning financialsystem will prepare us for thecoming economic crisis once thiscrisis is ended.
[end of translation]to have interest rates as low aspossible and havingwell-functioning markets willlay a foundation for a robusteconomic recovery once thiscrisis has passed.
Thank you.



Thank you, governor, thankyou, all of you for being here.
We're very hopeful to have the opportunity to answer your questions and to give you sense of what it is that we'reannouncing today.



Thank you.
So for today we'll be starting on the phone and we'll take three questions on the phone and come back to the room and then go back to the phone.
Please limit your interventions to a question and a follow-up. Moderator, it's up to you.



Thank you.
Our first question... [speakingfrench]alex balingal with the "torontostar." please go ahead.


---

**Question**:

Hi, thank you for taking My question.
Just looking -- and there's so many measures in the past couple weeks that it's almost hard to keep track now.
You mentioned $95 billion in spending in these three measures for businesses, but can you give us a sense of how that adds to the spending that was in the rescue package that passed onwednesday and where we're at with a total COVID-19 fiscalresponse?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, thank you, and understand that you're saying that these things are movingquickly.
I think that all Canadians know that this challenge is one that we need to react to on aday-by-day basis to make surethat we're having the sort ofimpact on people and that we canrecover in a way that we knowthat is important.
So that's really been why we'vebeen making these announcementson a very regular basis.
What we talked about earlierthis week and the legislationthat was passed represents whenyou look at the direct measuresto people, $52 billion in directmeasures to Canadians.
Primarily delivering money topeople through the canadaemergency response programme, the benefit that will allowpeople to have $2, 000 per monthfor 16 weeks.
So that's the important part.
There's a number of things asyou know.
That on top of that, that we'vehad $55 billion in deferral ofincome taxes for individuals andfor businesses.
So that's how we got to the$107 billion number.
What you're hearing today issomething a little bitdifferent.
You're hearing about anadditional deferral of taxes inthe magnitude of $30 billion, sothat should be added to the$55 billion.
and on top of that credit thatrepresents another $65 billionof credit.
and so that's going to enablethe businesses that go out andtalk to their financialinstitutions to access credit.
and very importantly thatincludes the $40, 000 per smallbusiness loan opportunity, aninterest-free loan, that ifpeople pay that back beforedecember 31, 2022, they willhave up to $10, 000 or 25% ofthat loan forgiven so that's howthat works.
So we appreciate that this ischanging fast.
I can tell you that we willcontinue to remain on top of itto ensure that people aresupported, to make sure thatbusinesses are supported, and to ensure that we have an economythat can come out of thischallenge in a way that willcontinue to provideopportunities for Canadians.

---

**Question**:

and just as afollow-up, you mentioned in yourremarks that the wage subsidywill be for businesses whodecide to keep their staff.
Can you clarify what that means.
Does that mean if a business islaid off that some employeesthrough this wouldn't bereeligible or have to rehire to get wage subsidies? what does that mean exactly?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, I want to be really clear.
We are making sure that we'resupporting Canadians who are impacted by this COVID-19situation.
So that's what we're trying todo.
What we're saying is that thebenefit that we've put forward, which is applicable for anybodywho is sick or quarantined or athome because they need to be athome or, you know, unable towork, that those people will be able to get the benefit, the$2, 000 per month for fourmonths, so long as they wereearning $5, 000 or more in theyear before and so long as theirincomes have gone down tonothing as a result of COVID-19. So that's important for everyoneto know.
There will be businesses thoughthat will be impacted bycovid-19 but who will want tocontinue to paying their staff.
So for those businesses whatwe're saying is that we willprovide them with a wage subsidyso they can continue payingtheir staff directly.
Meaning that the individualwon't be getting the emergencyresponse benefit because they'llbe being paid by their employer.
and we just want to make surethat those employers have anincentive to keep people on ifthey can see that they can dothat.
Which we think that is important.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question, molly thomaswith CTV national news.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi, ministermorneau.
The businesses that I've been talking to today, you know, they keep saying that the 75 wage subsidy is amazing for them andthey're happy about that.
But the Minister kept talking about qualifying businesses.
Can you give us an idea of what businesses need to be qualified for this? and will there be a tap for employees or businesses on how much money they can get?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, thank you.
I think what the prime minister said this morning and it is important for us to recognize --is that we do have to provide more details on this.
We'll be working over the course of the weekend to make sure that those details are available.
We appreciate that it's an urgent and an important issue for so many businesses.
The idea is that this is supporting businesses who really -- they have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, so the revenue has gone downsignificantly.
and they are keeping their employees on, so they'recontinuing to pay their employees so it is difficult fora business to do, obviously, ifthey're significantly impacted.
So that's the broad idea thatwe're trying to address.
and, you know, I -- after the prime Minister's announcement this morning, I had a number of messages from business owners, from small business owners, saying this is something that will help us because we we retrying to keep our employees on and continue to pay them even though we weren't having the same revenue as we had before.
and so this is intended for those businesses.
and it won't be every business.
So they can do that, of course.
There are may be other businesses to the extent theycan't do that.
The good part about our canadaemergency response benefit is that even if an employee says that we're going to furlough an employer or a company decided to furlough their employees, they can maintain that relation with the employee and the employee will get a direct payment from the government.
So either way we're protectingcanadians and recognize that, you know, people need to be able to have confidence that they'llbe able to get access to funds during a challenging time.

---

**Question**:

So no idea right now on a cap?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

we will give you more details in the days to come.

---

**Question**:

Okay.
My second question is, ofcourse, you announced many emergency initiatives forcanadians that will be helpful.
But we haven't heard a lot about the energy sector and you referred to that briefly in yourcomment.
What would you say to people inalberta and Saskatchewan that were struggling long before this crisis that feel they are last on the emergency list?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

They're absolutely not last on the emergency list.
Let me just start by saying that we recognize the impacts for many people working in the energy sector in Alberta or insaskatchewan or Newfoundland andlabrador, are amplified because they have the issue around thecovid-19, which is obviously presenting challenges.
But on top of that they answer Avery difficult situation because of changes at OPEC betweenrussia and Saudi Arabia.
So we know that these are bothimpacts.
What we're trying to make sure that we do for that sector is to support that sector with credit that will be guaranteed by the federal government to a certain extent to allow them to bridge through a difficult time.
These -- especially small andmedium-sized companies.
It's really not different fromthe way that we see how we'lldeal with the small and themedium-sized business sector as we talked about today.
We need to help people to havecredit to get through difficulttimes and to find advantageousterms for that.
By providing guarantees to thebanking sector from the federalgovernment, it enables the banksto continue lending inchallenging situations.
That's what we're trying to do. The details are being worked outas we speak and so there will bemore opportunity to talk aboutthat shortly.
Additionally, we're indiscussions with a number ofairline companies because weknow that that sector has beenparticularly been hard hit andthose discussions also areprogressing in a way that isgetting us to have opportunitiesto announce things in the nottoo distant future.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question -- please goahead.


---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): good afternoon.
Mr. Morneau, in bill 13, provision indicates that the emergency benefit, in fact, doe snot apply to a worker who ha snot stopped working voluntarily.
So I need to have a clearanswer, Mr. Morneau, because we are being asked very specificquestions.
For example, if a nurse decides to leave her job because shedoesn't feel comfortable working, or a cashier working Ina pharmacy decides to voluntarily leave theiremployment, will they also be eligible for the $2, 000 permonth? thank you.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): I know that it's very important to beclear.
There are really two very important conditions.
If someone earned over $5, 000over the past 12 months and if someone is in a situation in which they have no other source of income at this time -- so that means that if the person isill, if the person isquarantined, if that person'semployer is unable to pay them asalary, these are conditions.
There doesn't have to be separation between the employee and the employer.
It means that those who find themselves in a situation in which they're unable to work because of COVID-19 are in situation in which they can receive this benefit.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): all right, well, idon't quite understand.
Let's say a cashier working in pharmacy in which many people who are potentially infected areentering, that person may not continue to work because she fears for her own health andsafety.
If she resigns can she still receive this benefit?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): what I'msaying is that we must assure people that if they cannot work, if they don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, that they can apply for the benefit.
The two important conditions are whether or not they earned$5, 000 over the past 12 month sand if they find themselves in situation where they cannot earn income right now because ofcovid-19.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): okay, so what understand is the answer is yes.
On another subject, Mr. Trudeau said yesterday that you'renegotiating with the major banks to encourage them to review their interest rates which are usually 19%, 20% for creditcards.
What are the banks tellingowtelling you on that subject, Mr.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

To be very clear, I have been negotiating with the banks over the past week and an important thing is to find a way for people to have access to credit in order to improve theirsituation, vis-a-vis theirloans.
Meaning mortgage loans, autoloans.
So I don't have anything to sayon that today.
But our discussions continue.
In order to ensure that everyonecan have an improved situation.
Also I have also discussed withthe banks who assured me that ifsomeone finds themselves indifficulty, that they may miss amonthly credit card payment or acar loan, for example.
So there are programmes alreadywith the banks to do so. and those are already in place.



Thank you.
Coming back to the room.
There you go. Go ahead, please.

---

**Question**:

So I'm just wondering if you think that fewer people are going to apply for the emergency benefit now that you've got that wage subsidy in place? that's My number one question.
and then in terms of talking to the banks, what are you asking them to drop their rates to an dare they listening, will they dosomething? and then I have a question for governor poloz.



a tricky way to get more than two questions in, is that theidea.
Our sense is that for -- for large number of organizations that are facing significant drop in revenue, that they will furlough their employees and those employees will get direct payment from thegovernment.
It will be $2, 000 per month for up to four months.
We do know though that there are many employers out there who notwithstanding they had significant drop in their revenues would like to keep all of their employees on and keep paying their employees in full.
That is a sub-set of employers.
I can't tell you that I know howlarge either sub-set is, but isuspect that there's firms thatwill avail themselves of thatopportunity.
We wanted to make sure that isthere for them and that isimportant, but primarily whatwe're saying to Canadians isthat whether you're in the firstcategory or the second categorythat we have your back during adifficult time and that'scritically important.
With respect to our discussionswith banks, I think that whatwe're trying to say is not thatwe're negotiating on particularrates.
The banks will continue to actin a commercial way that isappropriate.
But what we're trying to makesure is that individuals, thatsmall businesses, have access tocredit and, of course, havingaccess to credit is a way forpeople to lower their overallcosts in their family because ifthey have access to low-costcredit.
The example they would give youis the approach that we've takentoday announced that smallbusinesses can get access to$40, 000 of interest-free debt.
So interest-free loans from thebank.
So it really means for a smallbusiness they can now get that$40, 000, they can make their waythrough a challenging time andif they pay back that amount by the end of the first part of theterm, by december 31, 2022, theywill have up to 25% of theirloan forgiven.
So if it's a $40, 000 loanthey'll have $10, 000 forgiven.
So a very good position for thembecause, of course, we don'twant businesses to be saddledwith debt and this will helpthem to get through a tough time.

---

**Question**:

In terms of the fact that the country may well be in a recession but it'sdifferent than a usual recession because the economy is sound.
is that how you see what is going on on with Canada? and is there any limit to how much money you're willing toprint?



So --



**Rosemary**:

We'll break into our coverage here on CBC news network and CBC News.
Ca with message for people watching inontario because around -- not around -- at 2:00 p. M. eastern, you will get some emergency alerts sent to both your cellphone and your radio, or if you're watching here ontelevision.
It will be an alert that looks very much what you would know to be an amber alert but this will be a special message from theontario government telling travellers that they are required to self-isolate for 14days because of the pandemic.
The message will also tell younot to visit stores, family orfriends.
But you can expect that in 10minutes' time on your cellphoneand radio and on your tv screensif you're watching here.
We wanted to give you a warningthat is coming and that's whatit is, and it is an authorizedmessage from the ontariogovernment that will be sent toeveryone here in the province ofontario.
Let's go back now to our pressconference with the governor ofthe bank of Canada and thefinance Minister.



I start this story though with the Canadian economy, before all of this happened we were about a 40-year low with employment and inflation on target and the economy in very good shape and was demonstrating resilience all last year, despite the trade wars that wereunderway.
So we were feeling pretty confident that actually this year with NAFTA and so on that we would have -- we would have the makings of a very sustained output path.
Well, okay, now we don't havethat.
So since I can't really comment on how behaviour is being affected by all of this, our consumer confidence and businessconfidence, what matters there are the policies buttressing that confidence and this is whatyou're seeing is that those are major fiscal efforts to do that.
In the meantime our part is to maintain the flow of credit so the system is working so that banks can function in their usual way.
Indeed, right now in extraordinary ways, right, banks are doing things like deferrals of mortgages and so on which, you know, it's almost likepolicymaking, isn't it? it's very helpful aspect.
So all of that to say that idon't think that it's relevant.
I mean, how much of a -- how much does -- how much does it contract is how we would measure whether or not we were in arecession.
It's almost irrelevant.
It's just a number.
What matters is what is going on under the surface and if we manage to buffer consumer confidence and businessconfidence, I think that we will, and if the policies that we talk here, if they work asintended, I think that we'llmaintain those linkages between the companies and theiremployees.
and that means that we'll have Avery robust return to where wewere.
We will have limited or possibly avoided permanent damage to theeconomy.
That's what that is all about.
Your other question is aboutq.
E. you posed it in a way that think is intended to be a little bit pejorative perhaps.
So we as we said with q. E. --q. E., the short form for q. E. isyou're printing money.
It's true that the central bank balance sheet is increasing, that's exactly how we do printmoney.
But when we think of -- when we were first doing our economic classes we think of printing money as printing money and giving it to people in an envelope and they spent it. So it's out there permanently.
So the old thing about too much money chasing too few goods, printing money is not sustainable policy.
That's been proven many times inhistory.
What we're doing today is thatwe're doing q. E. in order to accommodate the demands for liquidity by all sorts ofpeople, not just marketparticipants.
Not just by banks, but by companies and individuals.
So companies with, you know, large credit lines at their banks which are there for rainy day are pulling their entire credit line, so they have the cash in hand.
Where does the cash go? they'll put it, you know, theydon't take it out per SE but they know that they have even more ready access to it now they have pulled it down their line.
Well, it's going back into the system but it's being held for precautionary reasons, not in order to go out and to spend it the way that you think of as money printing.
So I'm trying to draw an important distinction here when hope that you appreciate the demand for liquidity rises, as the central bank expands to accommodate it. and someday we won't need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning.
But in order to make sure that the markets understand thatthere's -- this q. E. programmers there to stay, we've said explicitly today that we'llcontinue to buy government ofcanada debt until such time as we have a recovery in the economy well underway.
and we can fuss about those details at a future date.
But the main thing is that essentially when you ask how big can it be -- there's no theoretical limit to this.
and I'm hopeful that it's toobig.
You know, that the -- in fact, the fiscal actions are sufficient you would expect to be a lot of cushioning to what'sgoing on. and that's fine, as I said this morning that no firefighter ever got criticized for using too much water.



Thank you.

**Question**:

For Mr. Morneau, today the wage subsidy plan says that small businesses can access it for three months.
But earlier Dr. Njoo said that this could go on for many month sis what we're looking at. Are you willing to expand thisprogramme at the rate of 75% for as long as this crisiscontinues?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Think what we're pointing out is the reality of the situation that we find ourselves in. We can't -- nobody can really predict -- the depth or the duration of this challenge.
You have seen us respond, would argue, as fast as we canto the challenges that we'refacing to change our approach Ina way that protects Canadians.
What we're talking about today is making sure that protecting businesses that want to take the course of keeping their employees engaged.
I think that we'll be open to responding to the challenges that we face.
So we aren't there yet.
So I don't need to yet come to that conclusion.
But what we've demonstrated is that we do want to address this issue and we absolutely believe that it's important to protectcanadians, to make sure they have money for what they need and to protect businesses Southey can come out of thischallenge.
and if the challenge is longer, or deeper, then we'll respondaccordingly.

---

**Question**:

The wage subsidy came a bit late because other countries had been implementing it and there were calls incanada to have implemented a 75%wage subsidy.
More than a million people have applied for e. I. and there are allot of layoffs.
So are businesses in a tougher situation than what it would have been had this measure been previously announced and could more layoffs been announced if this layoff had come sooner?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

I'llnever be able to know what might have happened "if." what I know is that what we'refocused on from day one.
We have looked at what is the best way that we can get funds to Canadians who are impacted by this really important challenge.
In our situation, in oureconomy, we have about5.7 million people out of the19 million people who work each day and are not employed by anemployer.
So we were very focused on how do we make sure that everybody gets access to funds.
So it meant for the, you know, the person who is a personal support worker who works on their own or somebody who drives an uber, all of these people whoaren't necessarily attached to an employer and we need to figure out how to get money to them and to get money who might be off work, at home sick, and to deal with people who might not be getting income because the employer said that we can'tpay you anymore.
So we realised this is the most important challenge.
You have seen us react quickly.
That to me was the most important issue that we need to get on very rapidly and it's a big challenge.
Because we need to make sure that we can support all of those people and we had to look at our systems to make sure that we candeliver.
I'm now each day we're getting more and more details of exactly when we can deliver.
So people as of the week ofapril 6th, during that week, we'll be able to go online an din a simple way to get access to money through the C.R.A. That we think is reallyimportant.
This provides another channel.
So we're going to keepresponding appropriately and wewon't always get it right.
This is moving so fast that wewon't always get it right but we will keep working at it to makesure that we do get it right andthat we do support people andthat we deal with challengesthat come up tomorrow and theday after and the week afterthat



Do we have another question in the room? okay, we'll go back to thephone, moderator, up to you.



Thank you.
Our next question [speakingfrench]from teresa wright with thecanadian press.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hello, Mr. Morneau.
We have heard evolving spending measures that were announced as of the last couple days.
You say that there's more support coming for differentindustries.
How much spending overall are you considering? and what are all of the -- all of the other measures that are under consideration right now?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, thank you.
I think that the first thing to frame My response to your question is that we start with Avery good fiscal position.
So knowing that that is a really good starting point means that we are fortunate in Canada.
We actually have the capacity to deal with this in a way that we need to. So we have the capacity to deal with this in the way that we need to. I will tell you that we have not put a cap on what we might need to invest to solve this problem, to make sure that we protectcanadians.
It continues to evolve.
So we're going to respondappropriately.
The measures that we have putout so far mean that we are --we are putting out 5% of our overall economy or more.
and that's before we start thinking about the credit thatwe're putting in place for businesses to get through this time period.
So it's very significant and Otis entirely possible that we will need to make -- it will be more significant and we'll deal with those things as we goalong.
As for number measures we continue to look at -- new measures we continue to look at how to support people to get through this time.
As we have new things that we need to introduce, people who are facing challenges, we need to support vulnerable canadianswho might find themselves in particularly difficultsituation.
So we're going to be talking more about those things in the days to come and we'll do it as soon as we have more details forcanadians.

---

**Question**:

I can appreciate that you're saying that there'sno cap, but is there a number that you have in mind in terms of right now what the overall spending that the economy can take right now and what the plan is there?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

No, there's not a cap.
There's a realization that we need to support Canadians andwe'll do whatever it takes to support Canadians.
There's a realization that we need to come out of this strong so we need to support businesses so they can actually bridge thegap.
We're always going to responsibly look at what theseprogrammes cost, but that is not the key issue right now.
We've got literally millions of people who are worried about whether they're going to have the money to support their families in the coming weeks.
That is first priority.
and that's where we're going to continue to place our focus.
Those businesses that are really the place where people get theirjobs, those includingnot-for-profits where people go to work every day, we want themto bridge this gap.
We expect that this will bedifficult.
But relatively short in term.
So we need to find a way tobridge that.
We're not going to put a cap onit, we're going to do whateverit takes to support people.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question, [speakingfrench]from dillon robinson with thewinnipeg free press.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

The premier ofmanitoba has asked for emergency loans for provinces.
and I'm just wondering if you had that request from any of the provinces and if you're planning to do anything like look into that request?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, thank you for thatquestion.
I think that -- that's question that may be well addressed by the governor.
I can say from My perspective that we are in regular contact with the provinces and I'mholding daily calls with many ofthem.
We have a regularly scheduled weekly call.
We know that the challenges are placing pressures on provinces.
We know that we need to work together around the health challenges first and foremost.
and to make sure that they'reresilient also in the face of this issue.
So that's our continuing goal.
and I know that the governor has likely some things to say about the overall markets.
Governor?



Yes, thanks, Minister.
I mean, of course, if there were tensions or stresses, I guess, is a better -- a better word --in the government of canadamarket, there's even bigger stresses in the provincial bondmarket.
This is totally understandable when liquidity is in shortsupply.
and so what we've done is that last week we started a programmeto purchase provincial securities that are at issue.
So we are taking 40% of eachshort-term -- or short-termissue from provinces.
We're working with thetreasurers across the country tocreate predictability along thatfinancing schedule.
and so they don't all come thesame day.
We're organizing ourselves sothere's one or two in eachtrading day and so that'sworking well, it's already hadan impact on some of theindustry.
Spread.
So we know that people havenoticed that we're there.
So this should ease thefinancing constraints for theprovinces and at least give thempredictability for theirnear-term cash flows.
I mean, at this stage we'refocusing on short-term paperprecisely because we all believethis is a short-term shock thatwe're dealing with.
The idea is to get us -- tobuild a bridge to normalcy andalthough, of course, there'suncertainty how long that wouldbe, we are all hoping that it'snot very long.
You know, it's, say, threemonths, four months, that wouldbe welcome if it works out thatway.
and so the financing that we putin place is meant to have thatas a vision, but, of course, asi said in the answer to theprevious question that we canramp up any one of theseprogrammes if need be, if thesituation takes longer orbecomes more severe.

---

**Question**:

and just afollow-up for governor poloz.
I apologise, the proposal is foran emergency credit agency, notloans.
I misspoke.
The basis of that would be thatottawa would likely have acheaper interest rate than someof the provinces.
and I'm just wondering ifpurchasing provincial securitiesis a better option than havingsomething like an emergencycredit agency?



Well, the obvious advantage is that we can do it at the drop of a hat which is what we did.
We announced it -- at the beginning of the week and we did deals this week.
and so there's nothing to set up except a bit of stress in our, frankly, overworked tradingoperations, which is three groups of people scattered Southey don't all become illtogether.
and they're doing a remarkable job of executing as I said that we have accumulated over$90 billion in two weeks already of additional assets on our balance sheet doing programmesthat we have never done before for the most part.
So it's quite a tribute to fastacting.
So, I mean, that I think -- what is happening there is, ofcourse, there's always a modest spread between the government ofcanada and provincial interestrates, but interest rates are all low.
So, I mean, none of this is expensive financing.
Everybody is borrowing very inexpensively at this stage.
So I don't really think that the cost of financing is the issue.
It's the availability, given that markets are demandingliquidity.
and so we're in there to make sure that the market functions in both directions and appears to be that we're off to a goodstart.
I won't declare victory, ofcourse, because we haven't done something for every province yet.
We'll keep doing it until the conditions are normalized, it'sas simple as that.
and, again, the size is whatever market conditions demand.



Thank you.
We'll take one last question.



Thank you.
Merci.
Our last question is frommichelin avlagne.

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): thank you.
Mr. Morneau, I would like to hear your thoughts once again on what all of this means, that this is this morning'sannouncement for smallbusinesses.
What that announcement means for employees who were already laid off and how this is all going towork.
Will they still receive the emergency benefit? or is it now up to their employers to pay them? and do we expect to see such measures for medium-sizedbusinesses too? you talked about big companiesand small companies but whatabout medium-sized businesses?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): thankyou.
For those who now find themselves in a situation without income because ofcovid-19, if something has already been done with theiremployer, they will have the opportunity to receive the emergency benefits.
Which will be there for them.
Should their employer decide to reconsider their options, there are other ways to go aboutthings, meaning that they can --things can happen with theemployer.
But I think that most of the people who find themselves in such a situation now will have an opportunity for emergency benefits for the month of April.
But now employers have a choice and that's an important thing.
We believe that this will make people feel more secure.
and with the emergency benefit, they can continue that relationship with the employer and still collect the emergencybenefit.
Today we have also announced that it will be easier for small and medium-sized businesses toontain credit.
So we -- obtain credit.
So we are there for bigbusinesses.
But what we did at the verybeginning was for small andmedium-sized businesses andthat's parts of this morning'sannouncement.
That is, the possibility of aloan up to $40, 000 for small andmedium-sized businesses andthat's very important becauseit's an interest-free loan andif the small and medium-sizedbusinesses repay the loan beforedecember 31st, 2022, they willreceive -- the loan will beforgiven of up to 25%, so thatcan go up to $10, 000.
That's a very important way forthem to be able to be confidentthat once these challenges havepassed that they can recovertheir business and continueoperations and that's veryimportant for them and it's very important for our economy too.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Thank you.

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): some countries have announced help for small businesses for some time now.
For example, in Denmark.
Here, things are moving, but do you believe that you imperiledor, rather, that you made the situation worse for businesses by delaying this announcement?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): I know that things are changingquickly.
We decided at the beginning that the most important thing to do was to protect people who will find themselves without income.
That's why we created this emergency benefit.
An approach that is going to assure all Canadians that they find themselves in difficulty because of COVID-19, whether they have a relationship with an employer or whether they areself-employed or whether theywork as freelancers or whetherthey are uber drivers, that theywill have access to money thanksto our approach and ourbenefits.
That is very important.
Otherwise, in two weeks, we willfind ourselves in a situation inwhich people don't have enoughmoney for food and medicines andso forth.
So I think that we found a goodapproach, but now we're going toopen up another -- anotherapproach for other companies.
But in the end the importantthing for me was to have anapproach that protects people, that protects businesses, andwith the emergency benefit andthe loans now available forsmall and medium-sizedbusinesses, that we are there.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Thank you.
This ends the press conference.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, that is our third federal press conferencetoday, bringing us up-to-date onthe economic measure this istime that the government istaking to help Canadians dealwith the pandemic.
Both the government and the bankof Canada and the financeminister there bill morneau areanswering questions.
Let's bring in david Cochrane togo through the significantannouncement for people todaythat they need to sort of startwrapping their heads around, theinformation that they'll needaround the small andmedium-sized business wagesubsidy.
David, walk us through that inplain language so that everybodycan understand because this wasa lot there.



**Reporter**:

Who is ready for some math? okay, so here's the new stuff announced today.
I'll start with the wage subsidy for small and medium-sizedbusinesses.
and the measure to deal with thestruggles of the small companieshaving is a 10% wage subsidy to10 months and that's now jackedup to 75% for three months.
and like anything right now thatlength of time is probablynegotiatable, depending how longthis goes.
This will apply to small andmedium-sized businesses andapply to non-profits.
If you need more specificinformation than that, you have to wait and stay tuned, thatwill come on Monday.
My sense, rosie is that we'regoing to announce the big numberand the big broad intention andfield questions about what aboutme and use that to tweak thecriteria to make it apply asbroadly as possible.
If the wage subsidy isn't enoughfor you as a small business, youcan now qualify for a $40, 000loan that would be interest-freefor the next year, and if youpay it all back before decemberof 2022, you get to keep$10, 000.
So 25% off if you pay it backover a set period of time.
This will be run through yourregular financial institutionand the loan will be completelyguaranteed by the government ofcanada.
So that the canadian governmentis using its credit rating andits credit line to extendindividual loans to smallbusinesses to get extra cash tooperate and to manage inventoryand supplies and pay rents andbills on top of payingemployees.
There's a separate series ofcredit programmes for the exportdevelopment Canada and businessdevelopment Canada that can giveloans to I gather largercompanies.
Ones that maybe don't have a fewemployees and may have a fewhundred employees, and they needcredit that goes beyond $40, 000and you can get loans up to$6.5 million that will beback-stopped by these agencies, federal agencies.
and, again, the government ofcanada's credit.
So a broadening of the creditavailable for the small and themedium-sized companies.
Also if your company that owesg.
S.t. and h. S.t. Or has importand export duties that you owethe government, they aredeferring this to the end ofjune.
So payments that were due inmarch, April or may, those arenow being punted down the roadof the so that you can hold onto that money and keep that cashand maybe use it to pay the rentbill until things get back tonormal or whatever you need todo and start paying that back to the government at the end ofjune.
The total value of the measuresoutlined today, rosie, are about$95 billion.
This is on top of what wasannounced and passed inparliament this week --



**Rosemary**:

This week, yes.



**Reporter**:

So announced last week and passed this week andyou're now north of $200 billion in direct payments and extension of credit and deferral of taxes as the economic response from the federal government to the economic challenges posed bycovid-19. That is not an insignificant dollar amount and it is not even close to being the end.
You now have wage subsidies, you have income support for people who do lose their job or lose their income, and you have credit expansion that isavailable.
What is still to come, in addition to any increases or expansion of those measures, are specific tailor made bailout or assistance packages for the acutely affected sectors such as airlines and tourism and the energy sector.
Which is suffering a double whammy of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that is happening right now and hammering the oil-producingprovinces, even before thepandemic flattened the entireeconomy.
So what you have there is thesecond wave of direct financialaid.
On top of that, rosie, it'sstephen poloz.
This is just what bill morneauis doing.
Stephen poloz cut the ratesagain, another half a percentagepoint.
This is where the world isgoing, down to .25% of the mainlending rate and saying that'sabout as low as we're going togo.
and offering news on otherdetails that they're going touse quantitative easing toinject money into the economy tobuy $5 billion of Canada bonds a week -- not just until this isover -- but until the recoveryis taking hold and things getback to normal.
So that's a lot of money goinginto the financial system tokeep it afloat and on top ofthat they're buying provincialbonds.
While the federal government hasan excellent sheet to survivethis, they have more fundamentalchallenges now, especiallyoil-producing ones and theyweren't able to get buyers tobuy their debt and credit andtheir bonds, so the bank of danis going to buy 40% of theshort-term bonds to make surethey have the payments need tomake payroll while this is goingon.



**Rosemary**:

The governor of the bank of Canada said they'rethrowing everything at it and in his evaluation he thinks thatit's enough which I think that is noteworthy.
and then just because we have been getting a lot of questions about it, the issue of credit cards and the credit card interest rates which remain veryhigh.
and I understand that peopleare, you know, maybe using credit cards now to make endsmeet.
The finance Minister is saying that he continues to negotiate with the banks over the past week so he doesn't have anything specific on that point today.



**Reporter**:

We got statement from the bankers' association saying they'd be there to help Canadians and the same assurances from billmorneau and he and Stephen polozand the superintendent of financial institutions had their news conference two Fridays ago saying that the banks would be helpful and cooperative.
There's a lot of anecdotal stories and saying that My bankisn't being so helpful orcooperative.
The federal government to this point is asking the banks tohelp.
If the critical amount of these problems starts stacking up too high that the federal government starts telling the banks what they have to do. Because you can't have every instrument of monetary policy from the bank of Canada and every fiscal instrument from spending capacity from the government of Canada going in one direction.
Many measures are designed to keep the banks with cash and to keep them running and not to have the banks necessarily living up to the spirit and the intent of what canadianexpectations near this unprecedented time.



**Rosemary**:

The goodwill think will evaporate fairly for banks if that doesn't changequickly.
David Cochrane, thank you for your coverage throughout this special and see you on "thenational" tonight.
and My thanks to Vassy kapeloson "power & politics" tonight at5:00 p. M. eastern.
and today there's 10 more deaths overnight in quÉbec.
The quÉbec premier saying that he knows that it's hard, hard to digest that, and the numbers are happening in quÉbec because their spring break, theirtravel, happened about two weeks before elsewhere in the country.
So I'll leave with you thatthought.
and one more -- that the British Columbia health officer, Dr. Bonniehenry, will bring you that information later.
But she says that there's some hopeful signs in britishcolumbia.
We'll leave you on a positive note as we bring you to novascotia where the officials are providing an update on COVID-199cases.
My colleague, there are 17 newcases in that province and iwill sign off from here androsemary barton here.
and jennifer hall will pick upthe coverage here on cbc newsnetwork.
We'll see you tomorrow.



That is inappropriate.
These people need your support and they need your love andcaring.
So I'm imploring everybody that we all need to be at our besthere.
We need to be kind, we need to be considerate and be there and be a friend.
We're three weeks into this and know that people are gettingtired.
I certainly am.
