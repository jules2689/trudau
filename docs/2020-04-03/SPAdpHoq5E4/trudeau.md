**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Taken by the bank of Canada this morning.
Monetary policy is very important, but as the governor of the bank has repeatedly said, the most important thing we can do to help people and the economy in this crisis is for the government to take strong fiscal action.
So, today, I want to speak directly to small businesses and entrepreneurs.
I know that for many of you the past few weeks have been heartbreaking.
You've had to slow down your operations.
In some cases, you even had to close up shop for the foreseeable future.
and because money isn't coming in, you can't afford to keep your employees on the payroll.
These are really tough decisions.
Tough because you don't want to let the people go who help you run your company in your time of need.
Tough because some of you have bill your business over the course of many years, if not decades and now it seems like the this climate of uncertainty could threaten everything you worked for.
I know many Canadians across the country are saddened to see their favourite neighbourhood spots closed.
These are the places that make our communities feel like home.
Or government knows you're really feeling the impacts of this pandemic especially with the end of the month coming up. So here's what we're going to do to take some of that pressure off.
Last week, we had announced that we would cover 10% of wages, but it is becoming clear that we need to do more, much more.
So, we're bringing that percentage up to 75%. for qualifying businesses.
This means that people will continue to be paid, even though their employer has had to slow down or stop their operations because of COVID-19. We're helping companies keep people on the payroll so that workers are supported and the economy is positioned to recover from this.
That is our priority.
We'll have more to say on this very soon.
I with tell you that this subsidy for small and medium-sized businesses will be back dated to Sunday, March 15. For people who have lost their job or are self-employed, the Canada emergency response benefit will still be there to help you.
We also know that for small storefront businesses, they're struggling with cash flow right now.
It's hard to raise money and make money in this climate.
So, to help you bridge to better times, we are launching the Canada emergency business account.
With this in measure, banks will soon offer $40, 000 loans which will be quairn teed d -- guaranteed by the government to qualifying bys.
The loan will be interest-free for the first year and if you meet certain conditions, $10, 000 of it will be forgivable.
Our government will also provide an additional $12.5 billion through export development Canada and the business development bank to help small and medium-sized businesses with their operational cash flow requirements.
This means that businesses will be able to apply for a guaranteed loan when they go for their financial institutions to get help as they weather the impacts of COVID-19. Lastly, we're announcing that we will defer g. S.t. and h. S.t. Payments as well as duties and taxes owed on imports until June.
This is the equivalent of giving $30 billion in interest-free loans to businesses.
So if you're struggling to get by right now and you have a payment due at tend of the quarter, we're going to give you more time.
It will also allow you to keep the money that you would have sent to the government and use it instead for your immediate needs.
With these new measures, our hope is that employers pushed toward laying off people because of COVID-19 will think again.
and for those of you who have already had to layoff workers, we hope you will consider rehiring them, given this payroll support.
Over the coming days, we will announce additional measures to help the most vulnerable.
Youth, marginalized people, people who live in poverty.
We're going to have more news to share with you very soon.




**Interpreter**:

This morning, I want to speak directly to entrepreneurs and small business owners.
I know that in the last few weeks, you have been forced to make very difficult decisions.
Some with not pay their employees.
Others had to shut down shop.
This pandemic has destabilize the global economy and the climate of uncertainty we see now is of great concern to you.
Last week, our government announced a series of measures to help you.
But you told us that you needed more.
and we heard you.
So today we are announcing additional measures to assist you.
Last week, we announced that we would provide a 10% wage subsidy, but it is clear that we must go further.
So the percentage will now go up to 75% for qualifying s. M.e. S. that means that employees will continue to be paid even if the business they work for has slowed down or has had to stop its activities all together because of COVID-19. We are helping employers to keep their employees and support those employees.
and position the economy to recover.
That is our priority.
We will have more details on that very soon.
But for the time being, I want you to know that this subsidy will be retroactive to March 15. For those who have lost their jobs or self-employed, the new Canada emergency benefit will be able there for you.
We also know that small businesses have problems with their cash flow right now.
It's difficult to get financing in the current climate.
So, to help you to come through this tough time, we are creating the Canada emergency business account.
Through this new measure, banks will soon be offering loans of $40, 000 guaranteed by the government to qualifying business.
The loan will be interest-free for the first year.
If you meet certain conditions, the first $10, 000 of that amount will be forgivable.
Our government will also be providing $12.5 billion in additional support to export development Canada and the bank -- the development bank of Canada and to help with their cash flow requirements.
Businesss can apply guaranteed loans through a financial institution in order to be able to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. and finally our government is also announcing that people will have until June to make their paifms of g. S.t. and h. S.t. As well as to pay duties and tax on imports.
That is the equivalent of providing $30 billion in loans interest-free to businesses.
So if you are having trouble making ends meet because of pandemic and you need mosh time, you will now have more time to make those payments.
This will also allow you to keep more money to pay for your daily expenses.
We hope that these measures will encourage employers who may have been forced to lay off their employees to keep them on payroll.
and we also hope that if you have already done that, that you will think about rehiring those employees because of this wage subsidy.
In the coming days, we'll be announcing additional measures to support the most vulnerable Canadians.
Young people, marginalized Canadians, people who live in poverty and we will have news for you on that very soon.
