This is a series of measures announced Wednesday last week and since then, a lot more people are going to be relying on these measures based on the states of emergency and things shutting down.
I'm doing it from memory, but essentially, they're creating two new programmes that more or less provide employment insurance for just about everything, whether you qualify for it or not.
There is the emergency care benefit for people who have to self-isolate or get sick or have to look after a sick family member, or a child because of the school and daycare closures.
That will get you $950 every twoweeks up to 14 or 15 weeks.
Then there is the emergency support benefit.
This is where people like our friend howard come in. This is creating employment insurance-like programme that isfor people who are self-employed, run a small business and can't work, contractors, freelancers or people who lose their job without having enough hours to qualify for employment insurance.
So we don't know the specific dollar amounts on that, but we're told it will be comparableto what you would get if you didqualify for employment insurance.
Those are the two direct income measures that are part of the $82 billion aid package.
On top of that, there is a 10% wage subsidy for small businesses that will run for up to three months to keep as many people employed as possible.
There is $55 billion in tax deferrals which means that no business, big or small, will have to pay their corporate tax until September this year.
That is designed to keep money in bank accounts, cash in the economy and improve the liquidity situation when people are spending and buying less andbusinesses are starved for cash.
There are two other measures.
There is a boost in the g. S.t. Rebate, that low and modest income Canadians qualify.
You could see $300 for low-income individual, but $150 for child or $400 for a couple.
That is going to come in May.
Then there is unspecified boost coming to the Canada child benefit, aimed directly at helping people who have childrenand have extra expenses and needs during this unprecedented time.
When you look the at this, the nearly one million applications, if you look at some the gross domestic product, the g. D.p. Projections, they're predicting for the second quarter in the United States, 24% contraction in g. D.p. That is three times higher than the worst quart over the great recession when we had the financial crisis a little over adecade ago.
This $82 billion package as muchas it will help people like howard in the short-term, the Prime Minister and everyone on down said this is just the firststep, we'll need to do a lot more.



**Rosemary**:

Just to remind people, almost a million people applied last week.
Let me be precise on the number.
On average last year, there was 35, 000 applicants per week.
Services Canada is getting 140 to 150, 000 calls a day.
They are also hiring right now because they realize they need to ramp up their capacity.
and I'll just say in the past 10minutes since we talked to travel agent Howard, I've had a number of tweets and e-mails from people all asking how they do this.
So there may actually be an issue around where you connect if you're registering in a new way for ei. IE someone wants to flip me thatlink, that would be great and I'll send it out on Twitter and people can get themselves organized.
Vassy, that's a good place to bring you in. It's not just people trying to understand what will be available, do they qualify, but there is also lots of issues around capacity here.
There would be no one in government, I don't think that would tell you that their ei system is fabulous and won't be overwhelmed by what we're about to see.



Look, people who are already, last year when you point out on average 30, 000 to 35, 000 people are applying for EU a week, they were already having issues accessing that in a timely way.
The system was already overburdened.
It's a fair question to ask when you see the number explode to a million, that the technical capacity will be tested.
It's also fair to put forward the idea that the federal government right now isn't exactly like all of us, like everybody in this country, operating in a normal way.
There are people from homes, there are VP systems tested.
We don't know the answers, but think they're fair questions to put forward about the federal government's ability to deliver the money because of technical capacity.
I want to touch on something you and David were talking about.
My inbox has been inundated, particularly on Twitter, from self-employed people who are unsure where they fit in the package.
I understand that the governmentput forth they will be able to, but the only mention of them, either the emergency care benefit or the support benefit, is if they had to stay home to take care of someone who is sickor if they had to stay home because they were sick.
I think so far many have the impression if they're just forced to be home because they had to close their business, or they don't have any business, like howard, he has no business, they don't know where they fit in or if they fit in. I think the government has to bemore specific and maybe that will come through the legislation today, but I think it's important that they specifically address that group of small business owners.
I would touch on something that david talked about.
That is something we'll hear from the opposition and what we've heard from groups that represent small businesses owners.
What the government has promisedin tax deferrals is big, but it's still a deferral.
You still owe the money when it comes due.
It helps in the immediate term, it doesn't help in the long-term.
It's welcome, but it's not a magic bullet.
The other thing is the 10% wage subsidy.
That is something for people whorun a business, particularly small businesses, it is not enough to get them going for thenext six months or keep them going if these measures were in place for, say, four months.
That's up to three months they get the subsidy.
There are jurisdictions around the world, the United Kingdom, and denmark, they're subsidizing 75 to 80%. the government has signalled this is the first step and the beginning, but I know that businesses and particularly people who are self-employed arelooking for the next steps already.



**Rosemary**:

Yep, yep, all greatpoints.
Let me just -- because I have a super producer who acts as My second brain, he sent me information around these things.
The emergency care benefit to provide support to workers, including the self-employed, don't qualify for paid sick leave or employment insurance.
If something has happened to youor you have to look after a loved one, that well be available until April 2020.
So you can't apply.
If you're looking online, I don't think there is anything there for you right now.
But stand by, it will be there soon.
Then the other, the emergency support benefit, that may also not be there now.
So if you're looking for something and you fall into these categories the three of ushave been talking about, don't panic because there is nothing there now.
Today is the critical day for getting these things in place and opening up those applications.
There has been a call, I know, from the n. D.p. In particular tojust start taking the applications regardless.
and I don't know whether any of that has happened with service Canada or the C.R.A. But if I get something more precise for people watching and following along on social media, we'll definitely tweet that out so you know what to do once all this stuff starts to happen.
I should tell you that the Prime Minister is, I am told, just about to come out of his house.
You remember yesterday he had that very forceful, you know, stern message really to Canadians that enough was enough, was his language, that people needed to go home and stay home.
He also then recorded a video out of his kitchen.
I'm guessing one of his childrendid that, to reiterate that samemessage to Canadians as we entera critical time for social distancing and self-isolation according to public health experts.
and he got canadian celebrities to reiterate the message last night.
Here's the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily update.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

My apologies for being a little delayed this morning.
It was important I speak with all three opposition leaders because I'm unable to join them this afternoon as the house of commons reconvenes to pass emergency legislation on COVID-19. This legislation will help ensure that Canadians are getting the support they need during these challenging times.
No matter who you are, where youlive, or what you do, COVID-19 is having a real impact on your life.
Small businesses are temporarily closing up shop.
Hotels and restaurants can no longer accept guests.
Some people are not getting paid.
Others are worried about their job.
Whatever your situation may be, our government is here to help.
Passing this bill today means getting you the support you deserve as soon as possible.
When you're trying to help get money out to people, speed is of the essence, especially in an unprecedented situation like this one.
But I want to make it very clear, I believe in our democratic institutions.
All of us in parliament must work together and Canadians need to see us doing just that.
So you have My unwavering commitment.
We will protect and uphold our democratic values.
We will protect and uphold our democratic institutions.
As we deliver support to Canadians as quickly as possible.




**Translator**:

Adopt emergency measures that our government announced.
This is a very important step in order to give Canadians the support that they deserve.
I know that people have a lot of questions about what will follow and as I've been saying from theoutset, all levels of government are working 24-7 to provide you with answers.
Federal assistance announced last week for businesses and workers is on its way.
At the same time we continue to reflect on other ways of helpingcanadians.
What we announced thus far is only the beginning, but the work is continuing.
Since the very outset, science and experts have been guiding our approach and our response to the crisis and science and experts must continue to guide us as we come through the next weeks.
As the situation evolves, we are discovering what more we need todo, what we can do better and we're adjusting.
We will have more information and more support for Canadians in the coming days, but in the meantime, know that the entire civil service is working day and night to help you.
and I want to thank all civil servants, not just at the federal level, but the provincial and territorial and municipal levels as well for all of their hard work.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I know a lot of Canadians abroad are still having trouble to find a flight to bring them home.
I want to give everyone an update.
At least one more flight from morocco has been scheduled.
The first flight from Peru will leave today and we're working on flights to panama, Ukraine, and Ecuador, Eli Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Spain.
On that note, I want to thank the flight attendants, pilots, border agents.
They've been on the front lines of this crisis for weeks, but they continue to show up to work and bring families together.
Just this past week, nearly 1 million Canadians travelled home to Canada.
This would not have been possible without the people who work at our airports, the border and our ports.
So on behalf of all Canadians, thank you.
We see how hard you're working and we deeply appreciate it. Every day someone asks me how long these restrictions will be in place.
The truth is, we don't know yet.
But here's what we do know.
The duration of this crisis will be determined by the choices we make right now.
By decisions we take every single day.
So if you want things to get back to normal, do your part.
Stay home.
and if you have just returned from abroad, go straight home from the airport and do not leave for at least 14 days.
This is not a suggestion.
You cannot pick up groceries or visit our parents or your friends.
You need to go home and stay there.
If people do not follow these guidelines, we will put much more stringent measures in place.
Since the beginning, I have been in constant communication with the first ministers.
We had another call last night and we agreed we have to keep collaborating to ensure that all regions have what they need, including testing equipment and medical supplies.
We discussed the range of challenges being faced and overcome across the country.
We talked about working even more closely together to do more to keep Canadians safe.
We also talked about the emergency measures that have been put in place at the provincial and territorial level.
The federal emergencies act is Alas resort, but as I keep saying, all options are on the table.
If people do not comply with expert advice and government guidelines, we will have to take additional steps.
Right now there are people who are still going to work because they have to. Pharmacists, delivery folks, postal workers, custodial staff, truck drivers and many, many more are keeping the country running.
They deserve our thanks for everything they do. But these people are more than just their job.
They're somebody's mom or grand dad.
Somebody's best friend or favourite colleague.
So, please, for them, stay home.
and do it for the health care workers who we can't afford to lose during the biggest public health crisis our country has ever seen, because here's the hard truth.
If our nurses and doctors have COVID-19, they can't help you.
They won't be able to treat you or your loved ones if you get sick.
This is serious.
The decisions you make have serious consequences.
Not just on your community, but on the entire country, so do your part.
That's how we will keep each other safe.




**Translator**:

I'm happy to take your questions.



Global news.
Prime Minister, you just talked about the need of getting money out the door as quickly as possible.
Critics say this still involves a lot of paperwork, so why not give every tax filer a cheque right now and to that end, last week alone we had nearly a million people -- extra people filing for unemployment insurance, processing times can be slow.
How quickly can they expect their cheques?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize the need to help Canadians directly and quickly.
People are worried about affording their groceries, they're worried about paying their rent, they're worried about how they're going to stay safe and keep their families safe when they don't have revenue coming in. That is why we've put forward measures that will get money out to them quickly.
We recognize that the demand is massive across the country.
and we are working very, very hard to be able to flow money to people very rapidly.
But as I've said, nothing is off the table.
We're looking at a broad range of measures for supporting vulnerable people, for supporting businesses, small businesses specifically, and giving more help to Canadians.
We will continue to work and roll out those measures as we move forward.




**Translator**:

Recognize that people are worried, worried about how they will be able to pay for their food or pay for their rent or how they can support their family in these challenging times, particularly if their income is down or theirpaycheque isn't arriving.
That's why we took measures to get that money out to people quickly, to everyone who needs it, and we understand that it ISS massive challenge for the government to flow so much money out to people, but it has to be done and it has to be done quickly.
and the measures that will be passed this afternoon will help us to help Canadians.



**Reporter**:

We're hearing that some doctors and nurses are waiting more than a week to get test results.
Obviously, that skews the numbers of how big a problem this is and it limits who an infected person came into contact with.
Why didn't your government enhance lab capabilities?



We have been enhancing lab caabilicapabilities.
We know that there are backlogs and challenges, particularly in more remote or overburdened jurisdictions to get those test results back quickly.
We discussed it with the premiers last night actually as well.
We are moving to accelerate the processes because testing is not just about giving people peace of mind, it's an essential element for the public health response that will keep us all safe.
We know that massive testing has been part of the solution in places that have managed to contain or slow the spread of COVID-19. That is why we're investing significantly in increasing bot hour testing capacity and the speed with which we'll be able to respond.




**Translator**:

We recognize that there are challenges at this time when it comes to screening tests and we also know that this is particularly the case in more remote areas or overburdened systems.
It can take longer to get the results out.
and I talked to the premiers about that last evening.
It's also why we're taking measures to accelerate the screening process in order that the results can be received morequickly.
Every single day there are tens of thousands more Canadians being tested, but we have to do more.
Also with respect to getting those results back.
Because testing someone is not just about getting information that will reassure us, or allow us to change our behavior, it's also an essential measure of control of spread of the virus as we've seen in countries around the world.
We want to continue to accelerate those efforts so that we can get more testing done for everyone quickly.



**Reporter**:

CBC news, why would your government think it's a good idea to propose a bill to broadly tax and spend without parliamentary approval until December 2021? many opposition members say theycan't support this overreach.
Why would you bring politics into a pandemic?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize this pandemic is moving extremely quickly and it is a situation that requires extreme flexibility and rapidity of response by governments to be able to help Canadians and reacts to a situation that we'veseen is moving quickly every single day.
So saying we have a parliament that works, we have an opposition that is doing its job of making sure that we're taking the right steps the right way and that's why we've been working on drafting the right legislation up until the last minute.
We've been in close discussion with the opposition parties to find a way to both get that flexibility to be able to get measures out the door, and keep in place our democratic institutions and the values that are so important to us all.
We will always ensure that our system works in a robust way both around accountability and helping Canadians as quickly as is necessary in these exceptional circumstances and that is exactly what we're going to see this afternoon in what I'm sure will be robust, but extremely cooperative and collaborative debate this afternoon in the house.




**Translator**:

We recognize that the situation we find ourselves in now is unprecedented.
We also know that parliament and the opposition parties have a critical role to play in terms of ensuring accountability and being aware of the measures we're putting forward.
and we need to ensure that our democracy works properly, even in extreme situations.
and that is why the discussions we had with the opposition parties continued up until the last minute.
and we made choices to ensure that there could be more recalls of parliament so we have the necessary flexibility.
This is a democratic system that is working and we will continue to defend our democratic values and institutions all the time.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Are the telecom data used to provide surveillance of people at home? is this something that could happen?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, I think we all acknowledge that we're in a situation where people's behavior and choices and the choices we make as a government may be different from what we would do in a situation that is not an emergency.
But as far as I know, we are not taking measures such as the ones you referred to. As I know, everything is on the table, but this is not somethingwe're doing at this point in time and it's not something that we are contemplating for the days to come.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I think we recognize that in an emergency situation we need to take certain steps that wouldn't be taken in non emergency situations.
But as far as I know, that is not a situation we're looking at right now.
But as I said, all options are on the table to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe in these exceptional times.



Good morning, Prime Minister.
Winnipeg free press.
How many premiers asked you to invoke the emergencies act and what is the tipping point to enact it?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We had a good discussion on the federal emergencies act, recognizing that most provinces and territories, if not all, have brought in their own emergencies act to be able to deal with the situation.
The federal emergencies act is really a step above that would involve powers of coordination, of rearranging logistical supply chains to various challenges in parts of the country.
It's not something that the premiers largely thought was necessary at this point.
Most of them indicated that if it became necessary, they would of course support it, but they didn't feel it was there yet.
I impressed upon them the need to further coordinate and provide data on things like how many ventilators they have, so we can make sure they're going to the areas -- maybe not in their province, but next door --that need them the most and ensure a better flow of emergency equipment to the places that need it. But as long as we're doing that in a robust way there is not ye ta need for the emergencies act.
But as we know, things are changing rapidly.
Some premiers were more open to it than others, but all of them indicated an openness to continue the discussions to make sure we're able as individual jurisdictions, but also as a country, to do everything necessary to keep Canadians safe.




**Translator**:

We had a good discussion with the premiers last evening about the emergency measures act.
All the premiers indicated that, of course, if we come to a point where we need to invoke the federal legislation, the emergency measures act, of course, they will support it, but they do not believe we have reached that stage yet.
So we will continue to collaborate and take whatever steps are necessary to respond to the needs of Canadians across the different jurisdictions and we have pledged to continue to work together to have all the necessary tools to protect Canadians.



**Reporter**:

from teresa wright, the canadianpress, please go ahead.
Your line is now open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'm wondering if you can tell me if you're worried about signs that the United States is keen to move away from COVID-19 restrictions in the name of trying to help jump start the economy.
and how such a move would impact the Canada-United States border agreements.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Obviously, the agreement we have with the United States is limiting all nonessential travel, tourism, for recreational purposes.
We recognize the deeply integrated supply chains that go back and forth across the United States and we'll continue to ensure that essential supplies of medication, of industrial equipment, of food, continue to flow.
At the same time, we are continuing in Canada to base our decisions and our recommendations and guidelines to Canadians on science.
We recognize that the need for social distancing, which means keeping two metres apart and not gathering in groups, is going to be in place for many more weeks.
and we will ensure that we are giving the support to Canadians, to small businesses, so as we get through this, we're able to restore the economic activity that keeps us all prosperous when it is safe to do so. Our priority is keeping Canadians alive and healthy.
and that is what we will continue to focus on in Canada.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Next question is from Steve sheer.



**Reporter**:

Hello, Prime Minister.
Today the W.H.O. Said that the United States could become an epicentre for the coronavirus.
You already have border controls in place for nonessential travel, but are you prepared to do more to get tougher on the border? we've heard anecdotally that truckers are just asked if they're healthy or not.
is the government prepared to domore on the border? and what could that be?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

As I've said, we are braced for a broad range of scenarios.
We have put contingency plans for next steps depending on what trajectory the virus takes in Canada, or indeed around the world.
We are looking at a broad range of things.
Nothing is off the table.
But we will respond every step of the way with the necessary actions at a given moment.
At this time we feel that the measures we have taken to restrict flow across the border, to essential travel and essential goods, is the -- sorry, to goods and essential travel is the important thing that we're doing to keep Canadians safe.
Of course, as the situation evolves, we'll be ready to shift our posture with that.



Thank you.
Next question.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

Very specific question.
The civil service is working very hard.
a lot of people are applying forei.
The unions are somewhat concerned.
Can you tell us why did you not send the money directly to businesses and people so that they can get that money right away?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:





**Translator**:

We will be doing both.
We are sending direct aid to workers that qualify for EU or don't qualify.
and we will also be helping businesses to keep people on their payroll and not have to lay them off.
We know that in a situation such as this, there is not a single solution that will work for everyone or for every family, so we need a number of different measures and different ways of getting the necessary help to families and we will do that in a number of different ways.
It's not one or the other.
It's all necessary measures at the same time.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada going back into his home where he is self-isolating now.
On the other part of the screen, you saw the speakers parade to open up this extraordinary day of the house of commons sitting to, indeed, pass the legislationthat is needed in order to get some of these important financial measures out to Canadians as soon as possible.
Let me just go quickly -- okay, I'm just going to go very quickly to the premier of Nova Scotia.
Because he's on the line and I don't want to lose a chance to talk to him before we go in the house of commons.
Nova Scotia declared a state of emergency over the weekend.
Premier mcneil joins me from halifax.
Good to see you.
So I understand there was a conversation between premiers and the Prime Minister about theemergencies act and there doesn't seem to be broad consensus that it is needed right now.
After you declared that state ofemergency, have you seen a shiftin behavior in your province?



There is no question, Nova Scotians are following the advice of the chief medical officer now.
The public gatherings we were seeing last weekend are no longer happening.
There is fines associated with it. My message to the prime minister last night was use every available tool they have to protect Canadians.
The reality is, the vast majority of Canadians, the vast majority of Nova Scotians are responding to the call and the advice of chief medical officers, but those who aren't, we need to use every tool we canto keep the rest of us safe.



**Rosemary**:

What would be the breaking point for premiers, for everybody to say, go ahead and do this, we need that added support?



Well, I don't want to speak for the other premiers.
I'll speak for Nova Scotia.
People need to follow the advice of chief medical officers and gohome.
Self-isolate for 14 days if you've been outside, in our case, outside of our province, no exceptions.
If we're going to prevent the spread of this virus it will require all of us to follow the advice and go home.



**Rosemary**:

What the -- obviously what is happening in Ottawa, critical for people across the country to get these additional financial measures out to Canadians.
How are people in Nova Scotia coping from an economic perspective?



Well, obviously people are very scared.
We're a province and a region that is built on small business, many of whom will not be able to make available unemployment insurance, so we're looking for flexibility.
My message to the prime minister was last night, these are extraordinary times.
We need to make sure first of all we can get the money out quickly.
That we broaden the people that are able to qualify for it. For example, a small business owner, mind you, should be able to qualify for employment insurance and allow companies to basically stack on top of unemployment insurance and keep their employees whole.
Because the reality of it is, in order for our economy to come out of this when we're through it, it will require those businesses to still be there.
I'm afraid if there is not flexibility and funding for companies, many of them will fail.



**Rosemary**:

I appreciate you making time during this busy time.
Take care of yourself and your province.
Let us go inside the house of commons there.
You see Bruce Stanton, one of the deputy speakers.
The speaker of the house of commons is in northern Ontario and didn't travel down.
I should tell you there are limited number of M.P.s in the house.
While normally they would be required to sit in their own seats for the proceedings, obviously, social distancing being demonstrated inside the house, too.
So you will see them further apart than normal.
and of course very few numbers in there at all.
There is also reduced number of staff inside the chamber to try to make sure that everybody is well protected here.
Just before we start to hear from the finance Minister, bill morneau, who will sort of make the argument and explain what this legislation is doing, let me just highlight a couple of things from the Prime Minister there.
First of all, having to clarify after what the opposition calledan overreach by the government yesterday, that he has an unwavering commitment to uphold democratic institutions, meaningthey're going to find ways to make due and make sure that everybody is held to account fortheir decisions.
So some reassurance there from the Prime Minister after a difficult, let's say, 12 hours in terms of getting to this place.
He also confirmed there will be the first flight from peru will leave today with Canadians aboard.
Two more this week.
Other flights scheduled for panama, tunisia, ukraine.
They're working on those.
and finally he said about the employment insurance that I justtweeted out a link for people asking about it. He says the demand is massive.
Nothing is off the table.
and they realize that they need to get things to people quickly.
So what they're going to talk about here today after royal assent tomorrow, then you will start to see more information onthe Canada.
Ca website.
You'll be able to contact service Canada to see if you qualify, because while self-employed people will qualify under one of these measures, if you're a small business owner, I'm not sure where you fit into that.
So we'll get you more information when we have it. But this is a critical moment, both for the government and for the country as the beginning of financial aid starts to get discussed and then finally passed in order to flow to Canadians as quickly as possible.
Okay, here's Pablo rodrigues, he's the government house leader.
Let's listen to him.



To the call of the chair after consultation with the house leaders.



Accordingly, the house will remain suspended at the call of the chair.



**Rosemary**:

So there will be some procedural things happening here as the house returns for this extraordinary moment in ourhistory.
and I'll bring in David and Vassy as I need them.
The people that are in the chamber right now -- so they're not going to get going right away.
The people in the chamber right now are all people within driving distance of Ottawa.
That is who they decided would be here, or if there were cabinet ministers already in town because they remained here to do their work, that is who will also be there as they move forward for about a four-hour session, which we won't bring you all of, because that would be a lot [laughter]. but we'll bring you key moments in the finance Minister, opposition leader and what have you.
Maybe we can circle back.
I wanted to get the premier in. Don't like to keep premiers waiting, but circle back to the things the Prime Minister had to say.



**Vassy**:

a couple of things that jumped out for me, the first is on the political undertone to what is happening today, you have already summarized for our viewers what happened overnight, how essentially the opposition accused the government of tacking on this measure that would have given it unilateral power to change taxes or to change spending for a long time.
Until the end of 2021.
They backed down off of that.
It appears that opposition, so far from tweets and I'm saying Pierre poilievre and Andrew Scheer, they haven't backed downenough.
They say there is other stuff.
That is something for the viewers to watch as we see this unfold in parliament today.
How does the debate, which we'reanticipating to be four hours, how does it go? are they able to -- it seems they'll be able to reach agreement on the broad strokes of the bill and particularly where the financial aid is concerned, about how does this factor into it. He was asked by Olivia stefanovich and he didn't provide a specific answer.
He said there was a need to respond to a fluid situation.
Perhaps that why they felt they needed that power, but in talking to opposition parties, he tried to provide reassurance, should parliamentary oversight be necessary, everybody can perform that function, but I don't feel that he spoke to the strategy behind including it. and particularly, she asked why did you bring politics into the pandemic which is again something David highlighted and he didn't provide an answer on that as well.
That is one thing that will continue to dog the government today during the discussion.
He talked about a bunch of otherstuff.
You brought it up with the premier of Nova Scotia, the emergencies act.
From My information, the premier of quÉbec is opposed to that happening right now.
The Prime Minister said basically it didn't seem broadly in the discussion like the premiers were asking for it to happen, Blaine Higgs the premier of New Brunswick is the only one to publicly that is something that is necessary.
But it seems they're still a distance away from enacting anything like that.



**Rosemary**:

As we've been talking, just sent a couple of texts.
It seems that the house has suspended, Pablo rodrigues, the house leader ask the house be suspended until later today.
I'm told by a couple of people it's because they're still negotiating on the legislation itself.
So this is a little more complicated than we thought it would be. a little more complicated than it even needs to be probably, but this is the opposition doing their work to make sure they ask the right questions and everybody gets the right piece of legislation that they can support.
a reminder, the first draft piece of legislation that peoplereceived, including opposition parties, was going to allow the government to put in different taxation measures and spending measures all until December 2021.
There was a period of negotiation last night.
Finally the Prime Minister concluding that and the house leader saying that would be removed, but now, and maybe it'ssome of those things you were talking about there, Vassy, some of the things that Pierre poilievre, who is self-isolatingright now as he awaits a COVID-19 test, is highlighting maybe someof those things that are of concern and so negotiations continue I guess between house leaders and critics about what this is actually go to look like.
I'll maybe let you do a little texting, too.
I'll go to david.



**Vassy**:

Yeah [laughter].



**Rosemary**:

Obviously, the house is suspending and we have to come back later and we'll hand over coverage, but that seems to be what is at play.



**Reporter**:

I have information.
Opposition M.P. who was in a position to know, say they're suspended until 1:50 eastern.
So nearly 2:00 eastern time.
So the house is on break for another hour and 40 minutes as they sort out this unpopular piece of legislation, or a pieceof legislation with unpopular segments.
and now that back-and-forth is happening.
What looked like a unity parliament, reduced parliament, is now business as usual in unusual times as they haggle on what they're going to vote on approve today.
That is the latest we have from the opposition M.P. we all expected this to get go, wham, bam, it would be done, butnothing goes as planned in the middle of COVID-19. They're still negotiating and the way the motion -- the way the motion will work and as soonas they pass -- okay.
They're still negotiating.
They're going it figure out -- so if we start, they're done.
and there is no way this motion is going to pass the way it is currently done.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
and that, of course, follows the prime Minister having to come out and say off the top of his briefing today, that he believes in our democratic institutions, he has unwavering commitment to uphold them and wants to work with the opposition parties to get this done.
I don't think anyone should question that it will get done.
There seems to be at least on the a-package itself, enormous amount of good will.
In some of the details in terms of how far the government can go. and the opposition, you know, when the house is not sitting, it's difficult to perform your duty as an opposition party, butthese are the moments when they do have to step up and make sure, particularly in a minorityparliament, that they're asking the right questions and getting the right kind of answers.
I don't know if you have more information, Vassy?



**Vassy**:

Yeah, you're right.
They are still negotiating and it could -- I'm hearing from two people in the government that could last a few hours.
That they don't know exactly from the government's perspective, at least, how long that is going to last.
They're providing for as much time as possible so they don't mess up any other time line set for the afternoon, which we know are important time lines, especially taking a step outside of Ottawa and parliament for people awaiting news on the financial help.
But they seem to think that given what negotiations are taking place right now, they'll still be able to complete what they needed to complete today, but we might be looking at a delay of a few hours.



**Reporter**:

If I can, one of the things I'm told, one of the concerns from the opposition parties, once this is tabled andpassed, there is no way to come back and amend it, just the way parliament is working.
No amending process.
So this is one of the things they're trying to sort out in the negotiations.
What I'm told, once you see the house of commons come back from the suspension by the chair right now, it means the negotiations are over and this is going to be done because it will only come back if there is that cross-party support to get this done.



**Rosemary**:

That's an importantpoint.
This is not a situation where there will be enormous amount of times of adding amendments and studying it. They want this to happen today and royal assent by 3:00 tomorrow.
I think everyone agrees, the measures are important.
You heard it from the Prime Minister.
Civil servants working full out to put the systems in place to make sure that will happen as well.
a slight change of plans and a slight delay in terms of how this unfolds.
The government and the opposition parties now taking a short break as Vassy says, a few hours potentially, to try to sort out the final details of the legislation.
They will come back later.
We will hear from the finance Minister and we will get explanations around what this final version will look like.
Let's hope that it gets done today because know and -- I know and have received so many e-mails from so many of you waiting for this to behalf.
We're waiting for an update fromcanada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, who will do it on her own, because the cabinet that usually is with her, has moved to the negotiations.
As we try to figure out what is happening next, let's go to our friend Dr. Peter lin.
I'll take a pause from the parliamentary stuff.
The parliamentary decisions and things that are going on. Which are very important obviously for Canadians.
Just to talk about things from ahealth perspective.
I noticed that the W.H.O. and I believe the Prime Minister was asked about it today, is now signalling that the United States will soon or is already the epicentre of this disease.
and the governor of new York, governor Como is saying the number of tests are doubling at a rapid pace.
How concerning is it to you that our neighbour to the south, okay, we've restricted entry at the border, you know, but still, our neighbour to the south is now becoming a case of a real problem of containment of these cases.



Yeah, so basically, they have obviously community spread which means they cannot track the people.
Which now means their social distancing is so important.
I think the key thing to remember, their numbers are jumping up 5, 000 per day.
Our numbers here are jumping up in terms of hundred, 200.
There is a good chance we can still contain it because we have returning travellers, we tackled them well and make sure they're isolated away from other folks and we keep the cases small.
There will be increasing cases of the days to come in Canada, but hopefully once we get over the travel we won't be importing the cases and hopefully we don'ttransmit.
One of the things I want to point out.
When is this going to be over? how many more billions do we need to pour in? in order to have things lifted, we need zero new cases for at least three weeks before we can say we're over the incubation period.
Imagine we're in the 200 ballpark initially.
It jumped yesterday because we changed the testing.
There are more tests coming through, getting through the backlog.
But if we get that number back toward the zero, that's when we can start thinking about lifting these sanctions or whatever you want to call these things that have been limiting.
But so far in the world, nobody has reached a zero.
So china hasn't reached zero, south Korea hasn't reached zero.
That is why the social distancing is so important and not transmitting it within your family is so important, because as soon as we hit zero, that means we're in the clear period.
United states is not going to hit zero any time soon because their numbers are increasing.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to let you go, because the top doctor here is also talking.
We'll come back to you as needed.
Dr. Theresa tam, Canada's chief public health officer.



We have to avoid coming into contact with many surfaces that have the virus, doorknobs, counters, handrails.
This is why for high-risk people, it is safest to stay inside the home as much as possible.
If you need to venture out for fresh air, keep our hands away from your face and practise hand-washing for 20 seconds as soon as you're back home.
Canadians of all ages are joining in this public health effort.
In New Brunswick, a kid colouredwords of encouragement in crayonthese words posted in the windowfor all to see.
It says we all have to do hard things.
So I am your ear worm, your broken record, it's important toreinforce these recommendations.
So play it forward.
Canadians are used to doing hardthings.
Let's not tire or give up too soon.
We need to get this done.
Let's plank that curve.
Thank you.

In Canada, as of this moment, there are 2176 cases of COVID-19 and 25 deaths.
This morning, 220 repatriated passengers from the grand princess who are symptom-free atthe end of their 14-day quarantine period were released from c. F.b. Trenton.
Other passengers who tested positive for the virus will remain at c. F.b. Trenton until their new release date.
Along with their asymptomatic contacts whose quarantine periodwas reset.
Over 120 people in Canada have been tested so far which represents an average of 10, 000 people tested per day.
According to available information, there is an almost equal mix of travellers who are exposed to the virus outside of Canada and their close contacts and as cases who were exposed ina community setting IN Canada.
To reduce the travel-related cases, travellers coming into Canada must self-isolate in their homes for 14 days even if they are not showing any symptoms.
As long as you remain asymptomatic, it's okay to go outside for a walk while keepingat least two metres away from others.
It is very important to rememberto follow the instructions of the local health authorities.
For the rest of the population, we must all create two-metre zone of protection around ourselves and to protect vulnerable groups by practising social distancing.
Two metres is the distance that infected droplets can spread from a cough or sneeze.
We must also a avoid coming intocontact with the many surfaces that can be contaminated with the virus, like doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails, counters, et cetera.
That is why it is safest for high-risk people to stay inside their home as much as possible.
If you need to go outside for fresh air, practise meticulous hand-washing for 20 seconds, as soon as you are back home.
Canadians of all ages are joining in this public health effort and are doing it in caring ways.
It shows us how deep our humanity runs.
In New Brunswick, one small handcoloured in showed encouraging words saying we all have to do hard things.
This was in the window so that social distancing walkers could see it. Canadians are used to doing hardthings.
We must not waiver or give up too soon.
Thank you.



We'll start with questions in the room and then go to the phone.
