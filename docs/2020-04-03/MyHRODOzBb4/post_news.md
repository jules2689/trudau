This is the regular briefing we get from the cabinet committee and the chief public health officer.
Today, cabinet ministers busy trying to get this critical piece of legislation passed.
So I want to wrap up here on the main network with My colleagues Vassy and David before we go back to Dr. Tam and bring you all the information you need there.
Vassy, a strange turn of events here to say the least.



**Vassy**:

Very strange.
What we had anticipated was that these 30 or so members of parliament would be in there at this moment debating four hours for the legislation they need to enacts for the financial aid package that the government first proposed last week to come into effect so Canadians can access that money.
What ended up happening as we were watching, all of a sudden, Pablo rodrigues, the house leader stood up and suspended things.
We're told that is because they're still negotiating over the various aspects of the bill.
and specifically, I would drill down to the fact that that negotiation could take up to a couple of hours.
I think that number is very fluid and could definitely change.
But also on the whole issue that came into play last night on the liberals inserting into the legislation not just things to do with the financial aid package, but unilateral power to tax and spend that was then removed, but there are other parts of the bill, as it currently stands, that the conservatives say gives the liberals too much power.
That is a bit about what the negotiations are right now.
We're expecting them to take maybe up to a few hours at which point the house would resume and we would see debated or the progression of the bill.



**Rosemary**:

There is various meetings and calls happening right now as we're trying to get to a place where everybody agrees on things.
I would say when the Prime Minister was asked about why they did this, the answer was that they require extreme rapidity in order to react to this and lots of flexibility.
So I take that point.
I think it's an important one, David, as the government looks for the fastest way to get help out to people, but there is a accountability aspect.
The government does have to have certain check and balances on handing out a huge amount of money.

There is another developing situation I'm trying to understand.
Scott Reid, eastern Ontario, he is not supposed to be part of the 32 M.P.s in the house of commons.
He has tweeted and posted, he will be in parliament over the objections and advice of his party leadership and his party whip because he is extremely uncomfortable with the measures in this legislation and says he's uncomfortable in the authorities that the government was given when the house suspended on February 13th.
and he is going to the house of commons, he says, with the intention of denying unanimous consent which is what all of these negotiations hinge on to allow for the speedy passage of the aid package, unless there are limiters put in place on what the government can do. So he's not only uncomfortable with what is in the draft legislation, but he's uncomfortable retroactively withthe spending authorities that his own party leadership agreed to when the house of commons wassuspended on Friday the 13th until April 20th for the government to operate and respond to the pandemic.
This is something none of us sawcoming, but scott reid has defied all the political and medical advice to stay awith way -- away, but he says he's not going to let this pass.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for your coverage here.
Just to bring you up to speed on what seems very procedural in the house of commons right now.
Something you don't normally watch very closely, but the reason it's important, of course, is that the government and opposition parties are trying to get together to collectively and very quickly pass an $82 billion stimulus package.
An aid package to you at this moment of the pandemic.
$27 billion which is directly money coming to you.
The rest is tax deferrals.
There was a hope that could be done by the end of day tomorrow, but now both sides are negotiating around concerns.
It would seem the conservatives have ongoing concerns around how much power the government has been given this piece of legislation.
The house suspended for now, bu twill be back later this afternoon.
We'll bring that to you live.
As we
