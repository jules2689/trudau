World and CBC and CBC network.
Ottawa is the focus here for the next several hours.
We are, as we've gotten used to, waiting for the Prime Minister to address the nation today, expected around 11:30 a. M. eastern today as well as a critical moment inside an extraordinary moment inside parliament, where 32 M.P.s, justa handful, will soon vote.
The debate and the questions will start at noon on $82 billion aid package that is meant to help you, help Canadians, try to get through this pandemic.
We've heard today from the opposition leader, Andrew Scheer.
He is amongst the 11 M.P.s in ottawa today to vote on the COVID-19 relief package.
Scheer was asked about the initial draft that would have given taxation and spending powers up until the end of 2021.



The biggest concern was that we've been having a conversation for the past few days about providing assistance to Canadians, helping those people with shifts cancelled, been laidoff.
Almost a million Canadians laid off as of this morning.
We want to help those people.
We're here to help pass the measures announced, to help people get through the next few days or weeks.
What was not proposed was any kind of unlimited spending power, any elimination of the role of parliamentary oversight for months and months ahead.
We believe that parliament can function, our institutions can function, our parliamentary system has seen this country through two world wars, through other public health crises and we're prepared to cooperate, be flexible.
We're going to agree to pass this package of assistance very quickly.
So I believe that parliament can continue to play its role, provide transparency and oversight it was designed to do.



That is Andrew Scheer.
Let me bring in Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
This all unfolded over the course of a number of hours last evening when a draft version of the legislation was leaked.
and the conservatives immediately started talking about how concerned they were that there was this provision to give the government the ability to get money out the door, but also to change taxation for another more than 20 months.
It was obviously a problem for them.
and as the public pressure started to build, we saw the government move quickly back on that first proposal, I guess is how they're characterizing it. Get you both to weigh in.



**Vassy**:

They climbed down quickly.
It took a few hours of pressure from the opposition and outcries on social media immediately.
I think what was so surprising and rosy, you have your hands on the bill, if you look through it, most was exactly what they said.
It's all to do with this massive aid package that is really important for parliament to enact so people can get the money they need in order to cope with the spread of the virus and economic impact of it. Sandwiched in there was a section on unilateral spending power.
Which means they don't need parliament to approve.
This liberal government can do whatever they want when it comes to taxation for a really long time.
There might be an argument for finite amount of time given the situation, but anything beyond that raised eyebrows.
We saw Pablo Rodriguez that's the liberal house leader, saying they were going to climb down.
and the Prime Minister tweeted out that part of the bill would no longer be a part of it. I'm interested to hear how the Prime Minister defends it. I don't know if either of you had any more luck than me, but cannot get a straight answer from anyone what they were thinking and why they included this in this legislation at this point in this sort of, you know, the unfolding of this pandemic.
It just didn't add up. It seems like I was getting answers that it was strategic in order for the conservatives to sort of jump on that and then forget about the rest of the bill and pass that, but the conservatives to be fair to them, had signalled from the start they were prepared to support the economic measures that the government said they were going to introduce.
This aid package.
That's what Mr. Scheer reiterated today, they just didn't anticipate this unilateral power being added to it. We'll be interested to hear how the Prime Minister defends that action.



Everyone sort of set aside their concerns to get the aid package pushed through quickly to a bit of a clash yesterday, which is quite resolved.
But, David, you have thoughts.



**Reporter**:

It was kind of a clumsy move that brought politics back into the pandemic.
and up until this point, it had been a nonpartisan, municipal governments, federal governments, provincial government working across ideologies and party lines to do what is best for Canadian citizens and businesses.
and this was kind of a clumsy move and what was billed as an aid package has been defined as overreach by the government in trying to expand its powers.
You can understand the impulse.
Do not take this as justification, but in trying to understand the federal government's thought here, they want the ability to increase payments and cut taxes and offer tax relief without having to come back to parliament.
It was last week, Wednesday, when the Prime Minister announced the $82 billion aid package then backed up by the finance Minister.
You then have to get things drafted, send a letter to the speaker, recall parliament on 48hours notice and fly everybody back across the country.
Then the day in the house of commons.
Then the day in the senate.
Then royal assent and then you get your money out the door.
They need to ramp up government to handle these things.
I think they want to avoid a week lag because of the parliamentary requirements in doing any future increases.
If that was their intention -- and I'm being charitable in the interpretation -- that should have been telegraphed and discussed with the opposition parties well in advance of yesterday and a 21-month time limit on that until the end of 2021, someone should have had the political antenna and smarts to realize that was going to be a non-starter for the oppositionparties.
You can see four weeks, six weeks, subject to renewal, as Vassy said, a finite time frame, but taking a minority finance Minister with these kinds of powers is a non-starter in peacetime.



There are conservatives expressing concerns about other sections of the bill where they think there is still too much power over too long a period of time that has been given to the government in different sections.
That's why later around noon, we'll hear from the finance Minister inside the house of commons.
It's going to look pretty different.
You guys will be there with me. and there will be a period of time when the opposition parties can ask questions.
But the long and short of it, it will get passed and get royal assent tomorrow and people should start getting access to the money.
Which seems to be what everyone agrees on. There is another bit of news that has developed overnight.
The Tokyo summer Olympics have been postponed now until 2021 because of the pandemic.
Here's what the international Olympic committee said.
The Io president and the Prime Minister of japan concluded that the games of the 32nd Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date, but not later than summer 2021.
Of course, this comes just a day after team Canada signalled it would not send any of its athletes to japan to participate in the Olympics.
and now this big delay.
Scott Russell is always a big part of our Olympic coverage and he joins me now from Toronto.
Good to see you.
How big a deal is this?



It's a big deal.
This is unprecedented in terms of Olympic history.
As you know, the games have never been cancelled with the exception of world war and they haven't been postponed until now to this extent.
I think the really important thing here though, rosemary, thec-word was not used to the announcement.
The games have not been cancelled, they've been postponed.
I think it's likely that the games will be postponed for a year.
There are major logistical problems to work out with that postponement, but I think the international sporting communityand the ioc understands that canbe done.



It did seem to take a while for them to get there, though, when at a time regular people were saying this seems obvious, it isn't safe.
Do we know why it took so long?



There is a huge amount of negotiation that had to go on. Next year, world championships in the major sports were slated to occur.
World athletics championships ineugene, Oregon, the world aquatic championships, water polo, all that was to take place in japan.
That is next summer and the world artistic gymnastics championships in Copenhagen.
Stadiums had been built and the ioc.
Wanted all its ducks in a row to get the games to replace those world championships.
I think world athletics, the head of final, the world aquatics association as well as artistic gymnastics have all come together and said we'll forego the world championships in order to get the Olympics off the ground, a safe Olympics.



I was talking to one of the women's soccer players yesterday who was, you know, understood the decision that Canada had made, but was still upset she was sing missing -- was missing the Olympics.
Do you think this makes it easier for the athletes?



Absolutely, for the vast majority of the athletes, this is a plan and one they can get used to and begin their training for and time their wakening for.
As -- training for.
As you know, in international sport, timing is everything.
Here is one caveat to that.
For some senior athletes this may mean the end of a career.
I'm thinking about Brent Hayden, the 36-year-old swimmer who is making a comeback.
Won a bronze medal in 2012.
Melissa bishop, the 800-metre runner.
There is going to be sacrifice on the part of senior athletes with this postponement.



Okay, Scott Russell, always good to see you and appreciate you doing this from your house.
Thank you.



Lots of implications for athletes, coaches, sports fans around the world dealing with cancellations, but for reaction we did reach out to dick pound, Canadian member of the international Olympic committee, former vice president of the committee in Montreal today.



I think it's the right decision in the circumstances.
It's not an easy decision and that will create some complication but it's certainly better than exposing all your athletes to a dangerous situation.
So it was a tough call, but I think both the Japanese authorities and the Io have done the right thing and done it in plenty of time so that people will understand what is going on. The international sport calendar will have to be rejigged because most of the international federations have their 2021 programmes pretty well set.
But I think there will be lots of cooperation there, because everybody wants the Olympics to be held and benefit from the enormous audiences that you have.



International Olympic committee member dick pound in Montreal today responding to the major decision to postpone until2021, at least 2021, the Tokyo games that were scheduled for actually just four months exactly from today.
Of course, today the major focus in this country and in in town, the nation's capital is to try to get this financial aid package moving and into the hands of Canadians.
We're expecting it to pass aft era number of hours of debate inside the house of commons.
Limited debate.
It will then move into the senate tomorrow.
and the whole thing should receive royal assent by end of day Wednesday, which, of course, makes a big difference to many people who are wondering how they're going to pay rent or bills in the next couple of weeks.
There are also businesses, obviously, affected by all of this, having to make the difficult decision to lay peopleoff.
I want to bring in Howard acceptseen.
The travel agency based in Toronto.
and obviously, as international borders continue to close, I would imagine, Howard, your business has taken a serious hit.
How are you doing?



I'm doing fine, thanks for --thank you, rosemary.
[laughter] you know, there is no revenue coming in now.



No.



Absolutely none.
I spent the last week getting clients home making sure they got home, changes and what not.
But for the foreseeable future, there will be no income.
and that makes it difficult.
My income is completely through commissions.
My other agent here is completely on commission.
So we are self-employed.
We don't have access at the moment to any kind of ei.



So you're one of those people, self-employed people that doesn't pay into ei and normally wouldn't get it. You will now get access.
Have you registered on the government website?



It's interesting you said that.
I scoured that website and of course I'm symptom-free, so I'm not forced to stay home.
I'm not looking after a loved one, a family member who has COVID-19. Ei seems to be for those but notsomebody in My boat.
If you're saying different, that's great.
I look forward to trolling through the ei site to see if I qualify.



I am saying different because listened to a lot of briefings[laughter] from the ministers and if you are -- if you are self-employed, there is also measures there for you.
You may not find it yet on the website, but I would imagine after the legislation passes, that will become more apparent.



That would be great.
I mean, I got to tell you, when the Prime Minister came out -- was it last week? I mean time is fleeting here.
March 18th.
and talked about how they're going to inject all this money.
One of the things I did was reach out to the -- although -- what do they call it? the business development bank saying look I need some money.
I'm not creating masks or anything, but I need an infusion of cash just to keep going.
My landlord is asking me for rent.
I have communication going on at the moment.
But as I said, you know, it's the story of -- what is a good expression? I eat what I grow kind of thing.
If nothing is being produced, I have no revenue, no cash flow.
and interesting enough, I've been in this business a long time.
Since 1982.
and mph travel has been in business since 1986.
Although people sometimes when you're in a group setting which we haven't been for a while, say what do you do? you say, I run a travel agency, I sell travel.
They say, I thought you guys were, you know, nonexistent anymore, the web took over.
and it made me think of mark twain.
The reports on My desk was an exaggeration.
I got to tell you, people I talked to this week, in particular last weekend, when the fear went out we're closing the borders.
and you know people were contacting me from Australia where they were yet to come home, from Europe, Dublin, Florida.
and you know, at least they were able to contact me, not wait on the phone and -- don't get me wrong -- the airlines are busy and they're doing the best job they can.
I've seen the tweets and what not, horror stories, but there is more to it. People were able to reach out tome.
and at least I could say to them, okay, we're going to get you home, when can you leave? you know, some people couldn't leave right away.
Comes to mind is someone travelling home with their cat.
I mean, there is all kinds of things.



Sure.
Howard, I'm going to cut you off, not because I don't want tolisten, but I'm waiting for the Prime Minister to come up. Let me tell you that My colleague David Cochrane also just messaged me and told me, yes, you do qualify for the emergency support programme.
So if you have any trouble, e-mail me and I'll send you the link if you can't find it. You're one of many Canadians struggling right now.
It's good to see you in such good spirits.
I wish you well.



That will happen for the next 14 days.
We've got the CBC Meagan Fitzpatrick at the Ontario legislature in Toronto and the CBC news Montreal host, Debra arbec in Montreal.
What will be open, closed in quÉbec, how is the government approaching this?



If you don't mind, if you'll indulge me, we just got new information I want to give you.
It's about front-line workers that are infected with COVID-19. Two paramedics have been ineffected in an area northeast of montreal.
That's an important area becausethat's where COVID-19 -- quÉbec's rather four cases of COVID-19 were reported.
So four elderly people died at aseniors home there.
We still don't know how the ambulance technicians were infected, but what we do know, they were not involved with any interventions with the seniors home.
The two ambulance technicians inquarantine.
18 other technicians that came into contact with them have beentaken off the job.
Some have been tested.
We're still waiting to find out more, but they're all self-isolating at this point.
That's on top of two montreal police officers who were infected and a firefighter on the island of montreal at the westmount station who has also tested positive for the coronavirus.
So, now, for the first time in quÉbec, the premier is saying that there is community transmission of COVID-19 in the province, so health officials are trying to slow that spread.
Too many people are still gathering groups, so like Ontario, the premier announced yesterday all nonessential businesses must close across theprovince.
So it's as of midnight tonight.
I'll go through the list.
He knows it's disruptive, says it was necessary though because of all the new cases reported yesterday.
Across the province, it's probably easier to go through a list of what actually is open.
Anything health-related, veterinarian, takeout restaurants, because the province wants people to get easy access to food.
Deliveries will continue.
If you're working out of your home, you can still have deliveries to your home.
Banks are open.
Hardware stores are open.
Public transit.
All communications, including journalists can still go to work.
The liquor store in quÉbec as well as marijuana stores still open at this point.
They're talking about food security still being open.
So as I mentioned, you can stillwork at home.
That is not an issue.
You can still get deliveries.
It's very similar to the situation that has been unfolding in Ontario, but there is one big difference.
That is that construction sites here in quÉbec are shutting down.
So whether it's private or public, got a lot of big construction projects going on in quÉbec right now, all of themhave to shut down at midnight tonight.



**Rosemary**:

I will say one of the concerns we've heard from Dr. Tam, Canada's chief medical officer, is that the virus starts to infect health care workers, front-line workers.
and unions have talked about a lack of personal protective equipment.
Don't know if that is the case.
But there was a change in reporting that quÉbec made yesterday.
So their number of cases took a drastic -- it looked like a big spike.
Can you tell us anything about what that change was and why they decided to do that?



There were a few things there.
a huge spike yesterday, so that quÉbec now has the most cases across the country, well over 600 now.
What happened is that -- there are a few things.
First of all, many are on schoolbreak, a couple of weeks before the rest of the country, so we were getting many quÉbecers coming back from vacation, many of them infected by COVID-19. We saw those numbers spike.
We're also counting cases differently.
Originally, we were sending cases out to Manitoba, to Winnipeg, to have the tests analyzed, now we're able to do that here.
So we're doing far more tests.
The government has said over the last couple of weeks, expect that we are going to see a spike because we're going to now be testing more often and we're going to be getting a backlog of those tests.
and so that's what happened over the last couple of days.
They're also combining presumed cases as well as confirmed cases, so all of that combines to why we saw that spike yesterday.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, Debra arbec, good to get the picture in quÉbec.
Now to Meagan Fitzpatrick, she'sstanding by in the Ontario legislature in Toronto.
Ontario took similar moves as we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister to speak to Canadians.
Give us a sense of why the government made the decision and what will stay open?



**Reporter**:

So, what is not allowed to stay hope, has to close at midnight tonight, and stay closed for at least the next 14 days, but premier Doug ford did leave the door open to extend the orders beyond 14 days if the government deems necessary.
They posted a list last night of what is considered essential.
In other words, what can say open.
They didn't put out a separate list of what has to close.
You have to look at the list and figure it out.
As we expected, grocery stores are on there.
Convenience stores.
Pet food stores as well, for pet owners out there concerned about having enough supplies for theirpets.
Also, I. T. providers, office supply stores.
That's probably important for all those people working at home right now and might need support.
Liquor, beer, wine, cannabis, all allowed to continue operating.
Food is similar to what Debra was saying, take out and delivery only, no in restaurant dining.
Taxi can keep operating and hotels.
Construction sites can keep operating.
Those are on the list of essential operation services andbusinesses.
Premier Doug ford said yesterday he has been made aware of concerns expressed about construction sites and he essentially told some companies to get their acts together and make sure they're providing a safe environment for their workers.
He's likely to get more questions about this when he Hausa press conference around 1:00 p. M., in terms of what made the list and what didn't. What I'm hearing from some in the business community, there is not a lot of clarity.
They're looking for more specifics on this list.
They're saying it's too vague, some of those categories.
So, for example, the Canadian federation of independent business, the Ontario chapter representative was saying they're hearing from members who operate car washes.
Gas stations are allowed to stayopen.
If a car wash is attached to the gas station, can it operate? limo drivers.
Do they count as taxi drivers? taxi drivers are on the list, but limo drivers are not listed specifically.
They're urging the government to set up a hot line so that businesses, companies can call and ask and get a quick answer, yes or no, can they stay open.
The chamber of commerce urged the government to delay the implementation of the orders saying companies and businesses haven't been given enough notice.
The premier made the announcement yesterday afternoon.
a few hours later put out the list.
Whoever is not on the list is supposed to close down midnight tonight.
They say companies need nor time to adapt, to shift their operations online, have their staff work from home.
They are allowing companies to keep operating through telework, online commerce is still allowed, but companies scrambling to make that happen if they can.
They're asking the premier for more time.



**Rosemary**:

As you said, an update from the premier later.
Thank you for that.
We are expecting when the premier speaks later at 1:00 eastern, the government sources say he'll also be announcing that hydro rates will be temporarily lowered to lower rates during the day in order to help people that are working from home and have to use more hydro.
We're expecting to hear that from the Ontario premier as well.
We are standing by, though, at this hour to bring you our regular update from the Prime Minister in his home there where he is nearing the end of his self-isolation, although he hasn't given an exact date when he'll be able to come out and enjoy the rest of us and possibly work in the office fromtime to time.
He is now, we're told, running alittle bit late.
11:45 is now the time we are expecting to hear from the Prime Minister, 11:45 eastern.
and reminder that today, the focus here in this city and really across the country, if that affects you and it does forso many, is the government getting the emergency aid measures passed.
We heard yesterday almost a million Canadians had registeredfor employment insurance over the past week.
On average, it is something like35, 000 I believe is the number that I last saw.
An enormous amount of people looking for this help.
and a lot of people -- a lot more people will need it going forward.
We know that, too.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos anddavid Cochrane.
David, I'm going to you.
Let's maybe because our friend howard the travel agent was trying to understand what he wasgoing to have access to, I thinkhe's relieved that he's going to get something.
Let's go through what was available.
