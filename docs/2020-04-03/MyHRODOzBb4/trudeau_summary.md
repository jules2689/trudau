### Summary:

 This legislation will help ensure that Canadians are getting the support they need during these challenging times.
All of us in parliament must work together and Canadians need to see us doing just that.
As we deliver support to Canadians as quickly as possible.




I know a lot of Canadians abroad are still having trouble to find a flight to bring them home.
They've been on the front lines of this crisis for weeks, but they continue to show up to work and bring families together.
Just this past week, nearly 1 million Canadians travelled home to Canada.
This would not have been possible without the people who work at our airports, the border and our ports.
So on behalf of all Canadians, thank you.
We talked about working even more closely together to do more to keep Canadians safe.
The federal emergencies act is Alas resort, but as I keep saying, all options are on the table.
Right now there are people who are still going to work because they have to. Pharmacists, delivery folks, postal workers, custodial staff, truck drivers and many, many more are keeping the country running.
and do it for the health care workers who we can't afford to lose during the biggest public health crisis our country has ever seen, because here's the hard truth.




We recognize the need to help Canadians directly and quickly.
People are worried about affording their groceries, they're worried about paying their rent, they're worried about how they're going to stay safe and keep their families safe when they don't have revenue coming in.
and we are working very, very hard to be able to flow money to people very rapidly.
We're looking at a broad range of measures for supporting vulnerable people, for supporting businesses, small businesses specifically, and giving more help to Canadians.
We will continue to work and roll out those measures as we move forward.




We recognize this pandemic is moving extremely quickly and it is a situation that requires extreme flexibility and rapidity of response by governments to be able to help Canadians and reacts to a situation that we'veseen is moving quickly every single day.
So saying we have a parliament that works, we have an opposition that is doing its job of making sure that we're taking the right steps the right way and that's why we've been working on drafting the right legislation up until the last minute.
We've been in close discussion with the opposition parties to find a way to both get that flexibility to be able to get measures out the door, and keep in place our democratic institutions and the values that are so important to us all.
We will always ensure that our system works in a robust way both around accountability and helping Canadians as quickly as is necessary in these exceptional circumstances and that is exactly what we're going to see this afternoon in what I'm sure will be robust, but extremely cooperative and collaborative debate this afternoon in the house.




Well, I think we all acknowledge that we're in a situation where people's behavior and choices and the choices we make as a government may be different from what we would do in a situation that is not an emergency. As I know, everything is on the table, but this is not somethingwe're doing at this point in time and it's not something that we are contemplating for the days to come.



I think we recognize that in an emergency situation we need to take certain steps that wouldn't be taken in non emergency situations.
But as I said, all options are on the table to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe in these exceptional times.



We had a good discussion on the federal emergencies act, recognizing that most provinces and territories, if not all, have brought in their own emergencies act to be able to deal with the situation.
Some premiers were more open to it than others, but all of them indicated an openness to continue the discussions to make sure we're able as individual jurisdictions, but also as a country, to do everything necessary to keep Canadians safe.
We recognize the deeply integrated supply chains that go back and forth across the United States and we'll continue to ensure that essential supplies of medication, of industrial equipment, of food, continue to flow.
At the same time, we are continuing in Canada to base our decisions and our recommendations and guidelines to Canadians on science.
We recognize that the need for social distancing, which means keeping two metres apart and not gathering in groups, is going to be in place for many more weeks.
and we will ensure that we are giving the support to Canadians, to small businesses, so as we get through this, we're able to restore the economic activity that keeps us all prosperous when it is safe to do so. Our priority is keeping Canadians alive and healthy.
At this time we feel that the measures we have taken to restrict flow across the border, to essential travel and essential goods, is the -- sorry, to goods and essential travel is the important thing that we're doing to keep Canadians safe.
