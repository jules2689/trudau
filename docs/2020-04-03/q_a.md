**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): Mr. Morneau, first question on the budget date.
Can you tell us that the budge twill be tabled afterapril 20th or beforeapril 20th?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): thank you for the question.
As it now stands we're looking at measures to take next week to stimulate our economy.
and to ensure that we will protect Canadians.
That's very important.
We have an agreement with the other parties that we might have an immediate session if necessary to protect and stimulate our economy and to protect Canadians.
I am sure that we will have these measures in place for our economy and for Canadians nextweek.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): well, that didn'treally answer My question.
The budget -- will it be table dafter April 20th? and My follow-up question, ofthose $10 billion in credits forbusinesses, can you tell us moreabout that amount.
What will it be used for? are there conditions, and is itonly for small and medium-sizedbusiness? can any business access thatfund? how will that operate?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Thapthat's a good question and we want to support Canadians andit's important to support our businesses which are stilloperating.
and we have introduced a couple of good measures and an additional $300 billion incapacity.
and this $10 billion in credit.
Which will will be advanced by the -- business development bank and the export development bank.
Those moneys will go to small and medium-sized businesses andthey'll be able to accesscredit.
They'll be able to protect theirbusinesses in this context ofuncertainty when they willperhaps see lower revenues.
So accessing that money will beimportant for them.
The $300 billion is for theeconomy as a whole.
It is for our financialinstitutions and for the economyas a whole.
The $10 billion, most of thatmoney will go to small andmedium-sized enterprises.



Right here.
Afterwards in the back.

**Question**:

This is shellyhaigen with bloom berg news.
What changed in the last 24hours that led to this coordinated response from the bank of Canada and the financedepartment?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

We've been working as I think that you know from day one on how we can ensure that we are not only protecting canadiansbut protecting our long-termeconomy.
What is clear to us is that thefirst step is and always shouldbe the protection of people'shealth, the protection of healthcare system, and that's why wemoved forward in that regardfirst and foremost.
and we also though recognizedthat we have a much biggerimpact on our economic health ifwe act in a coordinated way.
That's what led us to worktogether to make sure that wehave a coordinated response.
and it's differently differentin different sectors of thegovernment, yes, butcoordinated.
and I think that it's similar towhat we're working oninternationally.
The Prime Minister will have acall with g7 leaders on mondayand I have been in touch with myg7 counterparts and we areworking together withinstitutions like theinternational monetary fund atthe same time.
and we know that economicmeasures that we take have thebigger and more important impacton our economy and, therefore, amore important way that we canprotect Canadians if we work ina coordinated and collaborativeway.

---

**Question**:

What measures have you been discussing to introduce in the stimulus package nextweek?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Whatwe're looking at for next week is ensuring that we can give comfort to Canadians, that they during a time when they might not have the same funds they would normally have if they have to be off work, that they have the capacity to continue supporting themselves and theirfamilies.
So we're looking at direct measures to support individual sand families.
We're also always considering how we can make sure that their employment opportunities stayrobust.
We're assuring that we have away to deliver that, that it gives people the resources they need at the right time.





---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): good evening, Mr. Morneau, two banks said thatcanada would fall into are cession shortly.
What do you think of that given the evolving situation? do you believe that Canada will fall into a recession?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): well, we know that there is a level ofuncertainty.
It's a significant level ofuncertainty.
Because the situation is fluid.
So at this moment it's hard to assess the significance and the length of the coronavirussituation.
So it's hard at this moment to predict what will happen.
However, I know that it is very important to bring about measures which will stabilize our economy and that is why we are here today in a coordinated measure to present the measures that we're taking.
Next week we will have stimulus -- a stimulus package.
and this will reassure people who will know that they will have the money they need to be in a good position for themselves and their families.
So that's important.
and they will also know thatthey'll be able to continue to work with their companies.
So there are some things that we will look at this weekend andwe'll have an announcement to make next week.

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): a question formr.
Poloz.
You are going to retire thisyear.
Are you going to delay your retirement given the fact that this crisis is just starting? and that the bank of Canada will have a role to play.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Well, no, that's not really aconsideration.
We are a team at the bank ofcanada.
We have an excellent team.
and I am confident that -- have confidence in that team.
So I do not intend to delay my retirement date.
No.



May I say that in My view we are pleased to have someone like governor pol oz here today with us to help us to deal with this situation which is highlyuncertain.



On the other side.


---

**Question**:

Thank you, governorpoloz, if you could provide some insight into what the board of governor saw as a change to require the emergency move? and what is the new rate for thed.
B.s. Moving forward? that would be great.



Okay, for our part, I'm going to say that the main fundamental that has changed since our last decision is that oil prices continue to move lower.
and they have -- they're showing signs of persisting in that.
It's a difficult analysis to make at this stage.
But, you know, analysing those risks suggest that we need to consider carefully the implications of a much lower oil price for the economy.
It's, of course, the blunt end of that effect is that in certain regions, oil-producingregions, but as we have talkedabout in late 2014 and early2015, those effects go acrossthe entire economy.
and so just on the strength ofthose moves alone, there'sfundamental reasons forsubstantial response formonetary policy.
Our timing today I think isintended to capitalize on thecoordinated aspect of theannouncement that is, you know, there's some significantmeasures happening today andearly next week which I thinkthat people should see as acoordinated and very powerfulpackage.
and that should -- well, myconcern about this is how thebusiness confidence and consumerconfidence, how they willweather this storm.
We believe that this istemporary but it can beprolonged if the confidence isunduly damaged.
So these actions are meant tobolster that confidence and giveus a bridge across the trouble.



So it's now at one percentage point or a 100 basis points if you prefer.
It was set at 2.25%, which is what would have come in effect at the end of April.
So the reduction is 1.25% or 125basis points.

**Question**:

Minister morneau, your stimulus package thatyou're planning to announce next week could be a multibilliondollars and up to potentially$20 billion.
is that a figure that you'relooking at right now?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Whatwe're doing and what we'reassuring Canadians is that we are able to deliver to them the support they need financially, individually, for them and theirfamilies.
We also know that we want to stabilize the economy.
So as we do that, we're making sure that we have sufficiently important stimulus that can actually achieve the important goals for families, individuals, and businesses.
But also recognize that our overall goal is to stabilize theeconomy.
and we'll have more to say on both the exact quantum and the measures next week.



Radio-Canada.

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): Mr. Morneau, you have announced support for small and medium-sized businesses, a$10 billion package.
There will be other programmes, more to be forthcoming.
I would like to ask you thefollowing question -- have youensured or will you ensure thatthere will not be too much redtape associated with theseprogrammes?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, it's very important for us to look at the how to deliver opportunities to Canadians and to businesses and this is why we will look at how our approach can resemble that which has already been done in the past.
We will choose the same approach we chose in 2008-2009.
It's a tested approach.
and under this approach, small and medium-sized enterpriseswill be able to keep on turningto their financial institutions.
It's an easy way for them to goforward.
and so for businesses to dealwith the business developmentbank and the export developmentbank.
So there will be mow red tape.
We have a tested method which iseasy to use by businesses.
So they can rest assured that we will be there for them and fortheir employees.

---

**Question**:

Well, this leads me to ask a third question.



No, you only have two.

---

**Question**:

So these programmes-- they will be targeted atbusinesses? you said that there will be no red tape.
But what about canadiansthemselves, individuals?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): well, it's the same approach.
We want to find ways to deliver opportunities to all Canadians.
So there is no issue to the support that we will be giving.
We'll have the answers to the question of how that help will be delivered.

---

**Question**:

If I may, to stay on the issue of red tape, in crisis people don't like redtape.
So have you decided to allow people to file their income tax returns at a later time?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

(voice of translator): we are looking at that right now.
We are looking at how to get the necessary support on that.
We'll have more to say to that next week.

---

**Question**:

Mr. Morneau, the help that will be coming tocanadians, one of the question sis that some people have precarious positions, the gigeconomy.
You're talking about direct measures to help people.
But you're also talking about broader issues of stabilization.
Will the money, will theprogrammes, actually help the people who are losing income right now or will it be broader and you'll try to catch all of these people? or will it be directed at people who are actually having problems as Mr. Trudeau says, paying their rent and their mortgage?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

The frame that I'd like you to think about is, first of all, we want to believe able to stabilize oureconomy.
So fiscal stimulus ispersonality.
But what we're looking at is the direct impact on Canadians.
So Canadian situations are different and that's why we need to make sure that we consider those situations.
There are Canadians in our employment insurance system.
There are Canadians who aren'tin our employment insurance system because they may not have enough hours or in a different kind of work environment.
So in that regard we need to think about how we can appropriately ensure that we can support people in differentsituations.
and that's the work that we'redoing right now.

---

**Question**:

I'm asking for colleague here.
What has the industry told you about vulnerabilities and theeconomy, with the businesses that have to protect against losses caused by business disruptions related to thepandemic?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

It'san important question and think that what we'll see is that there's many questions with different industries.
We're looking at sectoralimpacts to look at how best torespond.
But to be clear, what we'resaying from a federal government standpoint is that we're going to do whatever it takes to support and stabilize oureconomy.
We have the fiscal capacity as the country has the best balancesheet, we have the capacity todo this.
So in a sense what we're doing is trying to provide that bridge for organisations and for people as they go through a time, temporary time, as governorpoloz mentioned, of stress as ares ult of an external force that none of us could have predicted.



We're going to go to torontostar and after that politico.

---

**Question**:

Hi, good afternoon, Bruce smith with Toronto star.
To Minister morneau, can you talk about the stimulus amount that is needed to keep the economy out of rescission? will this force any phonements? -- postponements?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Whati'd like to say is that the scale of the response will be against the scale of thechallenge.
We're trying to make sure that we do what it takes in order to stabilize our economy.
That means considering the issues facing individualcanadians.
It also means considering the overall impact that we're seeing in the economy.
That's what we'll work towards.
It's important that we address the issue that we're facing.
Importantly, this will mean that we will have the potential to come back to the house as required and the house ofcommons, and I think that as you know that it is standing down.
As that happens we have an agreement with all parties that we can come back should we need to pass emergency measures.
Shot what I'm focused on right now and that's I think that we should be focused on ascanadians want to know thatwe're protecting them, we'reprotecting health care system and ensuring that our economy continues to have the strength that it needs to provide continued employment.

---

**Question**:

a date?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

As say we're focused on those measures as the first order of business and we'll have more to say on that in future.

---

**Question**:

a question to governor poloz.
Just with today's announcement of a rate cut, you're almost out of bullets it would seem.
What happens if further action is needed? are there other remedies?



Well, as I said we stand ready to take further action if we think that it's needed.
and we have a variety of other tools in the toolkit.
Some which we are mentioningtoday.
You know, the bankers' acceptance purchases is no smalldeal.
That's an important place where we have observed credit stresses already for small andmedium-sized issuers.
and so if we can provide reliefto that, again, many of thesemeasures are positioned so thatthe banking system continues towork.
It's not about doing somethingseparate from that.
The bank system continues towork well and people are able totap their credit lines, etc., uninterrupted to get themthrough this, then I think we will have achieved majorbuffering action.
But other things that we can dois if those channels do getclogged in the sort of creditspace such as, you know, lendingin order to fund or more creditor lending directly ourselves to the system, and for sure we'rein a position to put plenty ofliquidity at the hands of thebanks and those demands continueto rise for their credit linesand they'll need to fund thoseincreases.
and if the funding markets forbanks get a little choppy, they've been a little choppy, but they could get tighter, andthen we're in a position to helpthem with that.
For example, using -- acceptingmortgage -- parts of mortgagebooks as collateral.
This was a capability that wedidn't have back in 2008 but wehave put all of those piecestogether in the interveningyears.
So that means that there's avery big stock of potentialfunding capacity from thecentral bank through thatchannel.
and if those -- if the stresses in the international markets goup, at the moment they'refunctioning reasonably well, again, these are safeguards to ensure that the system as weknow it continues to functionwell.
I think that it gets us throughthis.
and other measures like EDC and BDC Are like backups, youknow, and especially in thesmall and medium-sized companyspace where it's more likely toshow up. and it's harder to do this.



Last one politico.

---

**Question**:

What can you tell us about what kind of coordinated response we can expect from the g7?



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

We are in constant communication with our internationalcounterparts.
I know the Prime Minister has been in regular communication.
I think that you would have heard that he spoke to president trump yesterday and he spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy and he spoke to the prime minister of the united kingdom.
He is having a call with his g7counterparts on Monday.
So that first and foremost isquite important.
The g7 finance Minister andcentral bank governors are inregular contact.
The governor informed me that hehad spoken to the -- to the United States federal reserve bank leader justbefore coming here today.
and that is consistent with howi'm communicating with mycolleagues internationally as well.
Clearly the situation isdifferent in differentcountries.
So we're looking at measuresthat will be different based onthe different situations.
But we're working to -- tocoordinate in a way that meansthat we can have a moresignificant impact than anyonewould have individually.
and I think that you'll continueto see that level of workingtogether which we know that isimportant.

---

**Question**:

Governor poloz, I'mwondering, are you willing to consider to move rates into negative territory if necessary? and can monetary policy be effective when the rates are already so low?



As I said in My openingremarks, it does have a material effect -- even if -- even if itdoesn't promote additional spending in the economy.
Which is normally the way that you think of it. But, you know, every monththere's a stock of people who are renewing their mortgages.
and if their mortgage payments go down because of the lower rates then they have more free cash flow afterwards so that helps to cushion the blow of these things.
If they're on a variable rate mortgage it's automatic to get that cash flow.
So these are not, you know, simple things, these are quite important channels of influence.
But also as I said in My speech week or so ago, if you -- if you use these actions to buttress consumer confidence, what can happen is that if those people are planning to actually enter the housing market, thenthere's a lower barrier for them to get into it and then their confidence is buttressed by the collective action that is going through the system with other major purchases.
So in situations like this it'sconsumer and business confidence which tend to erode and that causes decisions to slow down regardless of how much capacity there is in the system.
and so we want to have people understand that we're on the job and that we're going to stabilize the economy.
Negative interest rates --ueknow, I don't -- you know, idon't think that I'm alone with the central bankers, we don'tlike the idea that much.
It's in the toolkit and we know from the experience of other countries that it can have an additional effect on the margin.
It's not a happy place for the banking system and so, ofcourse, it's usually in situations where there may be less fiscal firepower.
and I think that what we'reseeing today is evidence that --that there is fiscal firepower.
I know that the Minister has said it clearly before thatwe've got -- we've got capacity.
and so that's very helpful.
It means that the idea of negative interest rates is something that we can put up on the shelf and know that it'sthere.
But it's very unlikely to be needed given the firepower that we have.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Andi'd just like to add, I mean, it should not be lost on you or oncanadians that the Minister of finance and the governor of the central bank of Canada are sitting beside each other today talking about the importance of coordinating action on the monetary front and on the fiscalfront.
We have the capacity to act on the fiscal front, to protectcanadians.
and that's what we intend ondoing.
We have the capacity to act on the fiscal front to make sure that we continue to have Strong economy.
That's what we are committing todo.
and the work that the bank ofcanada is doing to make sure that our financial system works, to help to ensure that canadianshave confidence is criticallyimportant.
So working together, including with the superintendent, isimportant.
and we're looking forward to having more to say to you and tocanadians next week.
I'll just tell you as a small and an important human interest story that when you saw the superintendent giving a speech, I want you to know that when he did the french he was translating it as he went along because he only had his notes inenglish.
So kudos to him.
He can do this in bothlanguages.
So, thank you very much.
It was good to be here with youtoday.
(voice of translator): thank you very much for your time.
