**Vassy**:

I did.
I don't want to preempt everything he says.
He did not want to overstep the prime Minister.
But I will make this point and think this is what, for me, was the sort of substance of My line of questioning and has to do with what you brought up. That is the United States response versus what we are seeing in other parts of the world, including this country.
There is a desire on the part of the g20 and g7 to have some level of coordination in that response and the glow of communication remaining open or more open, I guess, than normal.
What's important when it comes to the United States response and you'vebeen talking about it for a few days on this special, is sort of what is happening with the public health aspect of this south of the border and particularly in new York state, where we are seeing massive increases in the virus, in the incidents of the virus, as well as hospitalizations and deaths because of it, too.
The president has come out for the past 48 hours, a bit longer, actually, and said we want the country back up and running byeaster, we think that'spossible.
and he's focusing on the economic impact on all of this, which, of course, will be huge and nobody is arguing againstthat.
It raises the question for this government in how it approaches its own relationship with the United states and more to the point how it approaches theborder.
They have talked at length how unprecedented the restriction sat the border are.
In our interview, ministerfrancois-philippe champagne saysthey've closed down that border.
He was extremely hesitant toacknowledge they might have togo further.
If circumstances do continue tochange, if, in fact, the United States does go against the advice ofpublic health officials andreopen the economy in two weeks, does that require even moreaggressive measures at theborder for this government? so far, nobody has really bittenon that, but I think thatquestion will sort of increasein its significance over thecoming days if the rhetoriccoming from the white house alsocontinues down this path.
and so I think the Prime Minister will likely getquestions on that.
I think that impacts therelationship between theinformation going on. I think we'll hear more wherethat economic benefit isconcerned and I think they areanxious to keep driving home themessage around the emergencybenefit, who qualifies, how manymore people can access it andhow that process unfolds.
I'm told that will be a big partof the message today.



**Rosemary**:

I should tellpeople, because we got many questions as we were trying to understand it, there's an article our website where it will spell out the many questions you have.
Just on the issue of Canada and the United States, an ongoing issue given the spike in the number ofcases, which is much higher when you look at the curb of the globe than what's happening incanada.
But the economy is also under enormous amount of strain there, as well.
Three million Americans are now seeking employment benefits andthat's the highest on recordsince, I think, the early '80s, when they were this a dramatic recession and they passed their own massive stimulus package TA trillion dollars at the same time we did.
I will just get Catherine cullento way in on the quarantine act which did take effect last nigh tat midnight and we're hoping from better messaging on thatfront, from the Prime Minister, because it was a fairly confusing message yesterday.
So maybe you can help us understand it as well.



We're hearing a lot of questions about that and people asking how they are particularly or their loved ones might be affected by the quarantine act.
Some of the questions, we have some answers to. What were are the potentialpenalties? it's in place as of midnight, go into a 14-day quarantine.
According to the penalties, maximum penalty, up to $750, 000or six months and/or six monthsimprisonment and officialspointed out in that communique, if you have done something whereyou have jeopardized somebody'slife, so if you're contagiousand irresponsible, the penaltiesscan be up to a million dollars, three years in prison or both.
I know another thing a lot ofpeople are wondering about iswhat happens if I'm transitingthrough an airport? we know many flights are beingpushed into vancouver, toronto, montreal, but what if you livein winnipeg or here in ottawa? officials are saying as long youare not symptomatic or showingsymptoms of COVID-19, you canget on that connecting flightand they also say you can get onpublic transit, but again, onlyif you're not symptom quick.
Atic.
If you're supposed to bequarantining, it's not clear whyyou would be allowed to get onpublic transit.
People have a lot of questionsand picking up on some vassysaid that is related, thismandatory quarantine is aresponse to further tighteningthe borders but when it comes to the United States, there's areal question about what canadacan do. They have to continue orseemingly, the flow of trade, right? we know food, medical devices, so many important things comefrom the United States andcanada is so dependent.
So how do you further tightenthe regulations if, indeed, that's what you want to do? I don't think that's clear?



**Rosemary**:

The government did confirm this morning we have anew ambassador in the United States, Kristen hillman, who was there through the naftanegotiations and has a lot of relationships in Washington.
I leave you to colleagues, if you don't mind, and we'll comeback to you as soon as the Prime Minister emerges from rideaucottage but I want to go tokalmir, who is a registered nurse who tested positive didn'tsigned up to ease nursing shortages by offering to do sometelehealth calls.
She is self-isolating now athome and she joins me on thephone.
How are you feeling?



Still feeling it by the sign of My voice but I'm feelingfine, thank you.
I know other Canadians are experiencing worse than I am andi'm thinking of them and we'llget through this together.



**Rosemary**:

So many people whodon't have this and trying to understand what it feels like, can you give them a sense of howyou're feeling or how it feels differently than a previous illness or another kind ofillness?



Well, I can tell you that, honestly, I've been feeling mildflu-like symptoms throughout.
It comes and goes and seems likeone of the worst flus that youcan have.
That's what it feels like.
and you have some good days, some bad days and today seemslike a better day for me.



**Rosemary**:

You are registered nurse and obviously, you know all about public health and I imagine you were protecting yourself.
What does that tell you aboutcovid-19 and how contagious itis?



Well, I think what'simportant to understand is that we need to be extremely mindful and follow the recommendations that our public health officials are reminding us every singleday.
and just know that no one is immune to it. We all have to be very, verycareful.
It is in our communities and you can be a healthy individual likemyself, that was practicing social distancing and wanted to make sure I'm washing My hand.
Just know you have to be very, very mindful of what you'redoing.
So please follow the expertadvice.
Stay at home.
I can't stress that enough.
Stay at home and practise social and physical distancing, selfisolate.
We owe it to Canadians, to ourfront-line workers, to ourseniors and every single one ofus has a part to play in tryingto get through this together.



**Rosemary**:

I know you answered the call to be atelehealth nurse.
Were you able to even start that before you got ill? and if so, why was it so important for you to get involved in that?



Well, honestly, Rosie, when is aw the initial call for action to the nursing shortage, there was no hesitation that I was not going to put My hand up. Helping people at the front lines is My passion and I'veworked at the front lines before getting involved in politics.
It's one of the reasons why Igor involved in politics and it was an absolute no-brainer forme to register to put My nameforward.
I still remain on that list.
I look forward to contributingto the front lines when I'mcalled.
I, unfortunately, didn't have achance to, but I look forward todoing that even virtually nowthat I'm home.
But I also wanted to make suretheir use My voice to shed thelight on the reality that wecould possibly have a shortageof nurses and amplify themessage.
I'm so proud that over 4500retired or nonpracticing nursesthat have signed up for it andhave registered with ourvolunteers and I'm so incrediblyproud of this group and can'tthank them enough for whatthey're doing.



**Rosemary**:

Do you have any idea how you got it, how you got the virus?



Well, as I said, I think it'sa wide-spread virus and so manypeople may have it and are stillwalking around in our grocerystores and walking aroundoutside.
They think as Dr. Tam said, thisvirus sees no colour or age.
We have to stay at home andpractise physical distancing andit's so important we listen to the experts and I commend theleadership of Dr. Tam, and ourprime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

Just to be clear, it was someone that you met, someone in the community or something like that?



As I said, we simply don'tknow because just like everyoneelse, every other Canadian, I'mtrying to do our part from -- id id travel from Ottawa totoronto when we came back after the house froze and I did go Tommy office once or twice and did try to do grocery shopping before I knew that I had to beprepared.
and again, I think it's just important for us to listen to the advice of our public healthofficials.
Please stay at home and follow the instructions of our public health officials every singleday.



**Rosemary**:

I think you talked to the Prime Minister yesterdayand, of course, his wife, sophiegregoire-trudeau, is sort ofcoming on the other side of thisnow.
Did he have any advice in termsof how to keep working and howto cope with the virus itself?



Yes.
I was extremely touched that he took the time to call me, considering all of his otherpriorities.
He called to just check in to see how I was doing.
Also to share his experience, as you mentioned, having been through it with Sophie and some of the ups and downs ofsymptoms.
It was really nice to have him give tips working from home, which I know so many canadiansare doing right now.
It was also important to catch up considering we haven't seen each other since the house rose and had a chance to tell him what I've been hearing from the ground in My community and why his messages, everyday, are so important to Canadians and the work that we have been doing every single day, whether it'sbringing Canadians home or helping people that are struggling everyday during this unprecedented time.



**Rosemary**:

As you and othercanadians struggle with thevirus, we wish you the best ofhealth.



Thank you so much, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

Thanks for taking the time.
I know it's not the first thing top of mind when you're going through this but it's important to have Canadians hear from you.
Get well soon and we'll talk when you're out ofself-isolation.
That's kamal kara, the mp forbrampton west.
Today, a g20 meeting was heldwith world leaders where theyagreed this was, obviously, thetop priority around the worldand we're expecting to hear morefrom him about that and here isthe Prime Minister of Canada.
Let's listen in live now.
Hello everyone.
(speaking french).



Yesterday, our emergency plan to help Canadians was passed by parliament with even more generous measures that will help even more Canadians.
We're talking about $107 billion for workers, families and businesses that are going through tough times because ofcovid-19. We are now introducing a single benefit that Canada emergency response benefits to workers who have lost their income because of the pandemic.
Whether you are eligible for Dior not been that benefit is there to help you.
People will receive $2, 000 from the government every month for the next several months.
We'll be launching an online portal so people can applyquickly, receive money and receive money in the next tendays.
Our plans to help Canadians, save jobs and support our economy was adopted by parliament with more generous measures to help even morecanadians and we're now talking about $107 billion to support people and businesses.
We launched the new canadaemergency response benefit which will provide $2, 000 a month for up to four months to people who are not getting paid as a result of COVID-19. This will replace the two benefits we announced last week to make it even simpler for you to get help.
An application portal will launch as quickly as possible and people should start receiving money within 14 days of applying.
As part of this plan, we'll also be boosting the Canada child benefit for families in May.
Parents already know how much the CB helps with the cost of raising kids.
By increasing the ccb, we'll put more money in the pockets of families to help them navigate these uncertain times.
and for people who are still paying off their student loans, we're putting a six-monthinterest-free moratorium ontheir Canada student loans.
You can find more information onwhat else we're doing and how toaccess your benefits@Canada.
Ca. I'm sorry to say, there appearsto be a tech scam going aroundon the new emergency responsebenefit.
I want to remind everyone thatthe government's website is thebest place to find reliableinformation on everything we'redoing.
(speaking french).



You can consult the site, Canada.
Ca to receive more information to counter COVID-19and on the way to have access tobenefits.
Unfortunately, some people havereceived a text message thatseemed to come from thegovernment with respect to thenew emergency benefit.
This is a scam.
I want to remind you that thegovernment website is the bestplace to find reliableinformation about what we'redoing.
It's clear that the pandemic isplacing a lot of pressure on ourhealthcare system, on employmentinsurance and particularly thegovernment apparatus, but knowthat we're doing everything we can to shorten the deadlines.
I know that bills are piling upand pressure is mounting andthat concerns many, manyfamilies, rightly so. But we are working as quickly aspossible to put money into yourpockets.
We also know that people abroadare still having trouble findingflights to come back home and wecontinue to work with airlines in order to bring people home.
Yesterday, air transat announcedtwo other flights leaving fromel salvador and guatamala.
Our government is in closecontact with our governmentalpartners who are also facingthis crisis.
We're looking at what has workedfor them and we're trying to seewhether we can take inspirationfrom their success.
I spoke to g20 leaders and onething is clear, we can onlyovercome COVID-19 if we takeaction together as a globalcommunity.
So we're going to do whatever ittakes.
That means making sure that theworld health organization andour public health agencies havethe resources they need.
It means working together todevelop a vaccine, identifytreatments and increase testing.
We're also expandingmanufacturing capacity forcritical medical equipment andworking to keep the supplychains going to get thatequipment to the people who needit.
Our government is helpingcompanies in Canada retool theirmanufacturing facilities toreduce the things we all need.
On the economy, the g20 has alsomade significant investments tohelp people and businesses getthrough this challenging time.
and we're going to be workingclosely together to coordinateour efforts to protect theglobal economy.
COVID-19 is a global crisis anddemands a global response.
Now more than ever, we must workwith our allies to protectpeople and the economy.
and on that note, I announcedthis morning I'm appointingkirsten hillman has our new boarambassador to the United States.
She's a brilliant diplomat andinstrumental in securing a gooddeal for Canada and forcanadians during naftanegotiations.
More recently, ambassadorhillman, played a key role as weworked with our southernneighbours to temporarily closethe border while keeping tradeflowing.
As we fight COVID-19, we mustprotect the supply chains onwhich we depend for things likefresh vegetables, medicine andsupplies for our healthcaresystems.
Our ports are vital to bringingin the things we need and I wantto thank all of the workers whoare keeping our country moving.
Everyday our government looks atwhat we need to do better tohelp you and to keep you safefrom this evolving crisis.
So in response to the fact thattoo many travelers are still notself-isolating upon returning tocanada, we are taking greateraction.
I have been very clear on this.
The premiers, Dr. Tam and publichealth officials have all beenvery clear on this.
If you've just returned fromabroad, you have to go home andstay home for 14 days.
Tout but some people have notbeen taking this seriously.
They're stopping by the grocerystore on their way home from theairport and they're gettingtogether with friends afterbeing away for March break.
This kind of conduct is not justdisappointing, but it'sdangerous.
So now, a 14-day quarantine willbe mandatory for all canadiansreturning home from abroad.
We are implementing thequarantine act to keep allcanadians safe.
If you do not comply with theseinstructions, you could faceserious fines and even prisontime.
(speaking french).



It is absolutely essential that all travelers go into a14-day quarantine when they comeback from travel.
This is a message we've beenrepeating, but some people don'tseem to be taking theserecommendations seriously andthat is not only disappointing.
It's dangerous.
Therefore, we are makingquarantine mandatory by invokingthe quarantine act.
If you refuse to follow theinstructions, you may receive astiff penalty or even be sent toprison.
We all have a role to play inorder to stop the spread of thevirus.
What we're asking you is notdifficult.
Stay home, wash your hands, keepa proper distance from othersand call your friends ratherthan going to see them.
Andespecially if you're come backfrom abroad, under nocircumstances can you leave yourhome for 14 days.
We also all want to see life goback to normal as soon aspossible, but for now, everyonehas to do their share.
Thank you very much.
(speaking french).



Thank you.
(speaking french).



Good morning, Mr. Trudeau, I would like to hear from you.
Can you hear me? I want to hear from you about the 16 tonnes of equipment that has been sent in February fromchina.
Can you explain that decision because it seems that in manyprovinces, they are lacking equipment and in has been sent to china? well, this is a global crisis and it requires a globalresponse.
So helping others is also a way of helping ourselves, but I can reassure Canadians that first, we have been able to meet the needs of the provinces with respect to protective equipment and in the coming days, we will be receiving millions of additional items in medical equipment in order to meet all of the needs that are out there.
and Canadian companies are also manufacturing medical equipment at this time so therefore, we will have the necessary equipment to keep Canadians safe while at the same time doing our part internationally because this is a global crisis.
We recognise from the very beginning that this is a global crisis that requires global cooperation and response if we are to keep all of us safe and if we are to keep canadianssafe.
At the same time, I can assure everyone that the federal stockpiles have been sufficient to meet the needs of the provinces until this point an din the coming days, we will be receiving millions more items that are necessary right across the country at the same time as our businesses, companies and manufactures are tooling up production to make sure that we have enough, not just forcanadians, but for friends an dallies around the world who needit.



Thank you.
(speaking french).



Mr. Trudeau, I would like to come back to your legislation giving taxation and spending powers until December of 2021.
You explained why your government thought that it needed that kind of flexibility to deal with the crisis, but you never explained why you thought you needed it for such a longtime.
Could you please explain the logic of 2021 and do you regretit? as you know, this is an unexpected and unpredictable situation and this is somethingwe've never seen happen incanada or in the global economy.
We know that we need extraordinary measures to respond to this crisis.
We wanted to give the government the necessary flexibility to respond to the crisis because wedon't know how long it couldlast.
and we understood and worked with the opposition parties in order to resolve their concern sand we will continue to ensure that the necessary measures are there for Canadians.
(speaking french)



Thank you.
The next question is from davidingram from Reuters, Ottawa.
Go ahead.
Sorry, David, I need you to raise the volume, I can't hearthem.



is that better? yes, thank you, David.



President trump said yesterday he wanted to reopen the United States economy by Easter.
Mayors in border towns are telling us they're petrified of millions coming north with thevirus.
How concerned are you by hiscomments? and how will you stop this? is there a way to put some security presence on the border? we will continue to work with the United States to ensure that the border measures we put in place are respected.
We have closed the border temporarily to all but essential travelers and we will continue to work with the americanadministration to ensure thatwe're doing everything we can to keep our country safe and to keep Canadians safe in our case.
We will continue to adjust as things unfold, as necessary, but we will be continuing to follow the best advice of the scientific community on doing what is necessary to keepcanadians safe as a priority.
(speaking french).



Thank you.
The last question is from brucesmith from the<I> toronto star</I> . please go ahead.



Prime Minister, good morning.
I'm just wondering why was the quarantine for travelers from outside of the country not made mandatory sooner, before the march travelers came home an dare you worried that this delay may have contributed to the spread of the virus in Canada? right across the country, we'veseen Canadians following theguidelines, taking very seriously the recommendations of public health agencies.
We have seen people staying athome.
We have seen people keeping twometre's distant from each other and we've seen people engaged inhandwashing and using handsanitizer.
We know that the vast voter ofcanadians have been following the guidelines set out for their own protection and for the protection of all of us. Unfortunately, there are an umber of people who have not been following the guidelines that are from for theirprotection, which is why we'vehad to take this next step of bringing in the quarantine act to ensure that Canadians who do not follow the instructions toself-quarantine for 14 days, self-isolate for 14 daysimmediately upon reenteringcanada, they will be facingfines and, perhaps, even jailtime.
(speaking french).



Hi, Ashley Burke, CBC news.
a week and a half ago, you toldcanadians to come home.
More than a million canadianshave since then.
Can you tell me about thedecision-making and therationale behind waiting untilnow, making it mandatory toundergo a 14-day self-quarantinerather than a week and a halfago.
There was a requirement from thevery beginning, instructionsgiving to Canadians returning, that they needed to self-isolatefor 14 days and many, many, manyof them did.
Canadians have been followingthe instructions and the rulesand the guidelines set out bypublic health because they knowit's about protecting their ownsafety, and protecting theintegrity and the health ofpeople who work in ourhealthcare system.
Unfortunately, there have beentoo many people who have not andthat's why we have to take thisfurther step of makingquarantine mandatory andbringing in enforcementmeasures, as well.



One of the challenges is enforcement with this mandatoryquarantine.
Are you asking people to report if they see someone breaking the rules or the law? public health will be following up in many, many cases to ensure that people are following these rules and enforcement with happen as enforcement does in various ways by our police and enforcement officers.
(speaking french).



We recognise that many people will follow these recommendations and healthcanada will be following up with many people to make sure that they are in self-isolation andif people do not comply with theguidelines, then we have seen anumber of cases in the newswhere people have stopped orhave been arrested for notfollowing those recommendations.
Hydro Canada, you're askingcanadians to do their part.
Why not ask the large creditcard companies to give people agrace period.
There are people whose creditcards are maxed up and don't youthink it's time for them to givecanadians a grace period? yes, that is a conversation weare now having with the majorbanks in Canada and I can tellyou that Minister morneau hasbeen in regular discussions withthe banks.
We are encouraging them to takesome measures at this time.
At the same time, we're lookingat taking measures to allowpeople to have credit that wouldcost much less than what iscurrently charged on creditcards.
I can assure you that thefinance Minister has hadconversations directly with thebanks about credit card interestrates and we recognise that theyare a significant challenge formany Canadians at this point.
That is why we are encourage temthem to take action andalleviate the burden forcanadians.
We are looking at making creditmore available and lessexpensive for Canadians to be able to make it through the nextfew months.



Good morning, Prime Minister.
Janet silver, global news.
Global news has learned that the trump administration wants to have United States military troops stationed within 30 kilometers of the canadian-United States border tocut back over fears with regardsto COVID-19 is the illegalborder crossings.
I want to know if you think thisis necessary and if you or anyof your colleagues in yourgovernment had any discussionswith the trump administrationabout this.
Canada and the united stateshave the longest unmilitaryizedborder in the world and it isvery much in both of ourinterests to remain that way andwe have been in discussions withthe United States on this.
(speaking french).



Canada and the united state shave the longest un-militarizedborder in the world and we arein discussion with the United States on that very issue.



I'm with CTV national new sand can you give us more clarity on that? what does this mean for Canada? we have highlighted that the fact that the Canada-United States borderis the longest un-militarizedborder IN the world, somethingthat has benefited our twoeconomies tremendously.
and we feel that it needs toremain this way.



I want to ask about --there's more than 30, 000 cases alone in new York and that's Astarte that borders parts ofontario and Quebec.
Would we ever ban essential goods or people coming in specifically from that hot spot? we will always take measures to protect Canadians as we'vedemonstrated.
At the same time, we understand part of protecting Canadians is ensuring a good supply of food, of medical supplies, of necessary equipment across our border and we will continue to look for ways to make sure we'rekeeping Canadians safe, while providing us with the things we need.



Prime Minister, on your call with the g20 leaders today, was there any discussion or decision made on the call from the u. N. for two billion in aid for developing countries to fight the coronavirus, including help with testing kits in africaand other gear needed? we talked about a number ofthings, about the need for coordinated global response and that is something that the g20is particularly well-suited tomove forward on and we need tomake sure that we're continuingto exchange information andalign in the actions we take.
We talked about the need toflatten the global curve of thispandemic, which means beyondjust individual countries doingwhat's necessary for themselves, we need to work together to havean impact that goes beyond ourborders.
We talked about the need forglobal economic support, forcitizens, for businesses.
The g20 represents 85% of theglobal gdp and we know that wehave the capacity to stave offand to positively impact theeconomy at this time ofsignificant stress and so, wepledge to work together and wealso talked about the need helpvulnerable countries that don'thave either the science or thehealth systems to be able tokeep their populations safe, including through investmentsthrough world globalorganizations like the u. N. orthe W.H.O. OR the world bank.
We also specifically talkedabout the challenges facingafrica and how we will be thereto support africa as they facethis pandemic, as well.



So does that mean -- the question was, is Canada and other countries sending money and additionally, Saudi Arabia's the chair of the g20, did the price war over oil prices come up and what's happening there? as I spoke about yesterday, we will be participating in international efforts to fight this virus.
We know that support for vulnerable countries who are struggling with the ability to combat this virus is not just about being altruistic but providing Canadians as well.
This may face resurgences once we have handled it in Canada an dour ability to minimize those resurgences will be linked to our ability to help and work with countries in more diresituations.
(speaking french).



We recognize that participating in global aid to combat COVID-19 is not just question of altruism.
It's a question of doing the right thing for Canadians.
We know that preventing any resurgence of the virus in several months, once we have controlled it in Canada, will require concrete action invulnerable countries right now.
and that's why we want to participate in the u. N.'sefforts to help those countries in distress.
(speaking french).



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada giving us his daily update from his home, Rideau cottage, here in thenation's capital.
His self-isolation is officiallyover but we don't know whetherhe will be working from home orcoming into the office from timeto time or what the next stepsare, but that's what we havebeen told.
So a few bits of news there fromthe Prime Minister.
The main message, really, reiterating the benefit that isnow going to be available tocanadians, the emergencybenefit.
and that that portal will soonbe open and many of you affectedby the pandemic.
But little bits of news, too, that we want to get to with mycolleagues.
Vassy, I'll start with you andcloser to the end.
There's been a global newsreport that the United States iscontemplating sending troops toits northern borders so betweencanada is the United States it sounded to me like the Prime Minister had thoseconversations?



**Vassy**:

It sounded like he essentially confirmed the report and emphasized his way of, iguess, characterizing the discussions so far with that.
Right now Canada and the United States share the largest demilitarized border and it's their desire to keep it that way.
That does confirm those discussions are taking place and it does present, I guess, aw hole new host of complexities for this government to deal with when it comes to that border right now and the relationship with the United States.
We had just, prior to this pressconference, talking about whether Canada would take more aggressive measures about reopening about the economy and the Prime Minister was asked about that, as well, andrefrained, again, from saying more aggressive measures were even being considered.
Instead, he highlighted the integration of the twoeconomies, the relationship, rather, between the twocountries, something he did again when answering the question about the possibility of the border being militarized.
I think it will be interesting to find out to what degree is the United States doing so and it had todo with people crossing in between points of entry.
My understanding last week, the number had decreased a bit.
Though, there were people as part of the agreement to restrict the order made an agreement to turn anyone back.
That was a major shift inpolicy, too, because we had been taking people who were walking in between those official points of entry and they were going through the asylum system in this country.
So that agreement essentially made it so they would be turned back to the United States, should they do that.
So curious to find out what the justification is for needing greater military presence, especially one that happens to be -- would it take the form, for example, of boots on theground, or using drones or air surveillance or things of thatnature.



**Rosemary**:

Let me turn tocatherine cull networks.
En. Today the message is much clearer from the prime minister in terms of why they're doing this and what the expectationis.



Saying again and again many people have been following therules, but a significant enough number haven't that they felt they needed to enact this.
We heard he should have given people that opportunity not to follow the rules and we've been reporting on CBC news, forexample, RVs lined up in bordertowns, coming across from the border that all of these people stopped at a Walmart to get groceries and supplies.
The government is saying this is not what we want to see and talking about the consequences, fines of up to $750, 000, time in jail if you're endangeringsomeone's life.
He was asked, are you encouraging Canadians to report on one another? he said public health will be doing the followup and we know from Vassy's interview yesterday that the Minister said theydon't have the resources to check up on everybody all of thetime.
This will be spot checks and it will be randomized.
But he said enforcement will happen whether through police officers or other enforcementofficers.
It's interesting to note, we were speaking to the nova scotiarcmp because, of course, novascotia is asking anyone who has coming from out of province, crossing into the provisionalboundaries, you have toself-isolate for 14 day.
Police there say they haven'tissued a ticket yet and this hasbeen going on since Sunday.
They're trying to educatepeople.
This is not just about bordercrossing but social distancing, as well.
One of the questions in all ofthe of this will be, how will itbe enforced and how aggressivelywill it be enforced? the message is go home, stayhome, do not pass go.



**Rosemary**:

There are people ratting out their neighbours.
There was a story this morning on the radio, a gathering across the river in gatineau.
I guess a neighbour called and there were six people in an apartment and police came, they were fined for the noise and fined for the gathering.
It's not like it's not happening and that authorities won'tenforce as needed.
I'll put you two on pause for amoment.
This issue of people coming across the border, coming back into the country and notself-isolating for 14 days, thatisn't working and dave segulinshas been digging into this andfound people not being upfrontand getting on flights, even, ifthey're trying to get back home.



**Reporter**:

Well, I've been looking specifically into the air flight regulations and the government is prepared to take mandatory legal measures to quarantine people once they arrive here, but the measures before you get on the airplane, when you're abroad and trying to get back to Canada, those arevoluntary.
It's an honour system and people are cheating it and you can kind of understand why.
We're this the middle of global pandemic.
People are growing desperate and if they have symptoms and aresick, ill, you're away fromfamily, you're away fromcanadian healthcare and you'reprobably in a part of the world that isn't your comfort zone and you want to get back.
If you're faced with only flee equestions, do you have fever, sore throat, we're learning people are tempted to be dishonest and come back.
But that's creating a host of other problems.
It was interesting in the lack of answer to this issue from the prime Minister today becausethey're not willing to take any sort of mandatory measures, no testing for fevers or physical tests that would screen passengers before they get on the planes.
and we're hearing from flight attendants and passengers aboard those planes very worried about people with extreme symptoms who are on flights that they are being exposed on those aircraft.
and we're learning, also, that air flight attendants, some are now contracting COVID-19. We assume some of that exposure is at work.
So it's a complex set of issues, but right now, the advice from the Prime Minister is, don't get on a flight, but there is nothing really preventing people from keeping their symptomshidden.



**Rosemary**:

When they gethere, they will have to be under quarantine and that will somehow be monitored and enforced and allot to expect from the airlinesthemselves, who have to do thesetests.
Thank you.
I think we actually have, before go to Dr. Peter Lin, I think we have the declaration that you will have to agree to when you come back into this country, because it does look slightly different than if you have been through customs or across the border lately.
This is what it says now.
I acknowledge that we mustself-isolate for 14 days toprevent the potential spread ofcovid-19. So you acknowledge that and, obviously, they're taking yourinformation down.
If there are going to be spotchecks by public healthofficials, even just calls tosee where you are, that is thebeginning of that enforcement.
Let me bring in Dr. Peter lin intoronto.
Dr. Lin, obviously, there isconcern, based on what dave hasbeen reporting and the otherstories we're hearing aboutsnowbirds, for instance, comingback across the border and goingabout their errands before theygo home.
Do you think that the threat ofserious fines is going to changeanything?



Hopefully it will when people hear that.
But more importantly, their family and friends will be telling them, don't go here andthey're. We're hoping we don't need to use the police force and thercmp, that we could use socialpressure.
In other words, your family and friends will do that.
When I was looking at theflights, all of the asiaflights, everybody has a maskson.
We're saying the masks are notgood, not good but, perhaps, now, we redistribute masks in this particular situation.
Not normal flights but maybe this will make people feel better and less likely totransmit.
We know in the early stages of the disease, I would lie, too.
If I am trying to come backhome, I would get on thatflight.
But if we have on masks, wewon't breathe on the nextperson.
In the early days, you can just be breathing out the virus as you have enough in your body.
If we put on masks, we can decrease it, tell everybody to get home, six feet apart and no gathering and that's why there'sno gathering.
You can't tell a sick person anymore.
We used to think it's sneezing and coughing, but we have normal people breathing out and ifyou're close to them, that's howyou'll pick up the virus.
So perhaps now, masks on planes would be another step to put in place and, perhaps, we who put it in now than a week from now.
So we're always playing a little bit of catch-up, but it'sdifficult because you don't wantto scare people or have to putin all of these rules.
But maybe we who put in thoserules now.



**Rosemary**:

Asking someone to wear a mask is not a heavy lift or a big requirement if you want to get on a plane.
Dr. Lin, I'll leave it there fortoday.
Thank you and always great to have you.
As we wait for health officials to join us for the noonbriefing, let me give you more information around what we were discussing with Catherine andvassy and what the Prime Minister was asked about.
We can confirm, indeed, thatcanada is aware that the United States is considering moving about 1, 000 troops to theborder.
They would be stationed about 2rand they would use general kind of sensors to look out for irregular border crossers.
The original border crosses are sent back to the United States and there was a day last week when the highest number of bordercrossers was 17. It's unclear why you would need to patrol the border for such allow number, but we'll try to get more answers to that at this upcoming press conference.
Before we do that, though, want to go back to a canadianwho we had on at some point over the last number of days.
I'm not sure what day it was.
It was a Canadian stuck in peruwho still wants to come home.
We've been speaking regularly with Greg bestross, stuck in hospital in Peru.
I know things have actually gotten worse for you and tell me what the situation is now.



So today is day 11 of our time spent on lock-down here, atthe hotel, and yesterday morningwe received information thatsomebody in our hospital didtest positive for COVID-19. As per direction of the ministryof health of peru, the hospitalhas informed us we will belocked down here for a durationof one to three months.



**Rosemary**:

and what, ifanything, have you been able to get in terms of information from the Canadian government?



So the difficulty is, as youknow, I think there is, obviously, a very high volume ofcalls, of people looking to reach out to us, people looking out to various numbers provided, be it local here in Peru or back home in Ottawa.
At this point, we have not heard back from anyone.
I've attempted to leave multiple messages and I've attempted to get ah old of people because three days ago, we were informed they were bringing a doctor into this hospital to test two people and pending the results, we would be locked down here for 28days.
At that point in time, we we retold there was no way we allowed to leave the hospital in themeantime.
So once the results came backpositive, the manager of the hospital had held a meeting and informed us of the circumstance sand basically told us we would be locked down for one to threemonths.
I have preemptively tried to get this information out to ourgovernment, to see what kind of intervention could have happened prior to something like thishappening.
My fiance and myself, evacueewe'vetaken the precaution to iseourselves and I wish that action had come swifter because we'rein a situation that I don't know if we will be able to make ithome.



**Rosemary**:

There's been one flight out of Lima, Peru and idon't know if you've had those updates and if you respond.



Yeah, I checked on twitter this morning.
I've been up every morning 5:30, 6:00 a. M. to see if there's any information made available.
This morning, the Twitter page did inform the masses that they are going to have a flight fromcusco to Lima tomorrow.
Yesterday, they had filled up tickets for a flight directly from Lima that will be leaving later on this afternoon.
My fear is that we are locked down there this hotel now and wedon't believe we'll be able to even take advantage of the chance of getting on that flight from Cuzco to Lima because of the fact that this has been placed in a military quarantine.



**Rosemary**:

If you left what would happen or if you tried toleave, what would happen?



We've been told if we do not cooperate with the quarantine, we will go to jail for five to ten years here in Peru.



**Rosemary**:

Can I ask you, know you went down for a wedding and I know Peru wasn't on the list of countries at the time but I know the world was seeing this pandemic spread.
Do you know regret going there and taking this -- I guess it was a bit of a gamble, right? do you regret that?



I mean, hindsight is always20/20 and I look back act the aedecisions and would we do thingsdifferently? absolutely.
We went on the advice of our government which told us there was no need to worry, Peru was safe place and at the time wearrived, there were four cases in Peru and it didn't seem like the current situation we'restuck in. I don't think anyone could have predicted the borders closing in24 hours or have predicted the very quick reaction that theperu government put in place to allow for foreign citizens to get home.
Absolutely, would we do thingsdifferently? absolutely.
But at this point, we're left in this situation.
We've checked emails and filled out forms and waited for something to happen and our worst fear has seem to come to light now.



**Rosemary**:

I'll hope that government officials are watching and listening, but they made it clear that not everyone will get home.
So if you're not going get home, are you prepared and how will you stay there for a month ormore?



I mean, at this point, itdoesn't seem like we have very much of a choice.
I've seen the toll that this situation has taken on our mental health.
I've seen the anxiety attacks that have happened with my fiance and I'm generally worried for our mental health and now knowing there's positive cases in this place that we'restaying, I'm worried for my physical health.
I've done everything I can do to mitigate any risk.
We've only left our room to use the washroom and grab food and come back.
There's been no socialinteraction.
This has not been a vacation.
This is us sitting on our phones for 12 to 15 hours a day, waiting for some response, waiting for some action and thecanadian government told us to stay put, abide by local lawenforcement.
You can't go on the street so much as to grab something from the supermarket without having somebody from the military or police stop you.
You can imagine what that looks like when you're looking to potentially change the lodging that you're staying at. There has not been the option to check out and to leave unless we were leaving to go home.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Greg, thanks again for talking to us and know that -- I'm sure people were listening, people ingovernment, as well, and listen, I wish you the best and the veryleast, good health as this goes on and please keep us posted Astor what's happening.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

As we stand by now to bring you the noon update, the regular noon update from cabinet ministers and public health officials, let's me bring you up to date out of the latest numbers out of Ontario today, now up to 858 cases and that'sup 170 cases, which is the largest single day increase in this province.
(please stand by). and that is our daily coverage of the pandemic update.
We are going to sign off fromcbc television and you can continue watching, though, on"cbc news network" and cbc.
Ca. I'm rosemary barton here inottawa.
Thank you for watching.



-- that Canada in particularwould want to see happen, but we have a little bit more details on that.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, we do have a bit more detail on that.
The Prime Minister was asked very directly, as you mentioned, rosy, whether or not those discussions are taking place, and he confirmed that, yes, the discussions are takingplace.
While you were interviewing our friend in Peru, I was calling, trying to find out whether this would start.
Because if the United States wants to do this to address the issue that people have been crossing in between checkpoints, those numbers dwindled prior to last week when an agreement between the United States and Canada came into effect that would restrict the flow of those border crossers.
So instead of being able to cross between those checkpoints, and then be processed through the asylum system, the process that came into effect last Friday, they would be denied and would be sent back to the United States.
The reasoning behind these discussions is interesting.
I could not get a clear answer yet on sort of when they began.
How does the agreement that was arrived at between the United States and Canada factor into that? what I am told that deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has been briefed on the incident, and we should get some sort of timing or instigation about this.



As you say, the numbers, last week, they were 47, 45 -- frankly, the concern would actually be for us rather than the United States, given the way their numbers on COVID-19 are sort of spiralling out, particularly as you talked about in the state of new York.
It seems sort of curious that the United States would want to put patrols along the border, given that they are in a much worse situation.
But I don't pretend to understand the logic here in any way.
Okay.
I'll go to Catherine Cullen.
Feel free to weigh-in on that.
But in part, the quarantine effect is coming through the United States, where the numbers are much higher, and the virus is much less contained.



Yeah.
I could want to touch on that for a second.
The other question I think we would have is why people leaving the United States would be such a great concern for the United states if this decision is seen as being part of the response of COVID-19. Certainly, people crossing the border in Canada a big concern, but why would the United States administration be worried about people who are outgoing? still getting a lot of information about the man in quarantine.
You will be faced with these questioned if you cross at a land border.
If you're driving yourself home, so if you're driving across the border, if you're driving from the airport, certainly, leaving the airport, the question is, do you have symptoms or not? but if you're driving yourself across the border, all indications that we have, it's fine, but don't make stops along the way.
If you're driving home, do you have symptoms? something we need to touch on, earlier, when the Prime Minister was making his remark sand addressing Canadians, they'll have the benefit of within 14 days, the portal will be up and running.
I know there's a lot of people following this very closely, wondering when they're going to have money in their pockets.



Can I jump in for a quick second?



Yes.



**Vassy**:

I just want to say that after that, the Prime Minister was misspeaking.
It's still going to be ten days.



Yeah.
He's working long hours, so it's -- a matter of four days is a big deal for a lot of people, so important to know that the target is -- the target, any ways, is still ten days after you get that process.
The Prime Minister did confirm today that Kirsten hill man has become Canada's new ambassador in Washington, which is probably well timed, given these reports that we're hearing coming out.
Ambassador hill man has been a factor in the negotiation of the new NAFTA between Canada, the United States, and Mexico at a time when, obviously, the ongoing issues, whether it be from an ongoing health perspective or an economic perspective between the Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
I think I'm going to play a clip -- can I play a clip? the Prime Minister is going to make sure the border doesn't thicken in the midst of this.
There was a lot of effort to shutdown nonessential travel between the United States and Canada, but to keep trade moving prettyfreely.
and any concern by the United States to move to thicken that border would be worrisome for the government.
Let me play this clip for you awhile ago Prime Minister Prime Minister --



That is the Prime Minister weighing in on that.
The deputy Prime Minister has been in charge of this file since, really, the first election in 2015.
I'm not even sure in what way this would help this measure, that the United States is at least contemplating, Vassy.
I don't know if you can wrap your head around that.
I'm not sure why it would be needed or what it would actually do.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, and I guess to take the question one step further, rosy, that's what I was asking when I was calling, is there a reason to take that beyond this? is the president interested in remilitaryizing the border beyond the Prime Minister said so? there have been points at which the issue of border crosses has been a big one, there's been thousands of them transversing.
There's a -- traversing.
It's been a big political issue, but at this point, it just doesn't add up. is there a desire to see the re militarization of the border like they have on the southern border.
The United States president always has said he treats the two borders the same.
On the face of it right now, the justification provided by the white house doesn't seem to match up with the reality, and I know that's a statement that could match up in other instances, as well, but despitethat, the unpredictability of this white house has been pretty strong.
It is curious to see, and I think where Minister Freeland is concerned, I would like to see where the discussions began.
Have the United States floated other justifications beyond border crossers, and did sort of the agreement that was reached last week, does that influence or impact the direction of these discussions at all? I think there are so many question marks right now about why this is happening, and all we know is that it is.



We do know, too, that sometimes past experiences get floated out there by the United States, and then Canada spends days and days and days talking the United States offer the ledge, and then, they dial it back.
I imagine that seems to be the conversation now, but again, we'll hear from the deputy Prime Minister.



> again, the Prime Minister was talking about relief available for many Canadians.
Portal is not open on the website, but essentially, it allows you about $2, 000 per month if your employment has been affected in any way but the pandemic if you have to look after your kids.
So lots of different criteria that has been put out to you.
So lots of people are out of jobs, having to watch their kids during this time.
Joining us is a renter in the city, and you recently lost one of your jobs.
Tell me some more.



Well, actually, three jobs.
One of the jobs, I used to be an usher at Massey hall, and I was laid off due to renovations, and obviously, with all of this going on, who knows when that's coming back.
My main employment is I work as a yoga instructor, meditation instructor, and with all the self-isolation, that whole business is now an on-line business.
It's a lot of changes for everybody, and it's quite challenging, actually, to work with.
My third job is in retail, and right now, we were just sent home, so I'm not working at allright now.



You're normally a pretty busy guy, it sounds like.



Yes.



The rent payment is coming up the first of the month.
I don't know if you'd want to give me a sense of what you pay or if you're going to be able to do it this month.



Well, I'm not going to be able to do it this month because I'm making sure that our gas tanks are filled, we have groceries that we need.
Fortunately, the landlord reached out to us yesterday to find out if everything's okay and if there's a chance that we would be able to make payment and if not, what sort of adjustments we can make? so we're sort of waiting to find out what the Prime Minister had to say about all the various things allowable to the community.



So this emergency benefit, it sounds to me like you probably could make a case to it, getting access to it, so if you get closer to April, and it's $2, 000 a month, how would that help? would that help you?



I think it would, with the rent and other things that are coming through, but again, we're going through that scenario where we're sort of living check to checks and without any sense of going back to work, we're basically reliant on how this plays out.
I'm very thankful for it. I think it's a great step in the right direction, and I do consider myself fortunate, but I know there's less fortunate people, whether they don't have home or -- there's so many different things at play.



Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced a freeze on rent, a freeze on evictions.
But he also says round the housuare trying to self-isolate, andi imagine that makes it all a little more difficult.



Well, you know, as a weird twist of fate, it's been great because as you've stated, I've kept a pretty busy lifestyle.
These past couple of weeks have been great because I have a lot of time to spend with him.
It gives My partner Lisa more time to do the things that she needs to do instead of being a caregiver 24-7 because when I come home, I am so tired.
I am looking for the silver lining in all of this, and hopefully, we get through this in the best way possible.



So let me just leave on this.
How stressed out or worried are you about money and paying or making all your bills at this stage?



Well, that's a great question.
and I will say, I'm lucky.
I have a practice based in yoga and meditation, so My whole thing is how to deal with stress.
But that being said, it's on my mind a lot.
I'm up till the wee hours in the morning, figuring out how we're going to make it and keep my family safe.
Going to the grocery store, it's tough, going there, and coming home, sanitizing your food and everything.
and having a toddler, you don'twant to transmit anything to this little boy who's so innocent and happy all the time.



Well, I wish I had your medimedi -- meditative skills at a time like this.
Go ahead.



Yeah.
I was going to say there's been lot of yoga instructors in this country that have been supporting the community on-line.
So what I would like to see is visit your yoga studio on-line, see what you can do to help.
Yoga and meditation is free foreverybody, let's use this as anopportunity to discuss what it can do for us.



Well, I'm glad you're taking everything in stride and that you're getting the information you need.
If you don't, reach out to us, and we'll get it to you.



Thank you.



Take care, and have a nice day.



Namaste.



I know that the finance Minister, for instance, has talked about how banks are supposed to allow you some flexibility now in mortgage payments.
If you're a renter, you're in different boat entirely, and you're pretty much dependent in being able to use the payments that you get from the government or having a flexiblelandlord.



> I'm sure that's a story that you've heard a few times before, people that are probably not going to be able to pay rent in about a week's time.
Tell me what you're hearing from people?



Yeah.
We're definitely hearing from allot of investors and landlords.
Of course, everyone's mindful of what's going on, so both landlords and commercial tenants, residential tenants, they're all working with them to come up with a plan to get through the next few months.



John, I'm going to leave you -- I'm sure what you're saying is super interesting, but our technology is failing us a little bit.
This is the problem when we're doing so many remote interviews.
We'll come back to you because it's so hard to understand you.
I'm going to go back to My guests because they're waiting for the press conference, along with me.



> you hear about the financial help, there are so many people that need it, and need it fast.



**Vassy**:

Go ahead, Catherine.



Well thing that we didn't touch on after Prime Minister'sconference was the question he was asked about credit cards and a credit card grace period.
We've heard, getting these smoke signals from the government about that they're talking about credit to help not only businesses but to helpindividuals.
The government said listen, we've proposed that to the banks.
We want to see that happen.
You can imagine that a lot of people who are worried about paying rent are interested.



Yeah.
Coaxing the bank doesn't always work -- okay.
I'm going to go to deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland who's leading the press conference.



a daily reminder to all Canadians.
We must all practice physical distancing.



> today, the Prime Minister announced Kirsten hill man as ambassador to the United States.
I have worked with Kirsten since 2015, and I know that as we battle COVID-19 and have so much work to do with the United States on so many different issues, Kirsten is exactly the right woman to almost doubled in Newfoundland yesterday.



As well, increased laboratory capacity, and the ability of laboratory hospitals to confirm cases contributed TA sharp spike in Quebec this week.
Cases are related to a range of exposures and travelers related to March break in Quebec, to a large funeral that almost doubled newfoundland's case count yesterday.
We are now seeing a snap shot of COVID-19 in Canada, where 6%of all cases require hospitalization, and 2.6% of all cases are critically ill, and 1% of cases have been fatal.
The fact that Canada's fatality rate is at 1% indicates that the health care system is not currently overwhelmed, but these fatalities could be reduced further by preventing illness in our most vulnerable populations.
Many of the deaths in Canada have been linked to outbreaks and clusters in our provinces.
The seriousness of this disease cannot be overstated.
Older adults and adults with serious medical conditions are at risk.
But not only can people of all ages get can he veerly ill, but -- severely ill, but it will impact all.
Anyone affected by the seriousness of COVID-19 and the need for physical distancing should look to countries like Italy and the fact of a health system severely overwhelmed.
So by keeping a distance between yourselves, you are helping everyone.



Okay.
Now we're going to hear from our Minister of employment, disability, and workforce development.



Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the a. L.s. and l. S.q. Sign language interpreters, who havebeen working hard to provide simultaneous translations during these press conferences, so all Canadians can stay informed.
Thank you.
Your work is hard, and we appreciate it. Over the past few weeks, we've all been asked to work togetherto stop the spread of COVID-19. I know this has come with a lotof uncertainty, anxiety, and concern, especially the part about not being able to pay your check.



The legislation enacted yesterday is the first step to help with some of the stress by implementing special measures to support Canadians who are struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic.



So effect help, we've introduced the emergency response benefit.
From the very beginning, we wanted to help all workers, whether or not they were eligibility for e. I. we took active action in the e. I. by waiving the six-week benefits, and then, an unprecedented wave of e. I. applications came rolling in, and then, it became clear therewas uncertainty and confusion around which benefit to apply for.
At that point, it became obvious that we had to simplifythe existing benefits by merging them into a single temporary emergency benefit foreveryone.



Our e. I. system was not designed to address a global pandemic situation.
It doesn't help all workers, and it doesn't contemplate the myriad of situations that workers are facing during this crisis with its significant economic impacts.
It's clear we need an emergency impact outside of existing government programme parametresto respond to this emergency situation.
That's what the Canada emergency response benefit is. Retroactive to March 15, Canadian workers will have access to the CERB to a maximum of 16 weeks if their income loss is related to COVID-19. It's a stream lined benefit with a straightforward eligibility criteria.
The portal for accessing the emergency response benefit will be open in early April, and until then, Canadians can continue to apply for e. I. on-line and will automatically be enrolled in the CERB.
We're truly doing everything inour power to help Canadians andprotect them against this virusand its economic impacts.
We'll continue to work togetherto find ways to support canadian workers and their families.
Merci.
Thank you.



Okay.
Thank you, C.R.A.



> and now, I give the floor to the vice president of the treasury board.



Thank you, Chrystia.
The main message today is information and support, and being clear on the instructions that we all must follow in social distancing, but also the clear directives issued yesterday when the quarantine act was invoked to ensure that everyone who comes back to Canada self-isolates for at least 15 days under proper conditions, otherwise, the quarantine will not come into effect.
We have created the Canada emergency response benefit.
It is more simple, it'll be quicker.
It's more inclusive, as well.
It is generous, it is $2, 000 a month for the next four months, and that's because we want to avoid having a break in the employment length between employers and employees.
Now we want to ensure that whenthe economy comes back on-line, people will be able to pay their workers quickly.



Thank you.
and of course, with us also is patty hajdu, our deputy of public health, and our Minister, please.



So we are going to take three questions on the phone.



Thank you.
Merci.
Please press star-one on the phone if you have a question.
There will be a brief moment while the participants register.
Thank you for your patience.
[speaking french language]
