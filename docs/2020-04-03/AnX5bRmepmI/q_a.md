Our first question is from MIA Robson of the Canadian press.



Hi. I'm wondering if you can talk about a little bit about how the quarantine for people coming back to Canada would be enforced, the measures that you'll actually take and how that will be enforced.



Okay.
Patty can answer that.



Well, first, I'll take this opportunity to thank our colleagues at the Canadian border services to put in place the measures that will help us enforce the quarantine act measure that we announced yesterday.
Ultimately, what we are doing is reminding these Canadians --and these are Canadians in the minority, I will say who are not taking the need to self-isolate seriously.



So I'm just going to take people back a little bit in imagining when you enter the international border into Canada.
So any symptomatic people will be immediately given an order to isolate.
If they can get in a private vehicle to get home, we'll check on them.
If they can't get home, we're, of course, putting them in a federal quarantine place.
We're also taking them to a risk assessment, as well.
So if you're living with someone who happens to be older or with underlying medical conditions, that, of course, will be taking that into account so we can consider themseparately.
We have contact with them, we follow them so that we have a seamless process with local health authorities.
For asymptomatic travelers, they can move on as fast as possible to their home, essentially, their place of residence in Canada.
They are given the order which specifies the kind of consequences and the penalties that you may encounter if you did not follow the order.
They are allowed to go home.
They're asymptomatic, and they're asked to self-isolate, and we're doing random checks as that is felt to be the most reasonable approach.
We'll also work with public health.
They have orders in place, as well, for self-isolation.
So this is a coordinated effort.
So if, for whatever reason, someone is not complying, we can then collaborate with localhealth authorities in the follow-up process.



Follow up?



**Caller**:

Yeah, just to followup on that.
Do you have any number of Canadians that are in the -- I don't want to call it the forced quarantine, but in the federal quarantine places? how many Canadians are being held in the federal quarantine places? and are there anything people can help with so called snitch lines, calling police? what can people do in terms of other people not following the order?



In terms of people at the federal facility, these are very dynamic numbers.
They're very few at this point.
For example, we do have someone who is sick in the Vancouver facility.
We had an example of a couple that went across the land border with Quebec.
They were not ill, but they were living with someone that was immunocompromised.
We had a truck driver, as well, so that was someone who was immediately put into isolation.
These are people that maintain our essential services, but if they are sick, we are making sure that they do not impact the health of Canadians.
They are right now very, very few people, and some of these might already be -- you know, once we are sure that we can safely move onto their homes with the help of public health, we will then depart, so it's a very dynamic number.
and your second question, so I think overall, though, I have to say that Canadians are very collaborative.
This quarantine act is to layer on an additional requirement ofself-isolation.
That is the purpose.
Of course, if there are violations, we're working with local public health authorities.
We're working very closely withthem to find anyone who may be violating the order.
With those random checks, we are, of course, from our end, checking on people who might also not be following the order.
But as the Minister said, we are rapidly setting all of this.



Thank you, Minister.



**Caller**:

Yes, hello.
I would like to follow up on those random checks.
How will they be conducted? will they be done in person or over the phone and if they're done over the phone, how will it be possible to know if they're complying or not?



We are going to get the necessary information about travelers arriving in Canada, it's not everyone, but it's a section of people, and we will work closely with department ofhealth.
There's a range of options.
Someone might go to the person's home, but there are other options, as well, that we're examining because the context is different, depending on the province or territory.



**Caller**:

I just want to know, for people who are coming back to Canada, they don't necessarily live in the same city where their plane has landed.
I think there were talks about organizing transportation for people who don't have their cars or their own personal C.R.A. the airport.
Have you sorted that out? how is it going to work, and where can people call to get that service?



Thank you for the question.
The transportation is for symptomatic passengers so they're not in contact with other passengers in Canadian transit that would obviously beat risk because of their potential infection with COVID-19. As the doctor has illustrated, asymptomatic passengers are given public health advice, including the order to quarantine when they get to their final destination, along with a mask, and told to don the mask if they should get ill at any point along their travel.



But if they don't arrive in their home city, how do they dothat?



The same way that all other passengers are traveling.
They would get onto their next flight or whatever form of transportation is taking them to their final destination, and this would only be allowed if they are asymptomatic.
If they are symptomatic, they would be transported by one of our officials and placed into quarantine until it was determined that they are safe to travel onwards.



Just to be clear, the medical association has contracted transports, so depending on the situation, the ill passengers may either be transferred to a federal quarantine site so if it's within a medical transportationdistance, we would actually drive them all the way home.



Yes.
The next question on the phone.



The next question is from Alex from the Toronto star.
Please go ahead.



**Caller**:

Hi. Thanks for taking My question.
I think this one might be for the deputy Prime Minister.
Just what -- can you tell us anything more about the discussions with the Americans? there's this news report that they're contemplating putting troops at the border.
Just what exactly they're thinking about doing, and what our response is to that?



Thank you for the question, Alex, and the Prime Minister did address that in his Daley press event this morning.
I think for details of what theamericans are considering, the people to ask are the Americans, and the United States, of course, is a sovereign country, which does, as it ought to do, make its own independent decisions about what to do within its own borders.
Having said that, we -- let me share with Canadians what Canadian politicians, ministers, have been expressing very forcefully, what our diplomates, including our newly-appointed ambassador, ambassador hillman, has been saying about this proposal.
and that is Canadians and americans are rightly proud to share the world's longest unmilitaryized border.
This is an important example ofhow our countries very effectively work together.
It is also the case that canadaand the United States are very close military allies.
We are partners in norad, defending our continent, and weare partners in nato.
We have been working very effectively together in our economic relationship.
Witnessed the ratification, even in these difficult times, in the new nafta.
and last week, we managed, working together, a very good reciprocal and cooperative agreement on restricting nonessential travel on our border, across our shared border.
In view of all of these connections, and the importanceof the relationship, Canada is strongly opposed to this United States proposal, and we have made thatopposition very, very clear foramerican counterparts, and we will continue to do so. At the end of the day, every country takes its own decisions, but ours is an important and valued partnership, and we are making very clear Canada's position.
Thanks.



Alex, one follow up?



**Caller**:

Yeah, thanks for that.
and just expanding on that, we're seeing around the world, travel restrictions, border shutdowns, you know, countries sort of scrambling for supplies.
Are you worried that the pandemic will sort of prompt a turn inwards? will it increase consumer protectionism or cause countries to turn away from international cooperation?



Absolutely.
When it comes to protectionism, I think we are already seeing that.
I think we have to be thoughtful about the reaction.
On one hand, every country in this time when we are facing real danger to the health and safety of our citizens, every country needs to focus on the health and safety of its own people, and that is what our government is doing.
and we do that with no apology, in fact, with real conviction.
Having said that -- and I thinkdr.
Tam has been very effective at communicating this -- at the end of the day, the reality of a global pandemic is that it isglobal.
and the long-term lesson that we should be learning from all of this is how important international cooperation is. Now, the lesson that we are being taught is that none of us in the world can be safe and healthy unless we are working hard to be sure that everyone in the world is safe and healthy, and that's why international cooperation is really important.
Canada has been a country that, from the insept of the rules based international order -- incept of the rules-based international order has been anexample for all of us. The Prime Minister today participated in a call of g-20 leaders, and that's an example of his leadership in the international response.
Thank you.



Thank you, Minister.
We'll turn to the phone for three questions, starting with mike from global.



**Caller**:

Thank you.
Minister hajdu, the Prime Minister said millions of P.P.E. is coming into Canada.
Where is it coming from?



Well, thank you for the question.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam for some detailed level discussion.
Some of it is coming from china, some of it is coming from other sources.
As you know, we have domestic sources that we're trying to procure from, as well.
and I think to the deputy Prime Minister's last comment, I reflect on the fact that this is a global pandemic, and I think another thing that I focus on is the fragility of our delivery systems.
and when one country is the only country that can supply those goods, it puts our system and situation somewhat at a disadvantage.
I am extremely proud of the collaborative efforts that are happening across government and with provinces and territories to ensure that we can procure what we need.
We're making progress on the file.
is it perfect? no, but certainly, I think we're getting a lot further in the last week or two than we have been in a while.



**Caller**:

So this is on top of the -- china sent us last month about 16 tonnes of equipment, right? that's what I have here.
is this on top of that, or is that number totally crazy?



I'm sorry.
What was the question at the beginning?



**Caller**:

Can you confirm that china is sending back more equipment than the 16 tonnes last month?



I'll have to get back to you on that unless Dr. Tam has details.
Weal have to get back to you on that.
But I will say I'm proud how hard manufacturers across the globe are working to increase their production.
I, too, have regular calls with my counterparts, g20 counterparts, and the question of personal protective equipment and other supplies was of paramount importance.
I will say the efforts that are happening on domestic production and other continent sis very inspiring.



Julia, CBC.



You say you don't like what the proposal is for the United States can you just tell us what the proposal is, and what you can do about it.



Again, the specifics of what the United States decides to do within its own borders is traditionally a question that is rightly posed to American leaders, and I think that it would be inappropriate for anyone other than United States leaders to comment on what they are contemplating.
In terms of what we're doing about it, we are very directly and very forcefully expressing the view I shared a moment ago, which is that in Canada's view, this is an entirely unnecessary step which we would view as damaging to our relationship.
I would like to thank Minister Blair for speaking to his counterpart about this, and Minister sajjan for speaking to his counterpart about this.
Having said that, this is our neighbour having the right to do what they choose to do on their border.
I will say this is something that we've been in very close contact with our American counterparts with at the local level, at the government level that Canada is taking when it comes to public health here in Canada.
Thanks.



**>> Reporter**:

Okay.
I'm not sure if it's a question for patty hajdu or Theresa Tam, but we're hearing attendants are getting sick on flights because they're passengers that they have to deal with.
is there anything being done to stop this?



I'll answer this, and then, I'll turn to Dr. Tam.
We've turned to industry sector guidelines to care for employees in that sector that can help them -- prevent them from acquiring COVID-19. We know that there are a variety of front line workers, including retail workers that are experiencing a higher degree of contact with workers.
We continue to refine that sector and guidance as we uncover various sectors of their work, and I will turn to Dr. Tam for more comment on that.



So we provide guidance to different sectors and have been engaging with airlines on an ongoing basis.
Some of the current measures being put in place, for example, ensuring those sick passengers get on the plane, of course also protects the crew that's on the plane and ensuring the people have the right equipment -- for example, putting a mask on someone that's sick and trying to separate them.
Increasing environmental cleaning and procedures like that, providing advice to -- and ensure that the aircraft is -- is cleaned and safe, as well.
So of course anyone arriving incanada who is ill will be taken care of, as with other travelers, as well.
But I think I understand the concerns, and it's really public health guidance that's been provided.



Okay.
One last question for the room before we go back to the phone.
Rachel from c. T.v.



Okay.
My first question is for Minister hajdu and Dr. Tam.
Five universities in china have done a study that a two-week quarantine may not be enough, and people may start showing symptoms after the two weeks.
Would Canada consider increasing this period, and is there any discussion about this?



Given this is a research question, I'll turn it over to Dr. Tam.



I think we will certainly review this paper, but of course there's always a distribution in terms of incubation period of when people feel sick.
It's still the most common median -- it's still five to six weeks -- five to six days, essentially.
So we have to take a look at the range, so I think, certainly, different health measures are layers, and you'renever going to catch the entirecurve, but our public health measures are there to encompass the range of that incubation period.
For all of those kinds of papers, I have to sort of review how solid the epidemiologic evidence is.



and I have a follow up question about the materials sent to china.
When Canada sent this, was there a reciprocal agreement by china to send back materials when we might need it?



Again, I'll turn it over to Dr. Tam about the principle of equipment sharing.



So I think at the outbreak -- I think we are in different moment in the pandemic, but the W.H.O. Calledfor global support to china, and I think it's a very important public health principle, which is containmentat source is the most importantthing one must do at the beginning of any outbreak.
By containing the epicentre, you're going to help the world, you're going to help Canada, as well.
In the end, I think it's helping to prevent further spread, and that will also affect Canada and the rest of the world.
That's really the concept, and I think that the global collaboration is extremely important, particularly in pandemic circumstances.
If you want someone to contain the source, whether it's west africa for ebola outbreak or essentially wuhan for the outbreak that impacted china first, that containment is critical.



Thank you.
We'll turn to the phone for the next questions.



**Caller**:

Okay.
Go ahead.



**Caller**:

Yes.
Good morning.
Hello.
Minister Freeland, I'd like to come back to the issue of the border and the Americans' intentions.
If you can't tell us exactly what those intentions are, I'd like to ask you, do you really take this idea by Donald trump seriously, and what happens on the transportation of goods, and what effect would it have on the supply chain? [speaking french language]



With regard to the discussion regarding the possibility that Washington would send troops to the Canadian border, I have to stress the fact that we're talking about a potential decision by the United States, and it is completely inappropriate for another country to talk about the internal conversations taking place in another country regarding a decision that may be made yet.
With regard to know precisely what the Americans are discussing in Washington, well, there, we have to speak directly to the Americans in Washington.
I want to be very clear here because it is important for Canadians to know that our government's position is a position that has already been expressed directly to our American neighbours.
It's that the proposal or the idea to have American troops sent to our border is unnecessary, as the public health situation does not require such action.
and on the Canadian side, we do not think that it would be appropriate given the very cordial relationship that our two countries have, and the military alliance that exists between our two countries.
With regard to the possibly -- possible sector of international trade between the two countries, I would like to say that the official decision has not yet been made, but that is not why we've taken such a strong position in our conversations with the Americans.
The idea of possibly sending troops to the border, well, I can assure Canadians that it's not because the Americans have some kind of intention to prevent trade from taking place.
It's not a trade issue.
At the same time, Canada has taken a strong position because we think that, symbolically speaking, and even philosophically speaking, when it comes to the relationship between the United States and Canada, it's important for us to have a border between neighbouring countries that have been friends for a very, very long time to be an unmilitaryized border.
Thank you.
So if we --



**Caller**:

So if we ask the question another way, we're asking about the border controls, for example, because of the high number of cases that are happening in new York state.



Well, we've already taken a position, and it's been described by our Minister of health.
[please stand by]



The trucks that come over theborder, they bring medication.
So preserving trade between the United states and Canada is very important and that's what we'vedone.
At the same time, we now have arestriction.
Dr. Tam was talking a few minutes ago about a truck driver who became symptomatic and public health took measures to help him.
So now, we have the necessaryrestrictions, but from hour tohour, we are examining the situation and we will always be ready to take all of the necessary measures to protectcanadian's health and theirlives.
Next question on the phone, please, operator.



The next question is frompaul vi era from the journal.



Good afternoon, can you hearme?



We sure can.



Ok. thank you.
Deputy Prime Minister, can you tell us when United States officials came forward to tell you about this idea regarding troops near theborder, please?



We first learned about the possibility a couple of daysago, a few days ago.



Have you spoken tomr.
Pompey or Mr. Pence about this and relayed youropposition? you talked about the defense secretary and homeland securitysecretary.
But have you spoken to anyone?



Canada made its position very clear at a number of levels and minister Blair has spoken to his counterparts and Minister harjitsajjan has spoken to his counterparts and there were conversations at the statedepartment.
We have had conversations with the white house and I have had conversations directly withamericans about this, withamerican leaders about this.
I have not yet spoken to secretary Pompey or vice president pence.



Next question on the phone before we turn back to the room.



The next question fromradio-Canada, please go made.
(speaking french).



Yes, hello.
I have a question and I would like to come back to the issue of troops.
You said that it could be damaging to the relationship between Canada and the United States.
What did you mean? and how do you see that developing in the future?



I think that I have already explained Canada's position.
Our relationship with the United States is very important tocanada.
and I think that relationship ISS very, very good one.
We are military allies.
We have a strong and important economic relationship and we have close practical cooperation at the border and that close cooperation was shown once again last week.
We made a very well-coordinatedmutual decision regarding travelrestrictions for nonessentialtravel because of thecoronavirus.
So for all of those reasons, forus, and we expressed thatdirectly to our americancounterparts, we think thatsending troops to the border isnot necessary and that it wouldbe a problem for our bilateralrelationship.
Followup? question, yes, I would like toclarify something.
People who come back to thecountry and who are inquarantine, we're told theycan't go out walking but thosewho are asymptom could go outfor a walk.
Could you carry us through stepby step in french what happensto somebody who comes into thecountry, has traveled abroad andneeds to get home to timmons, let's say? so what happens with thismandatory quarantine aftersomeone gets back into thecountry?



Yes, hello this is Dr. Njoo.
I will try in french to explain.
So for all travelers who come to the Canadian border, we have to separate out the travelers who are symptomatic and asymptomatic so for travelers sick at the border with this quarantine act, there has to be an assessment and if someone needs immediate medical care, we will conductfollow-up involving sending aperson to the hospital.
In the case of COVID-19, ifsomeone is a bit sick with a fewsymptoms, right away, we givethat person a pamphlet withinstructions with an ordersaying that it is necessary togo straight home andself-isolate and that is veryclear for symptomatic people.
So your question is about, ithink, asymptomatic people, sothose people are given an orderto self-isolate for 14 days, but it's slightly different becauseif people come through theborder with the United States, forexample, if they have a car andthey can go straight home, that's fine.
In principle, there's no stopthere, but it is or rather theyare in principle not supposed tostop anywhere on the way home.
For others other arrive atairports, it's the sameprinciple.
If a traveler is asymptomatic, they receive an order and a maskin case they receive symptomsand it's important for thatperson to take the nextconnecting flight to get to thenext airport and gettransportation to get straighthome.
With regard to exercise, we seethat for people who are arrivingin Canada from abroad, theirexposure to the virus broad, that risk is different thanforecanadians here inside ofcanada.
So it's a special situation.
So yes, we know that everybodyneeds fresh air, but inprinciple, maybe walking aroundthe backyard is Ok. but notreally.
Those people should not reallybe in contact with the generalpopulation.
is that enough clarification?



Thank you, doctor.
So we'll take two questions from the room and then we'll go back to the phone for two more questions and that's it. Cassie Johnson.



My first question is fordr.
Tam.
We're hearing from the companies that make ventilators that it would be much easier for them if there was a more streamlined process to deal with order distribution and, perhaps, even managing distribution.
is there a consideration to have single entity take over this rather than having companies field 15 or 16 from various regions and not know where to send them?



Thank you.
That's exactly what ishappening.
We are coordinating by and large with the provinces and territories to mass procure all of the items that we need.
There are still some provinces that are putting in individualorders, but we have encouraged them to work with us and in this procurement process to help streamline and facilitate those orders and also to be able to put in the bulk orders that will receive more attention in competitive space with others.
They're helping health Canada to streamline as much as possible, not only the quantity that we need, but also the specifics that are being required.



My second question, ibelieve, will be for ministerqualtro.
I'm wondering, what is the portal company that the canadiangovernment is using to administer the programme? it's not the same company that did phoenix, I'm assuming?



I thank you for yourquestion.
The portal will be ministered through the Canada revenue agency and we've done a deep dive in our systems andcanadians are confident that the ca can deliver all of your taxes are paid through ca, payments are made through ca childbenefit, your tax refunds, that's all through the ca and they is a massive capacity to administer bulk applications very streamlined and confidently and that's the security we were looking for and that's why it will be delivered through CIA.



Thank you.
No questions,, Julie van duesen.
So you can tell, wouldn't it be incumbent upon you to step up screening of the people they'resending over, truckers orotherwise, especially coming from a country where the virus is spreading so quickly?



So Julie, in terms of the ideas that are currently discussed within the United States administration, our understanding is that a decision has not yet been acted upon our fully taken.
Having said that, decisions are being taken at speed by governments around the world including ours and includingothers.
So it truly is both difficult and inappropriate for me to specify what is being discussed inside another government.
and I can say from our ownexperience, everyone right no win the whole world is operating on the principle of speed over perfection and it means things are being done fast.
They're being discussed quickly.
It also means ideas change a lot and so that's why I really understand the desire of reporters and Canadians to know precisely what is being discussed and it is simply impossible for me to offer thatprecision, partly because this is not something that we aredoing, but also because quiteunderstandably, this is something which is in the process of being discussed.
and so that is why I can't offerprecision.
Directionally, though, as understand it, the notion is need which all countries, ithink, today, are seeing including Canada, which is to have greater control at our borders at a time when there's global pandemic and that is something which our americanneighbours are also conscious of when it comes to their ownborders.
In fact, it is their shared view which is the driver of the reciprocal and coordinated decision we took with ouramerican neighbours about the border last week.
So that's kind of as much as Icahn tell you around the conversations that arehappening.
and maybe just to elaborate Little bit more.
We understand the concerns about the coronavirus.
We share those concerns very much and I hope everyone listened to Dr. Tam when she said to all of us, take thisseriously, look at what has happened in Italy.
I certainly sat up a little bit straighter when she said that.
This is something we need to take serious action and we are.
So we understand the seriousness of the issue and we understand the concern of our americanneighbours and friends.
What we have said is, we really do not believe at all that there would be a public health justification for you to take this action.
Of course, it's up to you to decide for yourselves.
and we've said, we really don'tthink this is the right way to treat a trusted friend and military ally.
So that's been Canada'sposition.
In terms of our position with regards to our own border, we have taken action and it is entirely appropriate to have more restrictions at all of our borders very much, including our border with the United States.
and we have taken measures that minister hajdu and Dr. Tam have been talking about today and yesterday to have mandatory quarantine for everyone enteringcanada including from the United States.
Those are appropriate measure sat this time.
Those are serious and stringent measures and we are constant liyreviewing the situation to see if action should be taken.
When it comes to things like truckers crossing the border --and first of all, I want to thank them for doing that essential work and I want to underscore to Canadians, is that all of us every single day depend on that cross-bordercommerce continuing.
We depend on that cross-bordercommerce for our shop shelvesbeing stocked and for crucialsupplies and equipment.
and just as within our owncountry, we are takingparticular steps when it comesto essential workers.
The same approach does and mustapply at the border.
Thanks.



Thank you.
Two more questions on the phone, please.



Yes, thank you.
The next question.
(speaking french).



Yes, hello.
I would like you to tell me about this idea that the Prime Minister mentioned this morning of asking to reduce credit card interest rates because we know that the household debt incanada is already a problem.
Can you tell us what that plan looks like, that you're working on with banks? what are you proposing to banks? answer, thank you for yourquestion.
There are two things.
So one thing that we've known for awhile is that banks incanada and that includes the one in Quebec have committed to doing everything they can to delay interest the payments to mortgage payments over the next six months.
Banks es have also committed to working with their clients to loosen the conditions for other types of loans, including loan son credit cards.
That means they have also committed to offering ways of reducing interest rates on some of the loans that people already have including credit card debt.
There will be options forclients, such as, for example, taking a fund from a credit card that are high interest credit cards and taking them and putting them into other types of credit modalities that people can have access to. You did not at all answer thequestion.
I want to know what you'reworking on with the banks beyond what has already been announced.
When you talk about an interest rate more reasonable for people under incredible economicpressure, do you have an idea inmind? is there anything specific or is there nothing on the table? answer, the proposal is what just said, that the banks and the movement has committed regard to mortgages and other types of credit to makecanadians and quebecors' lives easier in the next couple ofmonths.
With regard to mortgages, that is to be able to postpone capital payments for the next six months and for other loans, including credit card loans, the banks and the desjardinsmovement have committed to showing flexibility, including social responsibility, which is incumbent upon them in such difficult times for hundreds ofthousands, if not millions ofcanadians.
Thank you, last question on thephone, please.



Yes, thank you.
Our next question Abigail from the global news, please goahead.
Your line is open.



Hi, thanks for taking myquestion.
I heard earlier from Dr. Tam that the number of canadiansthat you are planning for, to arrange quarantine facilities for is in flux and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on how manyyou're planning for? are we talking about thousands more than that? I know I heard from ministerhadju, there are facilities bu tare there other facilitiesyou're engaging?



Well, for the quarantine act, we can actually take over specific sites, federal quarantine sites and some of them really have been hotels and so that's very key and we thank the collaboration we have, but it is something that is done through the quarantine act.
We, of course, also have plans Boer c, looking at other sites, including, for example, transit has been used for other repatriation flights.
So looking at federal sites, facilities and there are different ranges of those.
So I think we are expanding to examine all of the options.
Should they ever be required?



One followup.



Well, yes, you didn't answer my question in terms of how many people you're planning for, buti'm also wondering if you can --and I know we've heard some of this in french, but if you can, again, elaborate on the followup from public health in terms of following up with travelers by phone or in person.
and what happens when it comes to enforcement? is CBS involved? if you could paint that picture more clearly, thank you.



So anyone who is sick is immediately isolated if theycan't go directly home andthey're mildly ill.
If they're seriously ill, they go to hospital and a quarantine order is put on them and we, ofcourse, follow them.
Asymptomatic passengers are given an order to self-isolateand go directly as fast aspossible to your home.
and we will do random checks onthe asymptomatic people and thatcan be done in different ways, so a telephone call.
Of course, we collaborate withlocal public health, as well, some who have mandatory ordersto self-isolate.
If, for example, you didn't findsomeone home, well, we can alsocollaborate with local publichealth, because this is alsowithin their interest that theyknow what's happened to acertain resident in theirjurisdiction.
So that's what we would dofirst.
Of course, the quarantine acthas the penalties.
If someone is actually violatingthe quarante act, we can gothe furthest step to executethose fines or the penalties andthat hopefully would not happenvery frequently and that is whatwe are looking for.
But under the quarantine act, we can engage potentially peaceofficers, but this is adeterrent, if you like, aserious reminder of howabsolutely important it is toundergo self-isolation.
So that's how we envision theacts or orders to roll out.



Thank you.



Thank you very much.
