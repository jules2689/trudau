That is our daily update from the COVID-19committee.
Just a couple of things to clearup before we move on with ourcoverage.
Lots of details there about howthe quarantine act which wastaken into effect yesterday atmidnight, meaning that if youreturn to this country now, youare now legally required toself-isolate for 14 days and ifyou are showing symptoms whenyou land, in the first city youland in Canada, you will have toquarantine there and publichealth officials will find you aplace if that is needed.
Finally on this news that ourgovernment is confirming thatthe United States is consideringsending around 1, 000 troops nearthe Canada-United States border tomonitor people moving back andforth at irregular borderentries who may or may not havethe COVID-19. Chrystia Freeland saying veryclearly that Canada expresseddirectly to the United States administration that they do notwant this to happen, that theythink it's an entirelyunnecessary step which, as thedeputy Prime Minister says, theywould view as damaging to ourrelationship.
We are lead to believe by peoplewe are talking to that this isnot a final decision and notabout to happen, but it issomething that is beingdiscussed both in washingtonand, obviously, here in thenation's capitol.
I'll take you now to ontariowhere this province has had thelargest single-day increase ofcovid-19 cases.
