coronavirus pandemic.
The leaders of the world met virtually by video conference this morning and we are standing by to hear more about that fromjustin Trudeau, Canada's Prime Minister, as we await his daily briefing which will happen in 15minute's time.
To give you a state of play herein this country, let me bring you up to date on the recentnumbers.
More than 3400 cases, confirmed cases of COVID-19, at least 36deaths, nearly half of Canada'scovid-19 cases are being acquired through community spread which is, of course, one of the reasons why public health officials and government officials are telling people to stay inside and limit their socializing and to self isolate as much as possible.
It came through travel but given much of the travel has now been shut down into this country or heavily restricted, the community spread has become the biggest cause of this or at least half of the cause of this and is the major concern for public health officials.
Every province and territory ha snow declared some sort of state of emergency, health emergency or general state of emergency.
Provinces are limiting who is coming into their provinces and telling people to self-isolatefor 14 days even if they'vetraveled within Canada.
I just want to show everyone ashot, a photo, if I can, of theg20 leaders in thisextraordinary time meeting andvirtually.
All of them around the worldgetting together for a largeteleconference.
I believe you can see our Prime Minister right in the middlethere.
That call, an attempt to talknot just about controlling thepandemic and making sure theworld's health organization hasenough money and capacity butmaking sure they can shore upthe economic system.
There he is, a nice close-up ofhim there.
So, obviously, the Prime Minister will talk about thatwhen he hear from him in 15minute's time.
Let me bring in vassey kapelosand catherine cullen.
So obviously this meeting comesafter a g7 meeting where therewas a lot of difficulty, ithink, with the secretary ofstate, mike pompeo, because the United states wanted thestatement which never came outto include some language thatthe president has beenpropagating instead of callingit COVID-19, trying to call itthe china virus and wuhan virusand that didn't work for any ofthe other g7 foreign ministers, so no statement came out of thatcall.
I would imagine, sounds like, that the g20 call went better.
Vassy, I think you just finishedinterviewing the Minister offoreign affairs?
