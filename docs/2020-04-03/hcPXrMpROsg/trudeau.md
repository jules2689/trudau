**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to begin by recognizing that a lot of people have been stuck at home for a week or more because of COVID-19. That's starting to take a toll, it's understandable.
But we can't afford to stop now.
I want to be clear.
Social distancing, physical distancing is the single best way to keep the people around you safe.
It means keeping metres between yourself and someone else.
It means avoiding groups.
It means staying home as much as possible.
If you choose to ignore that advice, if you choose to get together with people or go to crowded places, you're not just putting yourself at risk.
You're putting others at risk, too.
Your elderly relative who's in a senior's home or your friend with a preexisting condition.
Our nurses and doctors on the frontlines.
Our workers stocking sh*efls at a grocery store, they need you to make the right choices.
They need you to do your part.
We've all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they're invincible and enough is enough.
Go home and stay home.
This is what we all need to be doing.
and we're going to make sure this happens, whether by educating people more on the risks or by enforcing the rules if it's kneed.
Nothing that could help is off the table.
Today is watching federal advertising campaigns.
You'll see faces that you know and trust.
Getting out the recommendations from our health care workers.
Not having heard this message won't be an excuse.
It is your duty and staying home is your way to serve.
Every day there are more and more people who step up and heed this call.
Just yesterday team Canada and the paralympic team made the tough decision not to send athletes to the olympic and paralympic game this is summer.
I know this is heartbreaking for so many people.
Athletes, coaches, staff and fans.
This is absolutely the right call and everyone should follow their lead.
No matter who you are, if you are doing your part, then I want to say thank you.
You are saving lives.
and when it gets hard, know that your government is right there with you.
We will unveil an $82 billion plan for businesses affected by the virus.
If you are worried about making ends meet, we're putting more money in your pocket.
If you own a small business, we're helping you bridge to better times.
Tomorrow, the house of commons will reconvene to pass emergency legislation and put this plan in motion.
For farmers and people across the agri food business, I know these are hard times, too.
, so we're also opening up $5 billion in additional lending capacity.
Starting today, farmers and producers can apply through farm credit Canada for the support they need to keep food growing and getting it on to our tables.
On that note, I want to say thank you to people across the entire food sector.
Day in and day out.
You grow, transport and stock the food that feed our families.
Last week, we also announced a plan to mobilize industry so our hospitals have the medical support and equipment they need.
Later today, I'll have a call with the first ministers to discuss our continued coordination on quarantine and self-isolation.
We're working together to make sure everyone has what they need, whether that's equipment for testing or medical supplies.
This evening t premiers and I will also talk about continuing to move forward with measures to support families and small businesses to ensure our economy rebounds.
For Canadians stranded abroad, we're working with airlines to get people home.
People should be returning by commercial means while they're still available.
Westjet and sunwing all have flight this is week.
As of today, we secured authorizations for air Canada to operate three flights for this week for Canadians in peru and there will be two more flights in the coming days from morocco.
We've also helped secure an air Canada flight from spain as well as two air transat flights from honduras, el salvador and guatemala.
If you are a canadian abroad, register with the government now so we can send you updates and contact you.
You need to do this.

We invested $275 million in research on coronavirus and the development of vaccines.
We can see this with the flu.
Vaccines prevent people from getting ill, for protecting the most vulnerable to ensure that fewer and fewer people stand up in the emergency department.
Today I'm announcing that we will be investing $192 million to provide direct support to the development and production of vaccines in Canada.
This would be a long-term solution to the coronavirus.
We are working with a company in Quebec to test vaccines.
At the same time, we have provided funds to vaccines and infectious disease organisations in Saskatchewan for the development of vaccines and clinical trials.
Canada needs that in order to provide mass treatment as soon as possible.
We are also investing in national research council facilities in montreal.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

$192 million to directly support vaccine development and production in Canada.
We're investing in a long-term solution to COVID-19 right here at home.
We will be working with a vancouver-based company to develop a drug to prevent and treat COVID-19. We're also working with a Quebec city-based company for vaccine testing and production.
At the same time, we're providing funding for the university of Saskatchewan's vaccine organization for development and clinical trials.
Once there are promisingsings, Canada needs the capacity to mass produce treatments as quickly as possible.
That's why we're investing in the national research council of Canada's facility in montreal to prepare for the roll-out.
These are critical steps forward.
But we have to remember that vaccines won't be ready overnight.
They will take months.
So while that's happening, we need to work to mitigate the impacts of this virus.
and luckily, we have the tools we need right here at home.
Blue dot in toronto was among the first in the world to identify the spread of COVID-19 coming in nine days ahead of the world health organization's public warning.
We've signed a contract to use this canadian software to model the disease.
It will help us track and, therefore, slow the spread.
Minister Bains has also sent a call to action to every university, college, polytechnique and cegep in the country.
Their labs have the resources and expertise to be part of this fight.
We asked them to identify equipment they got like masks and ventilators.
At the same time, we're looking at innovative solutions they can be part of, including 3d printing of medical supplies.
Many institutions have already stepped up and many more will do the same.
If you need more information, go to buyandsell.
Gc. Ca. We need all hands on deck.

**Interpreter**:

We all have a role to play in the fight against coif.
Even if you are not a first res ponder or researcher, you can save lives by remaining at home as much as possible, maintaining a distance of at least two metres from others if you must go out.
You can do and make a difference.
That's how we can protect ourselves, protect our nurses and doctors and health care professionals who are caring people who need help.
Please follow the recommendations of our public health officials.
We have to trust them and we have to listen.
Yesterday I had an opportunity to talk to some people and today I'm thinking about our ?roirs.
-- our seniors.
We all have loved ones at home who are extremely vulnerable.
Call them.
Tell them that you love them.
I myself am thinking of My father-in-law.
Who is receiving treatment for a cancer and has been a few months.
So, we haven't seen him for a while.
Today is his birthday.
He is 77 today.
Happy birthday.
Think of your own loved ones and do whatever you can to keep them safe.
That is how we can stop COVID-19. Thank you for doing your part and know that our government will continue to work all the time to protect you and together we will come through this.
Thank you very much.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Mr. Prime Minister.
It's Annie bergeron Oliver with CTV national news.
You said that the government has put in place suspensions.
What immediate and specific actions is the federal government doing to increase testing capabilities and to reduce the testing backlogs that people are facing right across the country?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we said on vaccines, we have moved forward on investing in a number of companies to accelerate their movement toward clinical trials and eventual production of a vaccine.
In the meantime, we're increasing our testing capacity every single day.
Many companies in Canada are increasing their production.
We're working with labs across the country to accelerate the arrival of testing results as well.
We recognize that there is a significant load on the system.
We are looking at technological and concrete solutions that will accelerate this process because we recognize that mass testing is a key part of the path forward.




**Interpreter**:

We will be helping a number of companies to help them transition to the clinical trial process.
But all of this will take a number of months.
For the time being, we know that testing is absolutely essential and we're investing to expedite the availability of test kits and also to accelerate the process to receive results.
There is a huge burden on the health care system at this time.
But we must do more because we know that testing is part of how we can slow the spread of COVID-19.



**Reporter**:

a lot of people sitting at home right now watching this press conference who cannot afford to continue paying their rent for themselves or for their businesses.
Why hasn't your government done more to specifically help renters?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know there are significant pressures on Canadians across the country who are facing bills coming in, facing pressures on caring for their families.
That is why we are working extremely quickly to get money out the door, into the pockets of Canadians during this extraordinary time.
We recognize there are hundreds of thousands of Canadians out there applying for e. I. benefits online.
What we're working through, including with the stem of recalling parliament tomorrow is a legislative package that will allow us to move forward even quicker on getting money into pockets of Canadians who need it across the country.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

is it prudent to hold an international event of that magnitude at this time? I know there are many concerns out there about any international gathering and we understand that president Abe of japan is very much aware of those challenges.
Now the Canadian Olympic committee did make the decision that Canadian athletes would not attend the Olympics this year.
They announced that last night.
But I'm encouraging everyone who is thinking of going to large gatherings to not go and not hold them.
and I mean not only in Canada, but around the world.
Everyone has to stay home.
Looking at what's happening in Canada, you talked about the fact that there are people who don't seem to be paying any attention to the advice they're being given.
Do you find it shocking to see that? and does that mean that the so-called borders between the provinces should perhaps be closed? will you be discussing that with the premiers? yes, we'll definitely be talking about that with the premiers.
We have to continue to co-ordinate our approach but our communications.
Unfortunately, as we've all seen, some people think they're invincible.
They continue to go outside, especially since the weather is getting better.
But this is not the time to do that.
People have to keep a safe distance.
People have to stay home as much as possible because it's not just about being vulnerable yourself.
But making seniors and other people vulnerable or putting others at risk who work in our health care system.
We need to follow the advice of experts.
They are all telling us to stay home and to keep an appropriate distance from other people.



**Reporter**:

How exactly will your government enforce social distancing? can you spell out exactly what that will look like?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Speaking with the premiers this evening and talking about ways we can co-ordinate, we recognize that many communities, many provinces have declared states of emergency.
They have taken measures to close certain public places.
There is more that can be done.
There is more that needs to be done around messaging and that's what we're going to be talking about.
But every step of the way, if we see that measures aren't being taken up properly, that aren't being followed, we will look at different measures that could be necessary to enforce these rules.
We'd rather not and we know that millions of Canadians are doing their part.
But those who are not doing their part are putting at risk everyone else, including the eventual recovery of our economy and the well-being of millions of Canadians.
So we'll continue to look very carefully at what could be next steps as we move forward.



**Reporter**:

Can you spell out exactly what kind of enforcement measures you are looking at at the national level?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I can tell you that we haven't taken anything off the table from the emergencies act to new measures or existing measures under the quarantine act.
There are significant acts that are at our disposable.
We're impressing upon Canadians to do this of their own will, to understand that individuals can and must do their part to keep us all safe and to ensure that we come through this in the best way possible.



**Reporter**:

Should all [inaudible] close their borders?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I will be speaking with the premiers about measures that we can take to move forward and I look forward to that conversation.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, I'm wondering, this week will be the end of your 14-day self-isolation.
Are you planning to resume quasi-public schedule or planning to leave the house?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As many people are, I'm listening to the advice of experts.
I recognize that there is still a week to go in My self-isolation and we're going to continue doing that.
Those decisions on what next will be taken in the right way depending on what public health says.
But certainly I am going to make sure that we continue to follow all recommendations of public health officers, particularly around staying at home, wherever possible and self-isolation.
and social distancing which means keeping two metres apart from each other.



**Reporter**:

In terms of the messaging, we've seen people at beaches and out on trails clustereding to and people at large parties together.
Do you think it's just a question of people not getting the message? because you are talking a lot about messaging today.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think people need to get the message that this isn't just about them.
This is about their neighbours.
This is about vulnerable seniors.
This is about health workers who are on the front lines trying to keep us all safe.
Canadians can and must do their part to keep us all safe.
When we see images of people out enjoying the sunshine in large groups, that is extremely concerning because they are not just putting themselves at risk, they are putting everyone else at risk.
We need to slow and stop the spread of this virus if we're going to come through this strongly as a country, without losing too many of our loved ones.
Every single Canadian has a responsibility to engage in keeping their distance and staying home whenever possible and ensuring those who have to go home for essential services and keep us healthy and alive and fed are not at risk themselves.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

It is frustrating for many Canadians stuck at home to see that other people are disregarding the protocols and the recommendations being made by public health officials.
So it's very frustrating for a lot of people when they see that people don't pay any attention.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

and staying home for their safety to watch other people out there putting not just themselves at risk but everyone who is staying home at risk as well.



**Reporter**:





**Rosemary**:

and one of the ongoing concerns seems to be around testing kits.
There don't seem to be enough of them.
At last count there was more than 90, 000 tests that had been done.
There is a delay on getting the results.
a heavy strain on the health care system for all of those different things.
Ok. I'm told that the ministers are about to talk to us. So we'll speak to both of you after this.
Let's take you live to the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland.







Let me just start by repeat ago clear message that we have been hearing all through the weekend and for many days from Minister hajdu and we just heard clearly from the Prime Minister.
Canadians must practice social and physical distancing.
That means stay at home unless, of course, you are doing essential work.
For example, stocking our grocery shelves, working in a drugstore or providing medical care.
and there are other essential jobs people need to continue to do but everyone else please stay at home.
Limit or eliminate contact with people at higher risk such as all those seniors who you love and people at -- in poor health.




**Interpreter**:

Eliminating contact with all at-risk people such as seniors or with people with a lower level of health is also essential.



We'll hear from Dr. Tam, our chief public health officer.




**Interpreter**:

Who will be talking about support for our farmers and producers who are doing imminent work for our country.



Innovation, science and industry, navdeep Bains who will discuss COVID-19 research that he is strongly supporting and we have, of course, also available to answer questions.
Minister of health, patty hajdu.
Dr. Howard njoo and 



**Interpreter**:

and president of the treasury board.



Hello, everyone.
Globally there are over 340, 000 cases of COVID-19. In 189 countries.
In Canada, as of this moment, there are 1474 cases of COVID-19 and 20 deaths.
The Yukon reported its first two cases, which were linked to travel.
Tomorrow, repatriated passengers from the grand princess remain symptom-free at the end of their 14-day quarantine period and will be released from c. F.b. Trenton.
Passengers who tested positive for the virus and asymptomatic contacts whose quarantine period was reset will remain at c. F.b. Trenton until their extend release date.
We've now tested over 102, 000 people in Canada.
Which is an average of approximately 10, 000 a day.
Many of those cases were exposed to virus outside of Canada, but in addition we are seeing more cases not linked to travel.
Most concerning of all are the cases occurring among high-risk populations in vulnerable settings and communities.




**Interpreter**:

We need to continue with strict public health and infection control measures.
But to further protect all of these populations as well as our health system and all of our communities, we must slow community spread through unrelenting social distancing.



Caller:



**Interpreter**:

a key reason we want to flatten the curb is for innovation and research to occur.
It has been just under three months ago that scientists first identified the novel coronavirus.
During this time, Canada has stepped up on a wide range of research.
From biomedical solutions such as diagnostics, vaccines and treatments to social and behavioral science.
We should be proud that Canadian researchers are part of the W.H.O. Large global trial called solidarity.
This is designed to rapidly gather data on the most promising therapies for COVID-19. It is an all-out coordinated approach involving multiple countries to collect robust scientific data rainedly during this pandemic.



Vulnerable population and prevent an even greater acceleration of spread in high-risk settings, we need to continue with strict public health and infection control measures but to further protect all of these populations as well at the health system and all of our communities, we must slow community spread through unrelenting social distancing.
a key reason we want to delay and flatten the epidemic curve is to buy time for research and innovation to occur.

Let's keep up the moment and let's get this right.
Everyone who is practicing social distance and self-isolation is giving researchers a chance to work on novel solutions.
Merci.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.



**Interpreter**:

We're helping to manage the impact of the outbreak.



This morning, the Prime Minister announced two new measures we're taking to respond to the agriculture sector's immediate needs.
Farm credit Canada.
So, first farm credit Canada as we all call f. C.c. is receiving an extra $5 billion in lending capacity.
This injection of credit will permit f. C.c. To help food and farm business owners on the principle and/or interest portions of their loan and add access to additional credit line.
F.c. C. agents are standing by to help.




**Interpreter**:

I'm pleased to announce that f. C.c. Will see its capacity increase by $5 billion.
This injection will allow f. C.c. To help producers, agri-business and food processors on a case-by-case basis to grant an extra line of credit.
F.c. C. finance authorities are ready to help their kleins.



I'm also pleased to announce that all eligible farmers who have an outstanding advance payments programme loan deadline on April 30 or earlier will now receive a stay of default for additional six months.
This represents a total of $173 million in deferred loans.
For the farmer and food processors who are facing tight margins in a cash crunch together, the two measures announced today will help keep money in their pocket when they need it most.

This represents a total of $173 million in deferred loans for farmers and fruit processors who are facing tight margins and a cash crunch, these measures will help keep money in their pockets when they need it most.



They are unprecedented times for our farmers and food businesses.
I am in regular contact with the industry and My provincial and territorial counterparts and our government is mongering around-the-clock to take all the necessary steps to deal with this crisis.
Once again, I want to thank sincerely everyone in the food supply chain.
Everyone who, despite the concern, goes to work every day so the rest of us can have food to eat.
During these times we see just how critical they are to our country.



**Interpreter**:

I would like to thank all workers throughout our country who work in the food supply chain who go to work every single day despite their worries in order to feed us all.
More than ever, we realise how important their work is. So thank you to them.



Thank you.



Thank you, Chrystia.
I would like to congratulate our first-class workers.



Our world-class scientists and researchers and in particular our chief science adviser for her outstanding leadership throughout this crisis.
As was announced last Friday, we put in place Canada's plan to probablyize industry to fight COVID-19. and today we're complementing those efforts with plans to quickly mobilize canadian researchers working on countermeasures to combat daytona 500ed.
-- COVID-19. Fortunately our country's research committee is amongst the strongest in the world.
Canadian labs discovered the ebola vaccine and were the first in the world to sequence a DNA For the sars virus in. 2018, you are government announced the largest funding toward science and those researchers that we count on today.
We've identified several projects for investment that are already under way from university researchers and others to resfonlds COVID-19. a natural partner in this regard is the university of Saskatchewan's international vaccine centre.
As one of world's most advanced infection disease research facilities, it was the first facility in Canada to receive clearance to harvest samle s of the COVID-19 virus.
So, we're investing $23 million to help the centre expand and renovate its current animal vaccine production facility to meet the standards required for producing human vaccines.
This will allow the centre to produce vaccines for clinical trials as well to meet early production needs when a vaccine is ready.
We are also investing $15 million to expand and upgrade the national research council's human health therapeutics research centre in montreal.
This will allow the n. R.c. To partner with researchers across the country to produce vaccines and therapies for clinical trials and to meet early needs for frontline health care workers when an approved vaccine becomes available.
Now as we speak on Friday, Canada's fight against COVID-19 requires all hands on deck.
and that most certainly includes the private sector.
To make it easier for companies and research institutions to contribute to vaccine development, we've haded a new stream to the strategic innovation front.
To be focused on the fight against COVID-19 and we topped that fund by $192 million to ensure resources are available.
We have identified new projects that will be prioritized under the direct support to canadian companies for large scale projects.




**Interpreter**:

They will receive funds to accelerate its -- their clinical trials.



This funding will accelerate clinical trials and then production.
They will use its platform to develop anti viral therapies for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.
The aim is to begin clinical trials this summer.
In addition to those two projects we have just signed a contract for the blue dot.
Toronto-based digital health firm was among the first in the world to identify the spread of COVID-19. They use artificial intelligence in a range of a dataset including global air travel to correctly track the spread of the disease around the world.
Now our government will use blue dot software to support modeling and monitoring of COVID-19 spread and inform future federal decisions relate toltd the virus.




**Interpreter**:

We would like to act as rapidly as possible to help its health care system and its workers.



Today, and with the help of our industrial-based and research community, we'll do exactly that.
Merci.beaucoup.
Thank you.



Thank you very much.
and we're now ready to take your questions.



Ok. As discussed, we'll do three questions on the phone first.
One question, one follow-up and then come back to the room.
So, operator.
