Prime Minister Justin Trudeau very soon about measures to sanction individual Canadians and businesses and other measures that the government is putting in place to ramp up production, for instance, of medical supplies and research.
The Prime Minister, as you might remember, is still in self-isolation.
He also, though, has a number of phone calls he will be making today, both a meeting with Canada's premiers later today and he is speaking with the Prime Minister of japan, shinzo abe.
This comes after the canadian olympic commission -- committee decided that Canada would not be sending its athletes to the olympic games, which, for now, has still not been postponed.
I'm not sure if we have a live look -- yes, we do. The Prime Minister's home there, Rideau cottage.
You've become familiar to it as this is around the time that he comes out every morning to bring us up to date on some of the latest measures that the government is working on. To both contain the pandemic, but also address the very pressing and real economic issues.
We're expecting him in about 15 minutes' time.
Let me bring you up to speed on a couple of the developments in this country.
First of all, we are now at more than 1500 positive cases of COVID-19 in this country.
20 deaths still.
One canadian has died in japan.
The leading number of cases in the country remain in Ontario and British Columbia.
Dr. Teresa tam has said that the concern -- they remain very concerned about the virus getting into, quote, high risk settings like long-term care centres, which is where we've seen many of the deaths or other vulnerable communities and she and the government have been calling again on Canadians to really follow those rules around self-isolation and social distancing.
All right.
While we wait for the Prime Minister, let's bring in the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos and the cbc's david Cochrane in our parliamentary bureau.
No longer sure of the day.
I'm told it's Monday.
Vassy, what are we expecting from the Prime Minister today?



**Vassy**:

Ok. Two things that I would flag.
The first is that you'll remember I think it was -- I'm losing track of time -- but a few weeks ago that the Prime Minister made an initial amount of money for a variety of things.
This is before the big $80 billion package last week.
Part of it was $275 million to go into research and essentially vaccine research as well as clinical trials where treatment is concerned.
I am told that we'll get very specific granular details on where exactly that money is going, to which research projects and the aim of those research projects is. The second thing I'm told we can expect is help for farmers.
Billions of dollars of supports through farm credit Canada.
So that would be in the vein of credit, obviously, which we have seen previously announced for businesses writ large.
The idea of allowing banks to have more credit available to lend to small businesses and bigger businesses to get through this.
This will be very much targeted in support towards farmers.
So, I'm told up to $5 billion made available.
I'm expecting the Prime Minister to talk about that.
The other thing is from the perspective of what questions still remain out there, I think the Prime Minister will be getting questions on something we heard from patty haj, the u yesterday and that is the possibility of imposing, for example, fines or penalties on people who are not self-isolating when they come back.
We have seen a bigger discussion among the provinces.
We've seen various measures taken individually by provinces.
Will there be some kind of federal coordination where that is concerned? I'm told by at least a few premiers that there isn't a consensus on that.
I think the federal role in all of this, in enforcing so much of what you were talking about when it comes to social distancing will be a big question for the Prime Minister going to ward.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
We saw the mayor of Vancouver, Kennedy Stewart, who we're hoping to get on over the next two hours, really very visibly frustrated yesterday with the fact that many people in his city were not following those measures so he's now cracked down as well, saying there will be extensive fines for people if they continue to gather in large numbers in places.
and I guess one of the questions is what else -- what other tools are there in the tool box do cities have to reinforce that message?



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
We saw an angry Kennedy Stewart yesterday and very angry Stephen McNeil, the premier of Nova Scotia who got it going really with his lecture of Nova Scotians who blatantly flaunts ed public health advice by gathering in large crowds in public spaces and even say if you go to one of our public parks now, we'll tow your car.
If you want to go there, that's fine.
But you'll have a long walk home Baez we'll take your vehicle away.
It is a hopscotching across the country as everyone moves to toughen their measures to clamp down on crowds.
There have been a lot of questions from journalists and the Prime Minister about using the measures act which will be -- the emergency act, excuse me, which will be an extraordinary thing for the federal government to do. Patty hajdu is getting tired of recommending and will soon start ordering and that can be done through the quarantine act, which she is responsible for as the Minister of health and that can put restrictions on crowds and leading to fines if people and businesses defy the regulations and the orders.
It seems to me, rosey, that a sharpening of the public messaging is a very clear thing that they're doing right now.
But also hoping that the combined stacked effect of municipal and provincial states of emergency and public health emergencies and, if necessary, the national quarantine act, would be what they need to use to rein in irresponsible ba*ef your that threatens the health of an entire country.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Three more flights have been confirmed by the Minister of foreign affairs from Peru for Canadians.
That will happen over the course of the week and there will be more flights to come.
He continues to update us and we'll go to the story of the Olympics in. a dramatic move, after lots of uncertainty around the 2020 games in Tokyo, Canada has decided that it will not be sending its athletes.
The decision came down late last night from the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic committees.
It is calling at this stage for a one-year postponement saying Canadians will not be sent to japan if the games go on as planned.
Let's bring in diana matheson, a member of the soccer team.
I imagine sort of mixed feelings about all of this.



I'm not going to the games this year, but I think a lot of Canadian athletes are feeling proud to be part of a team Canada and a Canadian Olympic committee that was one of the first countries to take the stands.
I think it is the right decision given the global community's health.
That's paramount.
and I think we're proud and disappointed at the moment.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.
I get that.
Does it seem crazy to you that they're still thinking about having the games at all?



Yes.
Hopefully Canada and now Australia that they won't go in 2020 and will push thismo.
C. to have it next year.
If I had to guess, I think they will make a decision to postpone and just use the next few weeks to pick a date that will work.



**Rosemary**:

How has your training been affected by this? I guess that is the other thing.
I don't know if you can train properly, given all the social distancing measures that are in place.



Nope.
I mean, none of us are really training the way we would be training.
It's kind of sport by sport.
Our team returned from France about two weeks ago.
We've been socially isolating.
I'm going to try to stay in shape, but by no means are we preparing for an Olympic games with the workouts we're doing.
and I'll add to some of the other conversations going on and we see groups of kids and teenagers playing soccer and it hurts to see that because we're giving up training for an Olympics and team Canada is giving up the chance to go and not socially isolate.
and that has been echoed by other athletings as well.
We want to say that it's important to lead and the right thing to do and we as Olympians are trying to take steps to lead and doing the right thing.
Work out at home.
But please stop playing soccer in the parks with 20 people.
I'm not playing association you shouldn't be either.



**Rosemary**:

I saw some guys playing basketball when I went for a walk and thought the same thing.
I'll leave it on this, Diana.
You've been in an Olympics before, I would guess.
But maybe some of your colleagues and your teammates have not.
How much worse is it for people who were, like, just desperate to have their first Olympic experience?



Yeah.
I've had that conversation wondering [inaudible] this would be My fourth visit.
[inaudible] so it might be their only.
I'm still very, very positive the I. O.c. and [inaudible] will postpone the next year so all these athletes have a chance to go to games.
That is the right thing and they'll come to that decision.
But even for myself, [inaudible]. I think it comes down to all Canadians and they know this is the right thing to do for the health of our family, our support teams and communities.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you.
Real good leadership efforts as member of the Olympic soccer team and Canadians in general.
Thank you for your time.



Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you.
As we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister, we should be out and about for four minutes.
Nova Scotia has implemented new controls at its borders.
Starting today, anyone entering the province is required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Doesn't matter where you're coming from.
It's part of the state of emergency declared yesterday.
Brett ruskin is near amherst, Nova Scotia where the new restrictions are enforced.
If I cut you off, it's only because the Prime Minister is coming off.
But off you go.



**Reporter**:

The folks that you see in the bright green and yellow vests, this again at the border and everyone coming into Nova Scotia, whether you've traveled from abroad and across the border in New Brunswick, Quebec or Ontario, you're asked to self-isolate for 14 days.
That was an announcement that was made by premier stephen mcneil yesterday saying that there are exemptions to that rule.
The truck driver as you just heard honk as we went past as well as medical staff and essential service personnel.
Everyone else who is arriving, even just from New Brunswick, across the way here, needs to self-isolate and that is can what people are handed here once they self-isolate and headed here to in Nova Scotia.



**Rosemary**:

and the premier seemed frustrated because they were still gathering in large groups.
What else can you tell us about the restrictions now in place?



**Reporter**:

Let's talk about the fines for violating this self-isolation act, $1, 000 per individual, per day.
If it's found to be in contravention of this new rule.
That's for individuals.
$7500 at least for businesses that are found to be encouraging or allowing gatherings of five people or more.
Stiff fines for people who are not keeping up with this self-isolation rule.
One slight flaw in the system that we see here is that the officials aren't actually collecting any information from people.
They're not taking down license plates or names or anything like that.
So, witness they go past this checkpoint and start driving into the province of Nova Scotia, there's no telling who should be self-isolating.
They're still working out kinks here at this tightened border crossing here in Nova Scotia.



**Rosemary**:

a tightened inter provincial border which is extremely unusual.
But so are the times we're living in. Brett Ruskin, thank you so much.
That's the cbc's Brett Ruskin in Amherst, Nova Scotia.
We're watching there, looking at the front door of the Prime Minister's house as we wait for him to emerge and talk to Canadians as he has been every day about what measures his government is moving forward on. Let me bring in Vassy kapelos as we stand by and way.
Probably only going to get to one of you, to be honest.
Vassy, I mean, there's been a lot of different measures over a lot of different -- over a long space of time here.
and today we are expecting to hear a little bit more about the kinds of things that industries and companies can do to shore up supply and make sure that Canada really has the products, the medical supplies I needs going forward.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
This is something that we heard the medical community talk about a lot in the lead up to this press conference and that is whether or not they have the ability to adequately treat the kinds of numbers that they see in the health care system.
Will they have the equipment necessary.
If they don't, we saw an announcement from Minister navdeep Bains last week directing all of his ministry's capabilities towards this, quote-unquote, fight against COVID-19 and sort of encouraging the scaling up, for example, if you already make masks, of making more masks.
How do they do that? is that through an injection of funds or retooling existing facilities from other companies in order to produce those masks or hand sanitizer or whatever kind of P.P.E. Or personal protective equipment the medical community and doctors and nurses and respiratory therapists need to do their job.
We're expecting more details from Minister Bains about how they're going do that.
In Ontario there will be an announcement today that retools their entire ministry of economic development to focus on this as well.
They set up a website for businesses that have reached out.
How can we help? how can we change our business model in order to accommodate the needs out there.
This announcement coming out of the Ontario government and premier ford this afternoon will be a follow to that.
There are efforts provincially and now federally as well to address that issue.



**Rosemary**:

Excellent timing.
Here's the Prime Minister of Canada.
