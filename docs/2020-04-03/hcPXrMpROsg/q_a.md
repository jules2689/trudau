The first question is from Brian lillley of the Toronto sun.
In what expert powers would the emergencies act or quarantine act give you that you currently don't have.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The quarantine act is already in place and gives you significantly toos.
One of the key elements of the emergencies act is that it is an override over the provinces.
It takes powers that are normally only in the hands of provinces or even municipalities and puts them at the federal level.
That is why we've been working closely and co-ordinating, watching closely as provinces have invoked their emergencies act, which has been an important step in fighting the spread of this virus.
It's also why we will certainly be talk about the federal emergencies act at the premier's meeting this evening to make sure that we all understand what tools each different order of government has and where we might need to do more.



Thank you.
Merci.




**Interpreter**:

I'm sure you've been in touch with your counterparts already.
Are there some provinces that have asked you to invoke the emergency measures act.
No province has asked us to enact that act.
But as I said, much of the emergency measures act involves taking powers from the provinces and placing them at the federal level.
This is a conversation we must have with the provinces.



Thank you, Merci.
The last question is from  please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Yes.
Thank you, Prime Minister.
In the United States, California, new York has enacted lock down levels at the state level.
You're not ready yet to invoke the emergencies act.
But would you support provinces in enacting similar measures in Canada?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that provinces and cities are looking at what next steps they can take.
We, of course, will support them in their decision-making and the powers they have, recognizing that many of them, if not all of them, have invoked the emergencies act in their -- at their provincial level.
We will continue to co-ordinate and make sure that they have the backing of the federal government where necessary.
We will continue to monitor closely this situation, to work with experts across Canada and indeed around the world on everything we need to do to keep Canadians safe.
But even as we do that, with all the levers of governments and regulations and powers, fundamentally it comes down to citizens making smarter choices.
Choosing to stay home.
Choosing to self-isolate.
Choosing to keep their distance from each other.
Not going out and putting at risk people who have to be out for essential reasons in our hospitals, in our food supply and pharmacies.
These are the things that people need to be doing.
These are things that not everyone is doing yet and that is why it is so important for Canadians to step up to do what they can, not only to keep themselves safe but their neighbours and the rest of us safe as well.
Merci.



Thank you.
Merci.
If you have any questions, please press star 1 on your telephone key pad.
 first question is from the "national post". please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi, this is for Dr. Tam.
This es a specific question.
But in some Asian countries like Taiwan and Singapore and south Korea, they have a lot of success in getting the epidemic under control by using tried and true epidemic kind of detective work.
The contact tracing and strictly isolating people.
In Singapore, they recruited police to contact tracing process and they're using, you know, cell phones to track people who have had contact with infected people.
I hear a lot about social distancing, but not much about that kind of sort of detective work in terms of identifying who's infected and who's had contact with them.
I know that [inaudible] local public health offices.
But to your knowledge s that still going on? or have we given up on that?



Very rigorous contact tracing is still being carried out in every province and local municipality, local public health right now.
That is still Canada's strategy sophomore if you have a traveler who has come in with positive diagnosis, all of those contacts are still being tracked.
If you have a community cluster like the one in Vancouver, for example, that is linked to a long-term care facility, all of those contracts completely trakd.
and so absolutely that is a very intensive piece of work right now that is still going on. We'll continue to do this.



**Caller**:

The cost of the cruise ship that locked ed in Marseilles a couple of days ago, there's reports that there are a number of people with COVID-19 and other people quite severely.
What sort of efforts have we made to sort of track the Canadians that came off that ship and apparently have returned to north America in the last couple of days?



So, we work very closely with global affairs Canada because we are with Canadians on a number of cruise ships around the world.
So anytime that Canadians could be exposed to coronavirus on any cruise ship, we will track that, we will get the manifest and if they should be entering Canada, flag any passengers from those cruise ships in other words to identify them.
and it could be any number of potential ships happening.
We are trying to trace those very vigorously.



and if I could say also we can't hear you so clearly so if you are working -- teleworking, please speak close to the phone and maybe not into a speakerphone but use your handset to be sure we can hear you.
Thanks.



Thank you, Merci.
The next question.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning.
a specific question for Dr. Tam.
Could you give us the exact number of the number of people who remain in quarantine in c. F.b. Trenton.
People who are ill.
How many people remain after tomorrow? thank you for your question.
There are now 13 COVID-19 cases that have been identified in the trenton group.
There are also eight people who have been in close contact with these people.
For example, people who stay in the same room as those with COVID-19. The departure date will depend on the date at which symptoms first appeared.
and the last date when they had exposed contact with someone who had COVID-19. It's a different question for every single case.
I understand.
My other question --







**Reporter**:

What signs are you looking for in this situation is coordinated across the country and if Ottawa should or should not be stepping in.







**Reporter**:

Would you like an answer in English or french?



I have the answer.
This is an important conversation.
We are working in close collaboration with the federal government, the Prime Minister and provinces and territories like the Prime Minister said.
He will be here to dialogue.
The Prime Minister will ask provinces what they need.
I would like to highlight one other point.
This is an imminent opportunity for provinces to share information in and amongst themselves.
Canada is a very large country and our conversation and dialogue will allow premiers and the Prime Minister to determine what's happening in each province and er the.
As was the case with our conversation last week with premiers, we will talk about the possibility of using emergency measures and ask provinces what they think of this eventuality.
Do they need a stronger federal role in all of this.



**Reporter**:

Mercy.
Thank you.



Next question is from politico.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Thank you for taking My question.
You all and the Prime Minister have all said that no tool have been taken off the table including the emergencies act.
is there a chance parliament will be asked to vote for this today and Wednesday of this week when you all reconvene?



Thank you, Lauren.
It's Chrystia again.
Thement has been clear that the emergencies act is a measure of last resort that should be used only when all other tools have been exhausted.
That said, he also has been clear that everything is on the table.
and later today the meeting will be very useful in getting a clear sense of both what the situation is across the country and where the premiers feel they do or do not have the necessary tools in their own provincial and territorial tool box.



**Reporter**:

and one follow-up on the border.
Have you seen as the new restrictions on the border between Canada and the United States played out over the weekend.
Did you see any cases where further clarity may be needed.
Any problem areas or do you feel it has been rolled out pretty smoothly?



That is a great question d I don't actually have the hot line number here with me. But you will find it easily online.
CBS has very swiftly set up a hot line and a website that people can use if they are at the border.
and they feel they are engaged in essential crossing of the border.
and need some help getting across.
So please look that up and please, you know, Canadians doing essential work who meet across the border, please use that hot line to let us know if you're having difficulties.



Ok. We have time for three countries before going back to the phone.



Good afternoon.
My questions are for madame bibeau.
The first question is you said last week that there is an exemption for temporary foreign workers to come to Canada.
Most of those workers that Canadian farmers employ are coming from countries like Guatemala and the Philippines where the airports are shut or the borders are closed.
Wondering how the Canadian government actually plans to get those workers here in time for spring planting.



So, the part that falls on our government's responsibility is really to negotiate with these countries and girt Malay is a good example.
Minister champagne is engaging with his counterpart there for right to get a flight there and bring these workers.
So for the logistics around the flight and the supervision of the application of the isolation protocol, it falls under the responsibility and the coordination of farm Canada mainly.
With the support of other associations throughout the industry.



**Reporter**:

Around CIA resources, I'm wondering if there is -- we're hearing rumabilityings about concerns of the availability of the meat inspectors at Canadian plants s. There a meat inspector shortage at the moment or have there been changes to how meat inspections are being done in light of the COVID-19?



There is a challenge around human resources at cfia, mainly for our inspectors.
The whole weekend we've been working on it with the collaboration of our counterpart in the provinces and with the industry.
We're still asking the industry to help us make the priorities out of the priorities.
and we are already doing that and we will have further conversation with the provinces to see how we can share some inspectors, how we can just, you know, ease the different inspection that are normally done from the federal and sometimes slightly different from the provinces so we're really in the mode right now to finding different ways to make it easier and faster.
and we are also calling back inspectors who have retired recently.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Julie van dusen, CBC.
Ms. Hajdu, the Prime Minister said today enough is enough.
If people don't follow the rules as we've seen examples where they seem to be oblivious to social distancing and so on, could one expect the police or the army to be called in to enforce the rules?



Well, I think we've seen at every level of jurisdiction, leaders more stringently asking Canadians, in fact demanding Canadians, to take these orders seriously.
Various different jurisdictions have various different pieces of legislation that they can use to compel citizens to comply with the quarantine orders that are in place or the closures or different measures that are in place.
I think the Prime Minister has been clear that we will use every tool available and we are looking right now at stronger tools for those people coming back to the country to make sure that people understand that this is not nice to have in terms of people staying in their homes when they return from their March break or return as snow birds or various other returns to the country.
This is absolutely essential.
and yesterday I said -- I was very clear and I will say that again.
When people are coming back after international travel, it is essential that they don't stop for groceries or visit their friends or family on the way home, that they're not stopping anywhere but going directly home and doing so safely.
We are looking at ways to provide transportation for people who don't have capacity to transport themselves in a way that's private.
It is very, very important that people take this seriously.
This is a very, very serious situation.
I know we've talked a lot about the needs of vulnerable people.
But let me remind you that the greatest age percentage that we're seeing affected with coronavirus right now are working age adults and can have very serious complications as a result.
So, yes, of course, the risk of dying is much greater if you are older or you have underlying conditions.
But even for those people who are middle aged, there are significant complications for about 15% of them.
and that is way too high.
So we want people to take this seriously and we'll be looking at additional tools that we can put into place should we see no progress in the next little while.



So it possible the police or the army could be called in? that's what I want to know s. That down there as a possibility?



There are a number of ways that quarantine orders can be enforced.
Those could include random inspections.
Those could include hotlines.
There are a number of ways that these things could be enforced and looking at a different variety of measures should we take that step.



Thank you.
Rachel, CTV.



**Reporter**:

Rachel Hanson, CTV.
The first question is for either Minister hajdu or Freeland.
a lot of cit is have ordered nonessential businesses like bars, salons, spas, restaurants to close down.
is the federal government going to issue a blanket order to close all nonessential businesses now?



I'll take that answer and turn to Dr. Tam for why.
Listen, the measures that we take have to be based on the epidemiology of the particular place in which they are imposedle.
You've hear My colleagues talk about the need, for example, for essential workersful it is very important that what we do is strategic and based on the presentation of disease and what we see as the epidemiology of that disease and how it is evolving in the particular areas under theses mercks.
-- measures.
As a rule t majority of provinces and territories have confined social gatherings to under 50 and some have confined them to less than that.
Some provinces and territories have chosen to close down establishments that are considered nonessential.
In our mind, these are all very good measures.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam to tell us more about the work that she is doing at the special advisory committee on trying to coordinate that across the country.



There is absolutely consensus among the chief medical officers that people should stay at home and do social distancing as much as possible.
I think we have seen across the country, all schools are closed from kindergarten grade 12. and also in the area of mass gathering, as the Minister has said or gatherings in the description.
Some jurisdictions are very small and their capacity to deal with the situation is limited and for them, the gatherings might be lower than 50 that they would be sort of trying to prevent.
Some of My colleagues, there are, of course, a strong public health measures like quarantine acts while you can engage peace officer as part of those acts to do some of the enforcement.
I use social distancing.
For some you need to reduce your capacity by 50% in order to increase that social distancing.
and others depending on the temporary basis.
There are ways in which you can monitor whether people are complaint as well.



There are some businesses that do remain open because they aren't clear.
They are worry about having to lay off workers.
What would you tell businesses now who are still open and need more guidance?



We are maintaining guidance of maintaining social distancing, observing hygienic measures and doing all of that.
Some good examples are like grocery stores.
So providing guidance to those establishments.
Because people do have to eat and they have to go there.
Even as I was shopping this weekend, people have increased the distance between people as they line up for the cashier.
But we are providing that type of guidance to businesses.
You know, I think all of us know that this is going to take some time for us to reduce an impact and level this epidemic but essential services must continue.
Those are absolutely critical and in the other cases, depending on your local instructions on things like restaurants, but our advice in general is stop all nonessential aspects of social gathering.



and I'll just say that as we work through those essential space, one of the essential spaces that stays open is actually homeless shelters, as you know.
and just today there were guidelines posted for employees and for homeless shelters to protect their staff and to be able to protect the people that they're serving.
Clearly there are many organizations that cannot shut their door during this time.
Because they are providing an essential service to a group of people or another.
The message that Dr. Tam and I have been providing to Canadians over and over and over, if possible, work from home.
Employers, if you have a capacity to facilitate working from home, do so. and if you are, you know, on the weekend thinking of going to a restaurant and it remains open in your jurisdiction, think again and stay home.
We're asking Canadians to conduct only essential business.
Going to the grocery store, going to the post office, going to the pharmacy.
Yes, going for a walk.
But within a safe distance, six feet away from the next nearest person to you and these are the kinds of measures that we all need to be thinking about every day.
Not whether or not a particular facility remains open but whether or not we need to visit that facility for any reason.
is there another way we would get whatever it is that we need delivered to our door, for example.



Thank you.
Operator, back on the phone for three questions.



Thank you.
Merci.
We have a question, please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Yep.
To follow up on that, ministers.
There are some municipal governments requesting still today that all those workers show up for work unless they can't find a solution for, you know, taking care of their kids.
is that the right message to send when you're a governmental body?



I'll just repeat that employers should be looking for ways, when possible, to be look for people to work from home.
Regardless of what organization or sector.
There are some services that cannot be provided from home.
Bus drivers, for example, continue to provide public transit.
Although I know that many municipalities are looking at ways to make that safer for bus drivers like having people enter in the back door and ensuring that it is happening on public transit.
There are some aspects of life that need to continue AZ and I appeal to all employers, regardless of who they are, to look for ways that they can allow that you are employees to work from home and/or ensure they're using the best possible guidance to protect their workers when they are providing essential services.



As a follow-up, the Prime Minister mentioned today that there would be a publicity campaign launched some time, I don't know when.
Will you provide details as to who will be part of it, when it is launched and how much it is going to sdmo*s



I can provide some of those details and not all of them.
We will get you some that I cannot provide.
We had an initial amount of $50 million for a national media campaign.
We've been working on some of that product, but that hasn't stopped us from distributing information prior to the launch of this media campaign.
We have a number of different ways we're communicating with campaigns whether it is print in social media and print, etc.
We'll have additional messaging to Canadians la*ufrning -- launching late this week, early next.



Thank you, Merci.
The next question, please.
Your line is now open.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Minister hajdu, you were saying that the government could provide transportation for the government coming back from different places.
Can you give us more details? how does it work? how do you put that in place?



This is one of those area where is I'll quote My colleague, Minister Freeland, who said sometimes we're making decisions and planing the details afterwards.
What we're finding is that some people are obviously don't have private transportation from the airport when they're returning so we're looking at measures that we can put into place to make sure that they're not unwittingly coming into contact with other public transportation riders and we'll have more to say when we have those details sorted out.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



**Interpreter**:

a quick question for Minister bibeau.
You added $5 million to producers.
This is a loan, however, which have a difficult financial situation.
This might not be enough.
How do you think that this $5 amount will help them? the measures undertaken to help them will evolve as a situation evolves over the next few weeks.
It's essential and, therefore, has to continue.
That is why I call upon workers of the food sector.
Currently, I'm in constant contact with the industry and every single sector.
These people need oxygen.
They need flexibility.
Loan deferral is, therefore, a question of how much cash they have available to them now.
It's not extra loans, it's just a question of the fact they have to pay their inputs as quickly as possible.
But what they get paid for their outputs is slow in coming.
This is a continuation fund for them rather than new long-term substantial loans.



Thank you.
Merci.
We have a question from the "national post". please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

hi. Thank you for taking My call.
Dr. Tam, today a drug company announced it was donating one million doses of medicine to hospitals to use with COVID-19 patients experiencing respiratory distress.
However, the society of critical care medicine concluded that there's insufficient evidence to support the use of anti malaria drugs for coif.
I'm wondering your thoughts on this.
Should we be sending malaria tablets into the hospitals if the evidence to support their use is weak?



Yeah.
So absolutely we need the evidence before you can provide medication to people.
We have ideas from all over the world.
Many researches saying well, this drug might work or another drug might work.
I think Canada is part of an international effort and other international networks where they have identified a really vast suite of potential drug therapies and combinations of drugs that are already in existence that have been repurposed, if you like, for COVID-19 treatment.
So the trial that I just talked about, which is called solidarity, ran by the W.H.O., withstood that really, really fast and one of the key drugs that they will be doing a randomized clinical trial on is the malaria -- anti malarial drug and that forms one aspect of that.
Given that Canada is now part of the network, there are appropriate ways at which Canada can be engaged and make sure that our patients who are receiving these drugs are doing it in the most scientific and safest way possible.
There are mechanisms.
I also know that the regulatory authorities, health Canada, h. H.r., they are supporting these efforts in different ways of funders of research but also as regulators.
It isimperative that we prioritize the top ones that the world scientists think are important and then do proper trials.
I'm really impressed that this megatrial, if you like, globally where numerous countris can join in, is set up in such a way that makes it really, really simple to join and then the results can be analyzed in real time.
So I'm really excite about that.



**Reporter**:

and one follow-up if I can.
There are reports that Canadians are trying to hoard these tablets, much the way they did with tamiflu during the bird flu outbreak.
is this a wise thing for Canadians to be doing?



My message is that you should not take medication without the scientific evidence.
It can be quite dangerous.
These drugs are not without side effects.
In fact, they're quite significant side effects and so that people have to be really, really careful about this.
Don't do it. From a health Canada perspective, they are the regulators but they also maintain a very close link to the manufacturers and the supply and where that supply is going so there are mechanisms to actually monitor to see what the distribution looks like.
The manufacturers have been really, really responsible if they're spotting some signals that supplies are going in a certain direction, there's a mechanism set up to ensure that that doesn't actually happen.



Thank you.
We're short on time.
Two more from the room and two more from the phone.



**Reporter**:

I'm wondering if any equipment has actually gone out so far or if that is intended for later, how you are going to prioritize these requests and if you have any sorts of numbers on things going out thees door.



Dr. Tam is involved in the special advisory committee looking for both the procurement side and distribution side.



We might have to get back to you with the details because of things coming and going and there are many items on that list.
I do know that there are certain types of viral swabs for the test kit that have been distributed as well as some of the sort of other personal protective equipment.
But I don't have that specific -- those specific numbers.
But we can certainly get back to people.
Certainly we're getting more and more participation from different jurisdictions to look at a more of a bulk purchasing approach.



and just on the coordination of supplies, I've had many conversations with various ministers from across the country over the weekend as you can imagine about this very topic and it does appear that there is a reflection going on about how we best distribute those to meet the preparation needs of various jurisdictions and also the immediate needs of jurisdictions that are really struggling with particular outbreaks and we have to balance both of those.
Obviously each jurisdiction wants to be prepared but we also know that there is a somewhat of a surge in certain areas and we have to also be responsive to those needs.



and a question about data sharingful it appears there is a patchwork of data that the provinces are publishing.
David miller has said that Alberta is the only one showing us aggregate on zones, demographics, growth rates, the kind of stuff that the public needs and researchers need.
Have you asked the provinces to release more precise data and why is the dash board not that granular right now?



Yes, we have and that ask continues and we have offered resources to provinces and territories as well should there be a human resource challenge in terms of getting that data to us quickly.
That is one of the live discussions that is happening and one of the areas that I hope the mm raise with the premiers this evening.



Yeah.
I promise we'll have lots of follow-ups.
Yeah.
That is something that patty and Dr. Tam have been focused on and will be involved in the call with the premiers this afternoon.



**Reporter**:

Ok. So, we have nurses and doctors all licensed in different provinces.
They want provinces super super full of stuff and you got the doctors and nurses.
The res no beds.
Can we take nurses and doctors from other provinces? do you have the ability to do that now or what would be the situation where we could do that?



So, this is actually part of the years of pandemic planning.
We do have a framework or the operational framework on mutual aid and mutual aid agreements.
But it is up to, of course, we have different licensing bodies for different health professional groups.
But each of them have thought about emergency situations and emergency licensing.
So, that is very much part of the strategy.



**Reporter**:

a follow-up, Dr. Tam.
Actually if I have one, Dr. Freeland, there's a 50% increase in gasoline.
is that a good idea?



I think our government has been very clear that this is a time where our first priority is protecting the health and safety of Canadians and that is what everyone here has been very focused on. At the same time, we're very aware of the economic cost of fighting this virus and taking care of our health.
So that means we are thinking very carefully about our whole approach to what we're doing economically.
Both in terms of how we're supporting workers and businesses and also what we're doing on the tax side.
and you've already seen some action from the government.



Thank you.
We're going to switch back to the phone.
Two more questions and that is it.



Thank you.
a question from Emily bergeron.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi. My question is for Minister hajdu.
Yesterday you talked about making sure all the directives are uniformized.
Where are you in er thees of maybe closing the inter provincial borders.



Yesterday I talked about the need for a clear and coordinated approach.
That doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be the same everywhere.
It is based on epidemiology and the best advice of public health.
In terms of advising around the closures of inter provincial borders you know that some jurisdictions have done that based on their own particular situation and a think Dr. Tam talked about that.
In the Northwest Territories, for example, knowing that they have a vulnerable health care system and vulnerable population.
Those are ongoing with the advisory committee and I'll give Dr. Tam a few moments to speak about some of that conversation you're having around uniformity and advice to made the yafns.
-- to Canadians.



I think all of us agree around the committee and chief medical officers that the time to make a difference in terms of stopping the sort of promulgation of the virus and the spread is of paramount importance.
But we also agree nationally protecting vulnerable communities and it is an objective that we would all practice.
So that means protecting the northern territory -- the northern areas but also, of course, the territories.
Provinces and territories recognize that they are very epidemiological situations as well and there may be quite a vast area of Canada that hasn't really seen anything other than a specific introduction by travelers which is why you're seeing some of these measures being done to protect some of these areas.
There is also some underlying criteria of factors that may not be immediately obvious.
Some of these measures might be temporary because they are coping with huge numbers of people coming back, for example, to a territory at this moment in time.
Some of these measures are just to cope with the influx as well by reducing the numbers of other people who may be coming into the territories.
So, they each have very individual requirements so I think we're all very supportive of that type of approach but recognizing that we have significant concurrence around essentially all of the social distancing measures and closing down schools and reducing mass gatherings, etc.
So, I think that.
-but the other aspect that all chief medical officers were concerned about is of course maintaining essential service and making sure that the -- the support that they need.
They are fly-in, fly-out communitis that must be maintained and also the longer term impacts, whether it's mental health or other impacts.
Because if you start impacting social economic conditions that can have a severe impact on health.
It's not the kind of decisions that can be taken lightly, but I'm happy that people are decisive about how to protect their communities.
[please stands... more at risk of domestic violence and how we support families who are caught in a condo, feeling fear and pressurearound the future and the capacity to be able to support their families.
These are real and live issues we haven't forgotten about.
and we're working on every moment to help people in this very difficult time.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, one last question on the phone.



Thank you.
We have a message from "the globe and mail". the line is open.



**Reporter**:

Hello, this is a question for Dr. Tam.
The news release they say the public health agency will be working with blue dot.
Can you give us a sense of what you are looking for from the company and what information they're providing and the value of the contract?



Blue dot is a company and a colleague that we work with on an ongoing basis actually.
There is a lot of innovative thinking in terms of how the applications that they have, but also not just the tools, but the incredible amount of expertise that is behind the tools can be used.
So while some of the work has been done looking at the international spread of COVID-19, we can potentially use this tool to look at what is happening within the Canadian context.
So that's some of the areas of focus.



Follow-up. No follow-up? okay.
Thank you very much.



Before we finish, I would like to hand the floor for a few minutes for a french conclusion.
Very rapidly to give overview of the past few day's perspective when it comes to public health and epidemiology.
We all have to act.
That is the mode we mobilized Canada's industrial sector.
We have made sure that fighting this virus is also an economic fight.
This morning we've talked about social mobilization, the Prime Minister clearly stated that we -- every single one of us have a social responsibility to protect not only ourselves but our loved ones.
Today, with the announcement, we are mobilizing the agrifood sector.
Agrifood is an essential pillar of Canadian needs.
If I may finish, I would like to stay today we are particularly mobilizing the r & d sector.
We're lucky to have in Canada a world class scientific community.
That is true from coast to coast.
It's true for medic ago in quÉbecand in the greater quÉbec city area.
It's one of the jewels of the industry.
We know that they are potentially already in possession of a vaccine that could vaccinate Canadians against this coronavirus.
This is a plant-based vaccine.
What is important is that as the$300 million available for companies so they may accelerateclinical trials like Dr. Tam says, this is all essential to them to produce and distribute this vaccine large scale.
We have to flatten the curve, but once again, our announcements are coherent, are consistent, so we have all the tools necessary to take care of ourselves and of all Canadians.
Thank you.



That is our regular briefing from cabinet ministers part of the COVID-19 cabinet committee giving us an update on different measures the government is taking today.
For instance, $5 billion being made available to the more than 250, 000 farmers in the country to make sure they have enough credit going forward to produce food, to shore up our food supply.
Also projects announced to help discovery and the creation of vaccines for COVID-19. But essentially, the message today, both from Dr. Tam, who said we must be unrelenting in our social distancing and from Canada's Prime Minister, enough is enough, said Justin Trudeau.
It is important now that you stay home and you start practising social distancing andself-isolating.
a reminder that the Prime Minister will speak with premiers later today to see if they need stronger measures fromthe federal government to help enforce this.
Parliament returns tomorrow to pass critical legislation to getcanadians financial aid they need so much.
We have lots of briefings from provinces continuing through theafternoon.
We're going to quÉbec city now where premier francois legault is providing an update on the coronavirus in that province.
I'm rosemary barton.
Thanks for watching.
Here's the premier now.



**Translator**:
