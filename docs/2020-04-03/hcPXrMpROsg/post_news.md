**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau updating Canadians again on the COVID-19 pandemic, using some of his strongest language yet, appealing to Canadians again to practice self-isolation and social distancing.
Saying that if you choose to ignore the advice of public health officials and government officials, you are putting yourself and others at risk, that you need to make the right choice and in a very stern tone, saying enough is enough.
You need to go home and stay home.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane.
So, certainly this is -- to me this sounded like, you know, this is the last warning here before we have to take things up a no. and certainly we know he is going to speak to the premiers about that later today.
I'll start with you, Vassy.







**Vassy**:

a couple of things I would highlight is the language today.
I've been talking to a number of people around the Prime Minister during that press conference.
Each of them unequivocally told me that is the final warning, the language that was used today to signal to Canadians.
It soufns like they are very close to moving in some capacity in that direction.
I don't know exactly how.
I'm not even sure if they have made those decisions.
But they were as frustrated by those images of people congregating in public places over the weekend as other government officials like the premier of Nova Scotia, as David highlighted earlier, was as well.
He said we've all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they're invincible.
Well, you're not.
Enough is enough.
Go home and stay home.
It couldn't be more clearer than that.
Even though there were announcements mixed in with this, such as help with farmers and vaccines.
Certainly you could tell and every message seemed to pivot to this -- that was the aim of the press conference today to get across to Canadians the behaviours of the past two days of a number of people in this country, that congregation in public spaces, is just not producing a good effect t. It's not conducive to the kind of end goal that everyone has when it comes to the spread of this disease.
and it sounds as though, I think, and from the conversations that I'm having that they are prepared to take additional steps.
Notice that there was even a question for our Olivia stefanovich around closing provincial borders.
The Prime Minister didn't say no. He said yep, I'm talking about stuff like that with the premiers later today.
I think it is a very specific shift in tone and one to note as well.



**Rosemary**:

This is, just so people understand, this is critically important right now as we see the number of cases go up. But we probably won't see the results of this mes an ding for another seven to 10 days as we heard from Dr. Tam and patty haj, the u. I would also say that the Prime Minister made it clear that he'd rather not go down the road that we're talking about here.
I don't think any democracy or any government wants to suspend civil little -- liberties in any way.
It's not just about protecting your health and other people's health.
It's about protecting your personal freedoms and the choices you are making.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
We might not see the results of the social distancing measures in the data for a couple of weeks, but we may see changes in behaviours right away.
After gatherings in the park and Stephen McNeil and the Prime Minister said things like when My dad used to say that I knew I was in trouble.
[laughter]and listening is your duty and staying home is your way to serve.
So, mobilizing Canadians to pull together by staying apart.
Some specific measures on fighting the virus and also helping people deal with the fallout of this from the Prime Minister today.
There are companies working on vaccine development.
Also to the university of Saskatchewan and to the national research council facility in montreal to help ramping up or scaling of mass production of a vaccine once an acceptable and safe one is identified and working with software companies to help track and identify where the disease is going.
and a call to post-secondary institutes to turn over any surplus masks or ventilators you might have and, hey, do you have a 3d printer we could use to produce the medical supplies? because the market is flooded with buyers and short of supplies right now so we need to build that domestic capacity.
The other bit of news, some more information on the $5 billion in extra credit for farmers and more information on flights.
Three for from peru, two more from more rock coaxer air Canada to spain and charters to guatemala, ecuador and el salvador.
The international repatriation efforts as the government continues piece by piece to respond to this entire thing.
You know, and I wonder, rosey, signaling -- the Prime Minister tends to give answers in these things that signal where things may go in the next 24 to 48 hours.
This conversation with the premiers could very well be critical in terms of clamping down in a massive, massive way.
He talked about the quarantine act t emergency measures act.
That conversation will happen at 5:30, 6:00 eastern and that could start a whole new phase of this response.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. I'm going to leave it there if you don't mind because Kennedy staour t mayor of Vancouver, is injoing us now and it was Mr. Stewart yesterday who saw the pictures of what was happening in his city and you also had harsh words for your citizens yesterday.
Can I start by just getting your reaction about what you hear from the Prime Minister?



I think that is exactly the tone that needs to happen and I really have to commend the federal government for what they've done so far.
It's filling us with confidence that they're getting the problem and they're doing everything they can to help us. My day starts early trying to get the latest information.
and I'm sure that is happening in Ottawa as well.



**Rosemary**:

What was happening in the city over the past number of days that made you drop the hammer yesterday.



We're a city like everybody else, but we have the unique situation in our downtown east side where we have 10, 000 vulnerable people homeless or living in shelters so they're extremely vulnerable and all very concerned about this.
Until now, we've been asking nicely for people to distance themselves, stay home, where possible.
Over the weekend, I saw people playing soccer and having picnics and on the basketball courts playing hockey.
I was a nice day.
Playing beer pong.
I said to council we have to act.
We have emergency powers now.
and so we have -- we have to extend them today and I'm hoping that they will help.



**Rosemary**:

What's the result of that, if you see people outside not following public health advice.
What are the consequences?



We've already done this with numerous businesses.
We issued orders and we don't want anyone spreading this COVID-19 so we can fine them now up to $50, 000 if they don't comply.
But can we actually -- we're going to give ourselves the power to break up, you know, to have people stay at home and fine people if they're congregating in large groups but we the cheats er as -- but we have the charter.



**Rosemary**:

is there anything you'd like to see from that conversation about what needs to happen nationally or is this something you think you can get a handle on locally?



I think 95% of people on Vancouver are complying and they have been great.
It's just the health Minister, Adrian Dix, said yesterday we need 100% compliance.
It's really the people around the margins that aren't complying that are a big concern.
and, of course, other municipalities are probably having the same thing.
So, we have our own Vancouver charter and the ability to do this.
So we're give, ourselves the power today in council and we'll move ahead if others don't. The key thing is not to worry so much about, you know, your day-to-day life, but making sure we keep people safe.
People should be able to look themselves in the mirror and said I did everything I could to help out, to pitch in and right now there is a number of people who can't say that.
We all need to be able to say that.



**Rosemary**:

a good message to end it on. Good luck with things out there.
We appreciate it.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

That is Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart.
We also heard there from the Prime Minister about more efforts to repatriate Canadians.
Three additional flights have been announced from Peru alone and we reached Chris turiram in Peru.
I hope I said your last name right.
How are you doing?



That is correct.
Much better now with the recent news from the Prime Minister.
Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

What do you know about these three additional flights? what have you been told?



All we know is there are three flights and the first one is going to Lima.
We don't know if there is one coming or we have to take a bus that is 48 hours from here because everything will be closed.
We are getting pieces and bits of information and 50% is like [inaudible], quote-unquote.
Hard to keep up with what's real and what's not.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.
Anytime you get a text from the government, they are texting people and people freak out because it is unusual, but they are sending you texts.
I spoke to another lady a couple of days ago there and she said, Chris, that it does take a while to get to an international airport.
I think there is one slightly closer than Lima, though.
So you don't know yet whether there will be a flight closer than that.



We don't know for sure.
We were told there will be two airports operational in Peru and the second one will be where we are.
That is the general news we're getting.



**Rosemary**:

I understand --



I'm packed and waiting to leave.



**Rosemary**:

Good.
I understand that you have some underlying health conditions that make it urgent that you get back here.



That is correct.
I'm h. I.v. Positive and I'm antiretroviral and today I was scheduled to go home today.
Today was the end of My holiday.
Unfortunately last Monday when the peruvian government shut down everywhere and gave us 24 hours, we were like some 48 hours away.
We dropped everything and took a private taxi, which cost us $500 United States to get here.
Once we were here, we could not get out because the army men were all over and you could not leave without a special permit without some kind of government agency of your country.
So, yes.
Now we've still been here for a week.
I do have My medication.
So I have an extra medication for a week.
That was My biggest concern.
I have My pharmacies here.



**Rosemary**:

If you were to have to go beyond a week, how troubling would that be for your health?



For me that would be death because right now because of the way medications are advanced now, I've been undetectable for My whole h. I.v. Life.
and that is what caused moe MO not be on the undetectable anymore.
When you are undetectable, you cannot transmit the virus.
That would be the first thing.
I could transmit the virus.
The second thing is I'm open to all kinds of opportunistic infections and the top one right now and scariest is the COVID-19. So, that really troubles me.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Three flights over the course of the next week.
I would hope and imagine you get on one of them, that's what I hope for you.
Thank you for speaking to us, Chris.
Appreciate it.



Can I I speak one last -- I hope that I'm a little bit more priority than the privileged kids who are here on a school tour.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Message receiveded.
Chris, we'll touch back with you if you don't mind.
Thank you.



Thank you.
You are doing a great job, rosey.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you.
Chris is in Peru, hoping to get out over the course of the next week.
Before I bring us to the ministers two will be speaking at the top of the hour, let's go to Dr. Peter Lin, a CBC news medical contributor.
He joins us now.
I wanted you to weigh in, if you can, on that important message, that very stern message from the Prime Minister today.
In terms of social distancing and self-isolating.
How important was it to hear that and using that tone from him right now.



Yeah.
What we're seeing in terms of cases is there is travel, close contact and then there is pending.
Which en moos we don't know where these people got the VA recess from which means that the virus may be on the beach with those people so close together.
and I think the reason why people are going out is because they're saying I feel fine and the people who go to a beach are healthy so they're not sick people so they won't come out to the beach.
I'm fine to be with them and I'm young so therefore, all the news is about old people so therefore they forgot that the first doctor in china was a young 35-year-old eye specialist who died from the virus.
He was the first one to report it and so young people do die.
The problem with the virus is you don't have to be coughing or sneezing, you still produce enough virus that if I'm close enough to you, I can breathe the air and, therefore, get the virus into My lungs.
This is something that people don't understand.
People say I was at a small party, 10 people.
Nobody was coughing or sick and now I've got COVID-19. That is the stuff we need to hear as opposed to police officers arresting everybody.
I don't think we want that.
We don't want drones out there trying to police the roads and hopefully people will get that message that healthy-looking people can still pass the virus and that is why the six-foot distance so important.



**Rosemary**:

There is, with youth, there is a spirit of invincibility.
You do think nothing bad is ever going to happen to you.
If there is now a time to think about -- and this is what the Prime Minister was trying to make the point today -- it is not actually even about you.
It's about anyone else that you could infect and how you move forward knowing that that happened and you may have been responsible for that.



Yeah.
So what happens is let's say that person went to the beach and she picked it up. They come home and then they infect the family.
So whenever we see travel-related and close contact -- whenever we see close contact, it means that one person infected the family so that is why I'm also nervous about all the repatriation planes coming back because we'll bring back a lot of virus.
We need to make sure that the message goes out to them as to how to self-isolate properly.
Otherwise, one patient will become five patients and when Dr. Tam talked about flattening the curve, we want to talk about that one person becoming one partly cloudy and that's how we flatten the curve.
I wrote an e-mail myself could you have the stewardists go through a list of things.
Go home.
Don't take public transport.
Do not stop at a shopping mall to get stuff.
Have other people deliver this stuff for you.
Family members.
and maybe when you get home, you shower and wash everything and wash all your clothesful put your suitcase something elsewhere it's safe.
The virus will die in six or seven days on its own and keep that six or a seven-foot radius in the home.
In italy, you don't see anybody on the streets and yet their numbers are continuing to climb.
So, why are they getting sick? it's not from strangers, it's from within the family.
We can take out that family transmission or home transmission, then we can save at least 70% of the cases.
In china, it was about 70% of the cases happening within the home.
Self-isolation needs to be done to contain the virus to the one person and not let it spread outward.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Lin, do appreciate that very much.
Dr. Peter Lin is a CBC news medical contributor.
We'll speak with you again.
I've got about a minute left before we say good-bye to vaoers on the main network and go to the ministers press conference.
Vassy, something then that we should watch from the ministers here.
More details on how some of this money will be doled out to companis from Minister bain.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I think building on what we've been hearing over the past hour from the Prime Minister, some specifics about exactly how far they're prepared to go. What could they employ if, in fact, enforcement is the road they want to go down.
When they talk about the emergencies act, what context are they happening now? as a last resort broadly speaking but what might be part of the discussion when it comes to invoking the emergencies act with the premiers later today.
They will be pushed on those details certainly.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
Great.
Thank you for joining us here on CBC news network.
An update on where things are at. Three more flights from Peru have been authorized and are scheduled this week.
But more flights from other countries.
Morocco, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador.
and the Prime Minister really using strong language.
His strongest tlaong date to say to Canadians you need to stop socializing and need to self-isolate and he is telling people you are not invincible.
Enough is enough.
Go home and stay home.
He has a call with premiers later today and we'll see whether that message today was enough for premiers and for all of Canada.
I'm rosemary barton.
You've been watching special cbc programming here on cbc main network and you can continue to watch on cbc news network and cbc.
Ca. Thank you.
Hello and welcome from wherever you are joining us. You are watching our ongoing cbc news live special on the coronavirus pandemic and of course streaming around the world on cbc.
Ca. I know there are lots of Canadians overseas looking to get information.
a stern and perhaps final warning even today from Prime Minister justin trudeau on the social distancing and self-isolation directive.
The Prime Minister using the strongest language we have heard yet.
To try and finally get that message across to Canadians saying enough is enough.
Warning people to do their part, keep their distance or governments will have to enforce it. We'll talk about all this this hour and take you live to the briefing by the COVID-19 cabinet team.
a number of ministers and the public health officials will speak with us and speak to Canadians shortly as well.
In the Prime Minister's address earlier, he said the government is investing in research aimed at developing a possible COVID-19 vaccine, but that takes time.
Trudeau says Canadians can help buy that time by staying home as much as possible and he said the government was willing to take steps to make it happen.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Social distancing, physical distancing is the single best way to keep the people around you safe.
What does that mean? it means keeping two metres between yourself and someone else.
It means avoiding groups.
It means staying home as much as possible.
If you choose to ignore that advice, if you choose to get together with people or go to crowded places, you're not just putting yourself at risk, you're putting others at risk, too.
We've all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they're invincible.
Well, you're not.
Enough is enough.
Go home and stay home.
This is what we all need to be doing.
and we're going to make sure this happens, whether by educating people more on the risks whereby enforcing the rules if that's needed.
Nothing that could help is off the table.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister speaking to Canadians just in the last hour with really his strongest message to date to try to get Canadians to listen without governments having to enforce.
He was asked during his press conference whether any province had yet requested the federal government to invoke the emergencies act and he says that is not the case.
There a series of measures under that act, that piece of legislation and the quarantine act that the government could bring into effect in order to fine people or arrest people.
So things are serious and the message from the Prime Minister today was a serious one as well.
Let's bring in the host of "power & politics" Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane as we stand by and wait for the cabinet ministers to come and bring us a briefing.
I thought I should update people on the state of legislation for people who are waiting for additional funds.
Parliament to be recalled tomorrow, David.
So that will happen really quickly and with very few people inside the house of commons.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, in and out.
Even the green party will be able to make it. We thought yesterday they wouldn't. But the new M.P. will drive from New Brunswick to be here.
There are private planes going across the country.
Government planes to bring in the necessary M.P.s to pass this $82 billion aid package or the components of it that require legislative authority.
So, that is going to be quick in and out.
Not a lot of drama.
Dramatic and unusual session of the house of commons and dramatic and unusual time.
But no great level of uncertainty like we're seeing south of the border, for example.
Whether bipartisan squabbling is going to lead to a cancellation of one aid package and bickering back and forth.
There is absolutely no evidence of that happening here.
You know, we heard the strong message from the Prime Minister.
He's fed up. He said enough is enough.
People need to stay home that.
Will either sort itself out by changing their behavior or by the government changing it for them through extreme means.
We're hoping to hear from navdeep Bains, the industry Minister.
Last week we got an announcement from him where he is working with three companies to make masks, vent lays tier and test kits.
Those were all at the letter of intent phase and there is some anxiousness to get those ramp ed up. While the social behaviour will take care of itself, the oncoming run on medical suppl is will not.
and the procurement Minister searching the globe and the country to buy supplies wherever she can is building what they hope will be enough for the first big waves of COVID-19 in Canada.
Navdeep Bains has to make sure there's a permanent domestic solution.
