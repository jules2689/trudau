### Summary:



I want to begin by recognizing that a lot of people have been stuck at home for a week or more because of COVID-19.
Social distancing, physical distancing is the single best way to keep the people around you safe.
It means staying home as much as possible.
If you choose to ignore that advice, if you choose to get together with people or go to crowded places, you're not just putting yourself at risk.
We've all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they're invincible and enough is enough.
Go home and stay home.
and we're going to make sure this happens, whether by educating people more on the risks or by enforcing the rules if it's kneed.
It is your duty and staying home is your way to serve.
Every day there are more and more people who step up and heed this call.
I know this is heartbreaking for so many people.
For farmers and people across the agri food business, I know these are hard times, too.
Starting today, farmers and producers can apply through farm credit Canada for the support they need to keep food growing and getting it on to our tables.
On that note, I want to say thank you to people across the entire food sector.
We're working together to make sure everyone has what they need, whether that's equipment for testing or medical supplies.
This evening t premiers and I will also talk about continuing to move forward with measures to support families and small businesses to ensure our economy rebounds.
For Canadians stranded abroad, we're working with airlines to get people home.
People should be returning by commercial means while they're still available.
As of today, we secured authorizations for air Canada to operate three flights for this week for Canadians in peru and there will be two more flights in the coming days from morocco.
We're investing in a long-term solution to COVID-19 right here at home.
We will be working with a vancouver-based company to develop a drug to prevent and treat COVID-19. We're also working with a Quebec city-based company for vaccine testing and production.
and luckily, we have the tools we need right here at home.
Blue dot in toronto was among the first in the world to identify the spread of COVID-19 coming in nine days ahead of the world health organization's public warning.

As we said on vaccines, we have moved forward on investing in a number of companies to accelerate their movement toward clinical trials and eventual production of a vaccine.
We're working with labs across the country to accelerate the arrival of testing results as well.
We are looking at technological and concrete solutions that will accelerate this process because we recognize that mass testing is a key part of the path forward.




We know there are significant pressures on Canadians across the country who are facing bills coming in, facing pressures on caring for their families.
That is why we are working extremely quickly to get money out the door, into the pockets of Canadians during this extraordinary time.
What we're working through, including with the stem of recalling parliament tomorrow is a legislative package that will allow us to move forward even quicker on getting money into pockets of Canadians who need it across the country.
But every step of the way, if we see that measures aren't being taken up properly, that aren't being followed, we will look at different measures that could be necessary to enforce these rules.
We'd rather not and we know that millions of Canadians are doing their part.
But those who are not doing their part are putting at risk everyone else, including the eventual recovery of our economy and the well-being of millions of Canadians.
We're impressing upon Canadians to do this of their own will, to understand that individuals can and must do their part to keep us all safe and to ensure that we come through this in the best way possible.



I will be speaking with the premiers about measures that we can take to move forward and I look forward to that conversation.



As many people are, I'm listening to the advice of experts.
But certainly I am going to make sure that we continue to follow all recommendations of public health officers, particularly around staying at home, wherever possible and self-isolation.



I think people need to get the message that this isn't just about them.
This is about health workers who are on the front lines trying to keep us all safe.
Canadians can and must do their part to keep us all safe.
When we see images of people out enjoying the sunshine in large groups, that is extremely concerning because they are not just putting themselves at risk, they are putting everyone else at risk.
Every single Canadian has a responsibility to engage in keeping their distance and staying home whenever possible and ensuring those who have to go home for essential services and keep us healthy and alive and fed are not at risk themselves.







and staying home for their safety to watch other people out there putting not just themselves at risk but everyone who is staying home at risk as well.
