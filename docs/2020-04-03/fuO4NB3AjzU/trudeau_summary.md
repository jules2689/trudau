### Summary:



Before we get going, I want to recognize that earlier today the province of Ontario announced a provincial state of emergency. Ontario is taking the right steps to protect people and the health care system.
On that note, I want to recognize all of the people on the front lines of our health care system.
I know that all Canadians are grateful.
I also want to thank all of the retired health care workers putting up their hand to come back and take care of Canadians.
These measures, and especially social distancing, are how we can ease the burden on our doctors and nurses so they can focus on our fellow Canadians who need it the most.
But we all must take all action through social distancing to protect our health and the health of others.
As the situation with COVID-19 continues to grow, our government will keep taking action, too.
Canadians abroad in need of emergency assistance can always call 1-613-996-8885 or e-mail sos@international. This comes as we announce that we're closing our air borders to people who aren't Canadian citizens or permanent residents with some exceptions like for aircrew and United States citizens.
We are hard at work to create the right support package for Canadians while protecting people's jobs and our economy.
and tomorrow, we'll be making another major announcement on economic actions to support Canadians as quickly as possible.
We are looking at giving more flexibility for people to make payments and for businesses to have more liquidity during this time.
There are economic pieces that will need quick passage through the house in order to support Canadians.
We are also examining the emergency measures act to see if it is necessary or if there are other ways that will enable us to take the actions needed to protect people. and a number of methods to get money into the pockets of Canadians.
We are also separately looking at the emergency measures act to see if there are tools that they offer us that allow us to do more things that are needed for Canadians that can't be done other ways.




We have taken significant measures up until this point.
We will continue to take necessary measures.
We will continue to look at what we can do at the federal level to keep Canadians safe.
Everything that needs to be done to keep Canadians safe is being done.
For our businesses, for Canadians who are worried.
Whether it's making sure that small businesses can remain viable through this difficult time, whether it's so that families can take care of their loved ones and put food on the table.
We will make sure that Canadians are able to hold through this difficult time.
That is what Canadians do.
That is why we are taking extra measures to ensure that indigenous people across this country remain safe.
We took responsible decisions to keep Canadians safe, including measures at the airport, as issues started to happen in wuhan and in china and that was able to keep Canadians safe as we saw a very low incidents of spread of the virus in Canada, even though we didn't do what other countries did and closed the border because we followed the recommendations of our public health officials and we were able to control the spread of the virus from the very beginning.
and we are continuing to do and will continue to do everything that is needed, every step of the way to protect Canadians.
Of course, Canadians should look to as much social distancing as possible.
They should look to take measures that keep themselves and their families and their neighbourhoods safe while not overburdening our public health system.
These are the things that Canadians must do and we'll continue to keep people informed on the best ways to keep Canadians safe.




We are looking at every possible way of bringing Canadians home.
There are three million Canadians at any given moment around the world living and working and I think it is just realistic to know that some of them will not be coming home in the coming weeks.
But we will make measures available to global affairs Canada to make sure as many Canadians as possible, as many Canadians as want to can come home.
This is something that all Canadians are respecting of their government and we will be doing it.
It's a way of enact acing measures that otherwise would not be able to be enacted.
So, we're looking at the emergency act to look at what those measures are, that it would make available and whether there are other ways, without having to bring in a state of emergency, that we could invoke them.
and on the cost of the measures, Canada has taken responsible fiscal decisions over the past years that have allowed us to have a significant troop maneuver on investing in our economy. Ratio, the lowest deficit as -- debt as a proportion of the size of our economy and that allows us to invest significantly in Canadians, in businesses, to make sure who are able to make it did through this difficult time and make sure we're able to prosper and grow once we're through this moment.
