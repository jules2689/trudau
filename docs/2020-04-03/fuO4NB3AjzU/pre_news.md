We are waiting today, again, for the Prime Minister to address the country for the third time since his self-isolation.
I'm rosemary barton here in the nation's capital.
Let's take a look live now at Rideau cottage.
That is the Prime Minister's official residence here in waolt.
Justin trudeau on the phone for most of this morning as a his cabinet COVID-19 committee also met.
He is expected to really emphasize the importance of social distancing.
What we've been talk about now -- talking about now for a number of weeks but the message really ramped up in the last couple of days as a way to contain and mitigate the spread of this virus.
He will also, we are expect in the address, some of the new restrictions at the border which does not apply to americans.
This morning, there was an announcement out of the most populous province in this country and that, of course, is Ontario.
There are eight new case of COVID-19 here in Ontario.
That brings the provincial total to 185.
The highest in this country.
Five of those cases have been resolved so far.
But earlier this morning, Ontario premier doug ford announced a state of emergency, making it now the second province to do so. The premier says it's an attempt to, again, help stop the spread.



We're facing an unprecedented time in our history.
This is a decision that was not made lightly.
COVID-19 constitutes a danger of major proportions.
We're taking this measure because we must offer our full support and every power possible to help our health care sector fight the spread of COVID-19.



**Rosemary**:

So this is just the latest province to do that.
To confirm for you, at last count, we have 449 preassumed or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this country.
and we still are at four deathsful all of them in northern Vancouver, British Columbia, related to an elderly care centre.
The cbc's Meagan Fitzpatrick joins me now, though, from Ontario's legislature.
Let's start here, Meagan, as we wait for the Prime Minister because this was a significant announcement today in Ontario.
Though many people still wondering what does it mean concretely? can you spell that out for us a little bit?



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Let's go through sort of what's now opened and closed in this province, rosemary.
For starters, the premier did announce part of these measures include no more gatherings of 50 people or more in public spaces and so any events planned, parades, for example, canceled.
He also said that includes gatherings within places of worship.
Now it means a lot for businesses in this province.
Restaurants and bars closed effective immediately.
They can only stay open if they're providing takeout or delivery service.
and libraries will be closed in this province.
Recreation centres, licensed daycares, private schools have been ordered to close.
We know that public schools have been told to close for two weeks after this week's March break.
Theaters are closed, performing arts centres, movie theatre as well.
What remains open, essential services are still operating, premier ford said.
Pharmacies open, grocery stores open, malls are still open.
Though we do know a lot of retail chains have proactively decided to close their stores but offices can remain open as well as factories and public transit is still operating as well, rosemary.
I heard him say in this clip that it is not a decision that the government took mightly.
He said he was talking to his cabinet late last night and early this morning.
He did make this decision based on the advice of his chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams.
As part of press conference, too, just to note because there is likely a lot of worried workers in this province based on today's news, what it means for them and what it means for small business owners and he did talk about a relief package that will be offered by the government.
$300 million is being dedicated to the COVID-19 response so far.
Some of that money coming from the federal government.
Some of it coming from provincial coffers.
Some of the money is already dedicated to front line health care, though, in this province.
He was talking about buying more pro eke thieve -- protective equipment and support for businesses and workers in this province, more to come on that in the coming days.
He says that his ministers are in touch with their federal counterparts and likely more measures announced in conjunction in the days ahead.
But he did urge the federal government to hurry up and reform the e. I. system.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. great.
Meagan Fitzpatrick, we'll come back live to you.
We appreciate that.
We're standing by right now to hear from the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, for the third time since he had to self-isolate because his wife has tested positive for COVID-19. So he is in there doing his work with his wife and three kids around him.
He did, however, give a couple of interviews this morning and to look into those a little bit.
Talk about those as we wait for him to emerge in just a few minutes' time, I'm told.
Vassy kapelos, the host of "power & politics", is standing by with me here in ottawa.
He did this morning talk a little bit more about those economic measures that meagan alluded to, and that is important.
It sounds like an announcement is likely tomorrow.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, it sounds like he indicated -- I think yesterday he said as early as today.
But My understanding from speaking with a couple of people surrounding him is that they have a few more details to work out so they do anticipate making that announcement tomorrow.
a lot of big questions around something as simple as the tax deadline, for example.
Will that be extended considering that is just around the corner, two weeks away.
There is also that ask that Meagan was talking about, not just from the premier of Ontario, but heard it from the premier of British Columbia and the premier of Alberta.
Lots of different provinces.
They are looking for help with e. I., either expanding the programme, changing the criteria, different payments for different people.
Will there be direct payments to individuals in this instance as well? he said essentially that everything is on the table and that is among the things they're considering and trying to work out.
Those e. I. questions, though, the tax questions are the more immediate ones that need to be answered tomorrow and then businesses as well.
When you see the province of Ontario with that state of emergency, clearly giving instructions and orders that carry penalties if they're not followed to businesses to shut down in certain instances, to only operate, for example, with restaurants and via delivery and takeout.
That has very serious economic consequences, not just for the workers but the people who run the businesses.
Though they did make an announcement last week that involved more lending capacity for banks and more credit made available to the tune of $10 billion through the export development bank, for example, the business development bank, businesses will be looking for more and provinces have indicated that they will need more for those businesses.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
He hinted at allowing e. I. for those qualified.
He talked about more money for businesses and that would probably be small and medium-sized businesses as opposed to large corporations.
He hinted at mortgage help, which we've seen in other countries, even this morning france going as far as to say it will pay bills for people if needed and some child benefits or increase of where the child benefit is. But today is not really about that.
Today is an entirely different message.
But almost as critical, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
Definitely, rosey.
and today's message I'm told -- I know our colleagues have been told as well -- very much about reinforcing what Dr. Tam said yesterday and that is the message around social distancing.
We've been hearing it quite a bit.
But it's sort of escalated over the past few days.
Don't get together, for example, with more than 50 people.
No events for more than 50 people.
Perhaps they will go further than that, I don't know at this point, but reinforcing that message.
We also -- and I know you'll touch on this.
But heard during another one of his interviews about the border and you did say that that might be part of the discussion today, the restrictions at the border.
Canadians who have symptoms and not being allowed to come into canadament he said today in one of those interviews that there will be people who can't come home.
I imagine he is going to get a lot of questions about that.
How many people do they anticipate, under what circumstances? it is a very -- his tone yesterday and the message yesterday as well as in those interviews a very serious one to people who are abroad right now.
Certainly one that the government wants those people to be listening to. Getting home, though, right now, I think the reality of it is and the Prime Minister indicated, is not going to be easy and may, in some instances, be impossible.
I'll be looking to see him expand on those statements as well.



**Rosemary**:

We have a two-minute warning.
and why it also might be complicated to get home.
Westjet says it is suspending all commercial and international and transborder flights far 30-day period, starting Sunday.
So, that makes it difficult.
and numbers that we just got, too, shows that there is more than 400, 000 Canadians registered with global affairs in different countries.
That is not a complete list.
Of course, it doesn't mean that all those people will want to come home.
But that is the kind of numbers we're talking about.
and just anecdotically, the number of people reaching out on Twitter to say they're stuck, I have dozens and dozens.
Here's the Prime Minister to address Canadians again.
Let's bring that to you now live.
The Prime Minister of Canada.
