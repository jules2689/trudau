**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Canadians are getting very different messages from province and from you and from cities.
They are varying from gatherings under 10 people to 50 people and I'm wondering if you are worried that Canadians are getting mixed messages.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From all governments is very, very similar.
Stay at home as much as you possibly can.
Engage in social distancing.
Look to care for your loved ones and don't go out unless you absolutely have to. The various recommendations will be suitable to various jurisdictions, but we are coordinating very closely across jurisdictions to ensure that Canadians go -- get this message that it is time to stay home as much as possible.



**Caller**:

Thank you.
Merci.
The next question,  please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Oui.
Good afternoon.




**Interpreter**:

Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
I'd like to come back to the issue of the United States border.
You said you haven't made any decision because you don't want to disrupt supply chains.
What is the difference between cargo coming in and could you please clarify your position on this? it looks like you're waiting for Donald trump to say it's Ok. No, we are, in fact, trying to co-ordinate our actions with the United States authorities because we have a high level of integration and when it comes to our supply chains and our economies.
But we will always take the best measures for Canadians.
and we will be looking very carefully at what we need to do in the next few steps.
We took the necessary measures every step of the line and we will continue to announce more as we go along.
Based on science and the recommendations of experts.
Merci.



Thank you.
Merci.
Please press star 1 if you have a question.
 the first question is from marieke Walsh from the "globe and mail". please go ahead.



**Caller**:

Hi, there.
Thank you.
I'm wondering if you could? speak specifically to the emergencies act.
What specific powers are you strongly reviewing and why?



Thank you.
Well, I'll provide you with two pieces of advice.
The first one, as the Prime Minister said, just this morning, we are considering the use of the emergency measure act and the objective being that we want to be prepared to assist the important work of provinces and territories and, therefore n that context, all cabinet ministers are [inaudible] rapidly to engage with their counterparts to see if this is an avenue that will make us even more effective in working with they will and supporting their important work in the context of this crisis.
The second thing is that the act says basically that we can use that law to either regulate the movement of people, the movement of goods and restrictions to that movement and that implies, therefore, possible restrictions on travel, evacuations of people t provision of essential goods and services in the context of the emergency situation in which we are currently finding ourselves.



Yes.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



If I could add one money thing.
-- could add one thing.
We're very aware that the emergency services act is a measure of last resort, which does grant extraordinary powers to the federal government.
We began a discussion of it today and we're also very aware as he has just explained that ET could never be invoked without consultation with the provinces.



**Reporter**:

Can you please clarify? we're hearing mixed messages, from My understanding, who can come home? you're saying everybody can come home.
But at the same time, you're saying people who are ill or have symptoms can't get on the plane.
So, can you clarify that for everybody?



Yes.
What the d. P.m. Said is that all Canadians can come home and by Canadians we include permanent residents and we also include immediate family and immediate family members.
What the clarification is, if a person is symptomatic, they will not be allowed to come home until their symptoms are treated wherever they happen to be. and that is why we have also announced that there will be some financial help as they get through that difficult period and eventually are able to come home.







**Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question is from Laura osmond with the Canadian press.
Please go ahead.




**Reporter**:

Hi, there.
Sorry for the delay.
We have a number of questions about flattening the curve.
Right now you're trying to make sure that people socially distance and flatten that curve so it doesn't go above sort of the line for what our health care system can handle.
What is happening now to sort of make that line go higher, to increase the capacity of our health care system?



Thank you.
It's patty hajdu.
I'll answer that and turn it over to Dr. Tam.
That work has been happening to prepare our health care system since the very early days since we noticed increased activity in Wuhan and Dr. Tam immediately called a meeting or convening, if you will, of a special committee that includes public health officers from all across the provinces and territories to begin that planning.
Of course, in the early days it was very unclear how serious this would be for Canada, but we knew should we see any outbreak in Canada and god forbid where we find ourselves now in a full pandemic, that our health care system would need to be fortified and provinces and territories need to be taking appropriate steps to do that work.
I will also indicate that the committee that Dr. Tam convened is not just the public health officers, but there are several committees that work on that technical aspect of that preparation, including what kinds of equipment and human resourcing concerns and a number of other measures.
and so we have been working with provinces and territories to boost our capacities and to understand what kinds of demands would be placed on the health care system if we were to see the same type of curve we were seeing first in china and later in Italy and Iran.
I'll turn it over to Dr. Tam to talk about some of those specifics.



Yeah.
It's actually quite incredible across the country to hear from every province and territory, how they're planning to ready the health system.
So, some of the measures that they're taking include already invoking response plans in ho*ement facilities.
-- in health facilities.
They are reducing any foil impact on those very valuable hospital assets and hospital beds.
They are using telemedicine in a way that I feel to be maybe a legacy of the outbreak itself is the fact that people are using innovations to try and get care to people in different ways.
They are doing consultations remotely.
What you are trying to do is reduce the ounce of capacity in the health care system to treat those who have more serious presentations of the COVID-19. We see assessmentle toos for people who come from travel, for instance, who maybe don't need to be looked at in a clinic so you don't inundate those systems as well is also at play.
As well, we're readying all the systems.
The labl systems, the surveillance systems, protecting our health workers very important.
Collaborating on getting equipment, which includes the purchasing, for example, of ventilators.
So, all of those things together help improve and increase that line that you saw where you want to get that curve under, of course, with that line on the upward trajectory.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
and for deputy Prime Minister, we got a previous [inaudible] of the economic measures that were going to be announced tomorrow.
But what kinds of things are your committee considering, considering a lot of economic supports tend to be things that get people spending money and that is not necessarily appropriate right now as people are staying home more and not going out into the community as much.



So first of all, the Prime Minister has foreshadowed that we will be unveiling Minister morneau will be unveiling some further strong economic measures.
I would never steal his thunder, but let me assure everyone that we understand the seriousness of this situation and the federal government absolutely understands that we need to do and we will do whatever it takes to ensure that our economy can weather the storm.
This is economically a unique situation.
Because, on one hand, the very important measures we are taking to prevent the health and safety of Canadians, simultaneously are leading to a reduction of economic activity.
We are, as a country, asking people to stay home and we are seeing -- and would really like to praise this, forward-looking action by cities and provinces shutting down places where people gather.
That is absolutely the right thing to do. and it does inevitably have an economic impact.
The way we're thinking about this, and I'm not going to go into the details but the way we are thinking about it is very much, I would say, along the lines of things we're seing from other countries that have been -- faced this earlier than we have.
Countries like singapore, which have focused on what can you do to be sure that this period when we need to socially distance and we need to stay home, economic activity inevitably, therefore, subsides.
How can we take measures to ensure that no damage is done to sectors of the economy, that no damage is done to canadian businesses.
and that individual Canadians are able to continue to get through that and able to continue to buy groceries and pay their rent during this period.
At the same time, there is a real focus on ensuring that all the essential services that we need, even in this time of social distancing, are able to go on. So Minister hajdu today and yesterday has made the important point that we're thanking our health care professionals but we need to thank all the people that are encuring that we all have groceries in our stores, that we still have medicines in our drugstores, that we still have heat and light in our buildings.
So that also needs to be and is a part of our economic approach and I see the menster who is also very involved in our economic thinking kind of looks like he is fidgeting beside me. Do you want to add anything?







**Interpreter**:

[inaudible] to come back to what you're saying.
But yes, we are in a very unique type of economic crisis.
It's unprecedented in the industry of Canada because we have issues of both supply and demand.
Canadians have a very limited demand because of the economic insecurity that prevails.
They have to pay for food, for rent, and buy medication.
Goods and services that Canadians need to survive, that is what they need to survive for the next few weeks, but in addition there is the problem of supply.
Because the production of goods and services is slowed down, it's very complicate of the rigorous policies that we're putting in place to protect the health and safety of Canadian workers and families.
So it is a new economic situation and the measures that are going to be announced are measures that are going to take into account these issues of both supply and demand.
With regard to consumption.
Thank you.



Thank you.
Last question on the telephone.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question is from Lauren gardener from politico.



Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Thank you for taking My question.
I'm wondering what sort of financial aid might the cabinet be considering for transportation carriers in Canada.
I'm thinking specifically air Canada, transat, west jet and via rail as they see demand from it.



Mr. Garneau? [please stand by]



We have been thoughtful about and listening to what we're hearing from the indigenous and northern communities.
and as Minister hajdu said and the Prime Minister said, there will be additional specific measures announced very soon.
... just about this.
He will -- the idea behind these daily briefings is ministers who have particular announcements to make will be here.
That is why we have the minister with us today to talk about parks.
You'll be seeing Minister miller when he has specific measures toannounce.
He did today share with members of the committee what is happening in specific communities.
I also want to say as we heard from Dr. Tam, Dr. New, Minister hajdu, we're seeing across the province, whether it's cities, provinces, indigenous communities, Canadians acting and taking the right measures for those communities.
Premier ford phoned me this morning before announcing Ontario's emergency decision.
and that is what we need to do. We all need to be acting and taking the right measures in our own communities and that includes indigenous communities.
At the same time, the federal government is here to lead and provide the necessary resources and we're going to do that, too.



Global news for next question.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



Our action when it comes to the United States border is very much about understanding that the Canada-United States border is a particular relationship and a particular border for Canada.
Nearly 200, 000 people cross thatborder every day and that borderand that traffic that goes across that border is literally a lifeline for both the Canadians and the americans on both sides of that border.
We get our groceries, thanks to truckers who drivelet me encourage potential visitors not to make those tripsto Canada unless it's essential.
Now is not the time for our american friends to be coming just for a visit.
That is for the health of potential visitors and for the health of Canadians.
So British Columbia has been very clear about that and federal government is very clear about that, too.
Now as the Prime Minister said yesterday, nothing is off the table for Canada.
and we are very urgently reviewing the situation.
Also in close partnership and collaboration with our southern neighbours.
Minister blair had a conversation yesterday with his counterpart, the secretary of homeland security, so these are ongoing and urgent conversations.
Particular care needs to be taken because that border is a lifeline and we want to be cleartoday to strongly discourage allnonessential travel in both directions across that border given the situation that our continent is in. It doesn't make sense.



Maybe if I can add, as a member of parliament who is close to a border with the United States, when we say nonessential travel, that includes crossing the border to buy cigarettes and alcohol, to pick up packages delivered to the United States, to do grocery shopping in the United States because the prices may or may not be lower or you cannot find specific items in Canada.
These are nonessential trips.
When we're saying nonessential trips, there are sometimes things have taken for granted Ina border town for a very long time.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible]-- why is that coming tomorrow? that package?



Well, we did have some strong economic measures announced bot hon Wednesday of last week, the $1 billion coronavirus response package and then a further $10 billion set of measures announced on Friday.
Those are strong responses.
I think we all agree with all of the premiers and all Canadians that Canada needs to do more.
and we will.
You will be hearing very soon from Minister morneau about a strong further set of actions we will take.
As you heard from Minister Duclos, Canada is in a fortunate position in that we have the fiscal fire power to act and we will.
and I really want to assure Canadians that the federal government will do what it takes to get us through this crisis and to ensure that Canadian workers, Canadian businesses, are in a position to come roaring back when the measures imposed by social distancing can be set aside.
and we're going to be listening to our health experts as to when that time is, but that time will definitely come.
and our job as a government right now is, first of all, health and safety of Canadians absolute priority.
I think we all agree we need to do whatever it takes.
We have to put in place the measures to help us get through that period.
We have to be sure that our economy is ready to come back out of the gate strong.
We're going to do that and you're going to like what you hear from Minister morneau very soon.



Thank you.
This concludes the press conference.



All right, that is a long press conference by a series of cabinet ministers and public health officials to bring us up to date on basic message, that is to do as much as possible to try and limit the spread of coronavirus.
The Prime Minister saying again today, stay home if you don't have to leave the house, don't. He, of course, himself is self-isolating.
I'll bring you up to date on a couple of bits of news importantfor you today.
We do have a fifth death in thiscountry and it is the first one in the province of Ontario.
The province with the highest number of cases now confirming afirst detective of an elderly man, 77 years old, who had underlying conditions.
Wasn't known to be infected withcovid-19, but subsequently that was the case.
and his case was related to the fact he was in contact with someone else.
So that's one death in Ontario and four deaths in British Columbia.
All related to a long-term care centre there.
and the other message I think weheard both from Dr. Tam and others today is that what they're trying to do right now is stop the chain of transmission.
To make sure that the cases thatcould happen from one to anotherwithout travel are completely broken.
and that is why they're asking everyone to really limit social contact.
Let's bring in host of "power and politics", Vassy kapelos anddavid Cochrane for the perspective.
I'll start, Vassy, with you on the border.
You know, just because that's where we ended.
I thought the language that the deputy Prime Minister used therewas useful, because I think people are still struggling to understand, saying that the border is a lifeline.



Yeah, that's the exact term she used.
It's understandable even if you break it down to daily needs.
What is everyone need, thinking about quarantine or self-isolation for two weeks, enough food to get through the two weeks.
Most of our food, as the deputy Prime Minister pointed out, but a number of experts over the past 24 hours, during the wintermonths comes from the United States.
There is a constant back-and-forth of people who aretransporting that food across the border.
She did say also -- this is something they have said since yesterday -- there are a lot of ongoing conversations with cabinet ministers and their counterparts in the United States.
I know president trump spoke earlier about the border as well.
He has expressed a desire not toclose it down because of the integration as well, but clearlythere seems to be some kind of conversation going on about whatmight be done to address the border.
It is a concern for canadian officials and we see that particularly, for example, in Ontario, where so many of the cases, especially over the past few days, that are arising when they identify the origin, it's from the United States.
There is a greater concern and we saw that yesterday about the transmission of this through people who are coming home from March break, say, for example, the government has now said if you have any symptomings, you can't even get on the plane regardless of where you're coming from.
The border is a justified concern.
The solution, however, as those ministers and as the Prime Minister have pointed out is notreally a simple one.



No. Because you alluded to the clip from Donald trump, we'll bring you more.
He did say more about the conversations.
Let me show people that clip.



**President Donald Trump**:

Canada has not closed it to the United States, so we're working closely with the United States, but they have not closed it. They have closed it to the world, but not the United States.



Are you considering closing the United States land borders?



I don't want to say that, butwe're discussing things with Canada and Mexico, quite honestly, again the relationship is outstanding with both, outstanding.
We just signed our deal, usmca, and the deal is very strong.



Obviously, those conversations ongoing.
David, let me bring you in for your thoughts on what we heard from the ministers.
Today is really a lesson about behavior and attempt to try to stop further transmission.



Yeah, there is a real message amplification component to what is happening there today an listening to Dr. Tam and putting in the urgency of the effectiveness of social distancing.
The numbers we got yesterday, essentially, 87% of the cases were travel-related, 13% is community spread.
That is yesterday.
That is changing faster than thestock market.
The community spread is at real worrisome stuff, that's why the social distancing is front and centre on everything today.
Two quick points.
There was confusion on every canadian being able to come home, because it's true and not true at the same time.
If you're a canadian and you're abroad and you're sick and you can get to the canadian border, you're allowed in. You can drive there, train there, bike there.
We heard bill blair say you willbe assessed by public health officer.
It becomes more complex if you have to fly into Canada internationally.
That's where the sick Canadians can't come home.
If you get to the border, you can come home, but if you're sick you can't get on the plane.
That is the distinction.
The answers were confusing and conflicting throughout the news conference and we had the added challenge of not being able to hear all the questions, so the context may have been lost on people.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, they say we're going to hear from bill morneau soon, we're going to hear from bill morneau tomorrow.
I don't know if calling this a stimulus package is right.
This is an aid package.
This is trying to put as much asof a floor as you can to the international slump that is coming.
You heard Chrystia Freeland saying it's about helping businesses war back once this pandemic phase changes.
As you ask people to self-isolate and as more people listen, you reduce economic activity, you reduce income and the measures that the Prime Minister talked about, changing the child benefit, the rebates, they're going to pull all the levers they have where they can put money directly into your bank account to keep a roof overyour head, lights on and fridge full of food and the businesses to have the ability to come backwhen this is over.
a lot of companies could come back 10 years ago, they're trying to avoid that.



I want to bring in a doctor on standby.
I hope I got your name right, doctor.
Thank you for being here.
You're an infectious disease specialist.
I want to ask you what you took from -- I don't know if you've been sitting there the whole time, I appreciate if you have been -- what about this big push to get people to stay home and not interact?



This is exactly the message for a couple of weeks now.
It's so important, this idea of social distancing.
I'm so glad to see we've been doing it in the messaging and what we're actually seeing.
The state of emergency was important because it allowed the province to go down certain things that are important, closing restaurants, bars, libraries.
Any of these things that are gathering.
I think the messaging has intensified, but hasn't changed.
We've been talking about this for a week, it's important to flatten the curve.



If the message is ramping up, it's because the window to flat the curve in terms of how many cases there are and the capacity of our health system, it is shutting.
Patty hajdu was pretty clear about that.



and I completely agree.
It's important we have to do this before.
We have to learn lessons from Italy, Spain and china.
If you don't do this early enough, then it's not going to have as much as an effect.
We're trying to get the biggest bang for our buck by doing this right now.
and I'm optimistic that it will have an effect to blunt the outbreak.



One more question.
That is around the event.
Canada's recommendation from the public health agency is still saying don't go anywhere with 50people -- you can go places with50 people or more.
In the United States, the recommendation is 10. I'm just not going anywhere, I'drather be safe than sorry.
Do you think the next move or think Canada should move in the direction of limiting interactions to an even smaller group of people?



Yes.
I think the numbers -- they're not necessarily science-based.
The main idea is to avoid any nonessential contact.
I know it's difficult and sometimes it's not pragmatic.
If you go to the grocery store to get well needed supplies, just for now, staying away from nonessential meetings, groups ofany size.
Like Prime Minister trudeau said, it's not going to be like this forever but we all have a responsibility.



Thank you very much.
Let me just go back to Vassy fora moment as we wrap up the coverage here on CBC and CBC news network.
What will you be watching for tomorrow as we wait fort key package of measures to help the economy?



I'm watching for exactly whatdavid outlined, that is to what degree is this about aid and what kinds of aid are going to be offered? it sounds like they need legislative approach to helping EU apply to more people.
I'm getting a lot of messages worried about this week's payments, this week's bill, will this address the need right now, what is in it for small businesses, and how big is it going to be? if you're looking at that 1% g. D.p. Figure, it could be $20 billion.
I'm hearing it to be higher thanthat because the assessed need at this point, which could change and will change, is already so great.



Also maybe just a point about the emergency's act which was mentioned a number of times in the press conference.
That is an act that replaced the war measures act and it seems while it's on the table, it's unlikely that the government is going to pull the trigger on that now.



They were explicit it was a last resort and would need to be done in concert with the provinces.
It sounds like they just began the discussions, I think they said today.
So My guess is that is a little ways off.
They didn't say under which requirements they need to invokeit.
It sounds like the discussions are at a preliminary stage, but if it were invoked, that would be a game-changer.



Thank you for that.
Vassy will have more coverage on"power and politics" later at 5:00 eastern.
and david, you can check him on "the national". just an update, the key messagesfrom the government today.
The Prime Minister and his cabinet ministers saying that, again, today, you really need tolimit your contact with other people.
That if you can stay home, you should stay home.
If you are oversea, you should try and get home soon.
They announced a measure to borrow money, to lend Canadians money rather, $5, 000 to get backto pay for tickets if you need to get back.
There are some airlines, including westjet that are limiting traffic as of Sunday and we know that the border is being closed to people who are not canadian or United States citizens asof midnight Wednesday.
So midnight tomorrow.
We're expecting that economic package to be announced by the finance Minister tomorrow.
That is the government's next big move to try and help the economy as things continue to ramp up. This is the end of our coverage here on cbc television.
You can watch continuing coverage on cbc news network.
I'm rosemary barton.
Thank you for watching.
