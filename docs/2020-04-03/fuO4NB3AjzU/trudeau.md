**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Before we get going, I want to recognize that earlier today the province of Ontario announced a provincial state of emergency.
At the federal level, we've been coordinating with them and continue to do so. Ontario is taking the right steps to protect people and the health care system.
and today's announcement is an example of what we're seeing across the country.
National coordination and local action that makes sense for the circumstances on the ground.
and I want you to know Canada is here for you.
In Ontario, and in all parts of the country.
On that note, I want to recognize all of the people on the front lines of our health care system.
Whether you are a doctor or a nurse, a hospital administrator or maintenance staff, you are doing an incredible job.
I know that all Canadians are grateful.
I also want to thank all of the retired health care workers putting up their hand to come back and take care of Canadians.
But let's do more than just say thank you to our health care workers.
Let's also do what we can to lighten their load.
In her update on Monday, Dr. Tam was clear about what we should and shouldn't be doing.
Do wash your hands often.
Do sneeze into your elbow.
and don't gather in groups of more than 50 people.
These measures, and especially social distancing, are how we can ease the burden on our doctors and nurses so they can focus on our fellow Canadians who need it the most.
This is an especially important day on st. Patrick's day.
Lots of you probably had parties planned or were going to head out with friends.
Now is the time to find another way to celebrate, and to do that at home.
I know people would probably prefer to just carry on as normal.
I would, too.
But we all must take all action through social distancing to protect our health and the health of others.




**Interpreter**:

Our doctors and nurses need your help.
Your neighbours need your help.
The most vulnerable in your communities need your help.
As much as possible, stay home.
Go out only if you absolutely must and try to work from home.
Let the kids run around the house.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Our doctors and nurses need your help.
Your neighbours need your help.
Vulnerable people in the community need your help.
As much as possible, stay home.
Don't go out unless you absolutely have to. Work remotely if you can.
Let the kids run around a bit in the house.
Things will get better.
As the situation with COVID-19 continues to grow, our government will keep taking action, too.
For example, one of the things we're doing to flatten the curve is that, as of Wednesday, parks Canada is suspending visitor services at all national park, and historic sites.
What this means for our parks is that pretty much anything with a door will be closed.




**Interpreter**:

When it comes to travel, we have AA nouns ed new measures.
Global affairs has set up an emergency loan programme of up to $5, 000 to help people who need money quickly in order to come back home or to meet their needs while they are waiting to return.
We took this decision after announcing that we would be closing our border to people who are neither citizens or permanent residents of Canada.
This does involve a certain number of exceptions including flight crews and United States citizens.
Canadian abroad who need help on an urgent basis can always call 1-613-996-8885 to send an e-mail to sos@gc. Ca. With respect to the economy, the entire government is working together to maintain the strength of our economy.
We announced a series of measures involving $10 billion to protect jobs and support businesses and very soon, we will be making further announcements in that area.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As part of an emergency loan programme to global affairs Canada.
It will help people who need immediate financial assistance return home or cover their needs if they have to wait to get back.
Canadians abroad in need of emergency assistance can always call 1-613-996-8885 or e-mail sos@international.
GCC.
Ca. This comes as we announce that we're closing our air borders to people who aren't Canadian citizens or permanent residents with some exceptions like for aircrew and United States citizens.
Earlier today, the special cabinet committee on COVID-19 met once again to discuss our response.
and full cabinet will have a meeting this afternoon.
We are hard at work to create the right support package for Canadians while protecting people's jobs and our economy.
and tomorrow, we'll be making another major announcement on economic actions to support Canadians as quickly as possible.
By tend of the week, we will have more to say about changes for the upcoming tax season.
We are looking at giving more flexibility for people to make payments and for businesses to have more liquidity during this time.
Throughout this, we're working together right across the country.
I have directed the house leader tone gauge with I counterparts to discuss a brief return at the house of commons so we can bring in emergency economic measures.
There are economic pieces that will need quick passage through the house in order to support Canadians.
We are also examining the emergency measures act to see if it is necessary or if there are other ways that will enable us to take the actions needed to protect people.
Coordination at all levels and between all parties vital.
I have asked the chair and vice chair of the cabinet COVID-19 committee to ensure that there are regularized briefings for premiers, leaders of the opposition and other stakeholders for the foreseeable future.
and yesterday our regular calls with all parliamentarians began, which the public health agency of Canada is moderating.
Right now, we must all work together.
The bottom line is this -- each one of us can make choices that help the people around us. In fact, we can make choices that will save lives.
If we act now, even if it seems like a big ask, things will be better tomorrow.
Thanks to our outstanding public health professionals, we have the information we need to make informed choices.
So if you can, send an e-mail or pick up the phone instead of meeting in person.
Order takeout instead of going out to dinner.
and try to support your neighbours and friends if they're worried or need help.
Canada, let's work together.
I know we can do this.
Merci.beaucoup.



**Reporter**:

You mentioned just now you're thinking of recalling parliament for emergency measures.
Before parliament rose, they gave you a financial act that allows you to spend whatever you need to spend on this.
What sort of measures might you need to take that you don't already have?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Those are two separate things.
We are talking about recalling parliament briefly to pass legislative measures to allow us to do things around e. I. and a number of methods to get money into the pockets of Canadians.
We are also separately looking at the emergency measures act to see if there are tools that they offer us that allow us to do more things that are needed for Canadians that can't be done other ways.




**Interpreter**:

We are looking at the possibility of recalling parliament in order to pass legislative measures that would allow us to deliver aid directly to citizens.
We have the ability to invest right away to help Canadians, but there are legislative measures that need to be agreed to by parliament in order to move forward and that is why we are doing that.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Now the number of cases in the United States is constantly increasing and there is a significant site in Washington and elsewhere.
When do you expect to close the border with the United States? as I said, we are currently co-ordinating our efforts with the United States government and officials and doing everything we can to protect Canadians.
Nothing has been ruled outment we're looking at all the options.
We will do everything we can to keep Canadians safe.
and at the same time, we are ensuring that we're not harming Canadians by preventing essential goods from getting through.



**Reporter**:

Everywhere in the country -- Calgary, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal -- why not a federal directive on something like closing bars and restaurants or other nonessential businesses?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have taken significant measures up until this point.
Every step of the way.
We will continue to take necessary measures.
We know a number of provinces are moving forward in measures that are appropriate for them.
We will continue to look at what we can do at the federal level to keep Canadians safe.
Everything that needs to be done to keep Canadians safe is being done.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Radio-Canada.
Now how long will this last? people are now saying we're ready to make an effort, but how long is this going to snake are we talk about weeks, months? can you be clear with them? you're asking them to make significant efforts.
How long? well, we're asking for significant efforts of our citizens and we will be there to support our citizens.
To support small businesses and large businesses, to support people who require money to feed their family or pay their rent.
We don't know how long this will take.
It could be weeks.
It could be months.
But we will be there, standing together to support Canadians in order to get through this extremely difficult time.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We will be there as a country, for our citizens.
For our businesses, for Canadians who are worried.
Whether it's making sure that small businesses can remain viable through this difficult time, whether it's so that families can take care of their loved ones and put food on the table.
We will make sure that Canadians are able to hold through this difficult time.
We don't know exactly how long this is going to take.
Whether it takes weeks or months.
But we know that every step of the way, we will be there to support each other.
That is what Canadians do.



**Reporter**:

Canada's responsible for the poor living conditions in indigenous communities, which makes them more vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. Why isn't more being done to prepare these communities for this pandemic?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the very beginning, we have been working closely with indigenous services, with indigenous leadership across the country to ensure that what is needed to be done will be done for indigenous and remote communities.
We know that there is a higher degree of vulnerability.
There are already vulnerabilities because of difficult conditions in so many of those communities.
That is why we are taking extra measures to ensure that indigenous people across this country remain safe.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, up until yesterday, it's already almost two months since the coronavirus initially occurred in china and Wuhan city and Huber province become the epicenter.
So, for two months, even though 62 countries have taken measures to restrict travel from china, Canada doesn't believe in closing the border and didn't take any measures to stop travelers from the epicenter.
and then yesterday, the announcement to close the border not only to people from the epicenter, but also to almost everybody except United States citizens.
So, it looks like, you know, the policies are from one extreme to another.
Like what happened? what makes the government to move the policy from one extreme to another extreme?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think people have noticed that the situation has evolved incredibly rapidly around the world and that does require different decision-making at different moments.
We took responsible decisions to keep Canadians safe, including measures at the airport, as issues started to happen in wuhan and in china and that was able to keep Canadians safe as we saw a very low incidents of spread of the virus in Canada, even though we didn't do what other countries did and closed the border because we followed the recommendations of our public health officials and we were able to control the spread of the virus from the very beginning.
The situation has now changed and the recommendations of our scientists and experts have changed.
and we are continuing to do and will continue to do everything that is needed, every step of the way to protect Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Yesterday president trump told Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.
Today you're still saying 50 people.
Why don't you believe that same advice is necessary to give Canadians now and at what point would you be at the point where you would give Canadians that same restriction of limiting gathers to 10 people.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The advice given yesterday by our chief medical officer of Canada, Dr. Teresa tam, was to avoid gatherings of 50 people.
Of course, Canadians should look to as much social distancing as possible.
They should look to stay home.
They should look to take measures that keep themselves and their families and their neighbourhoods safe while not overburdening our public health system.
These are the things that Canadians must do and we'll continue to keep people informed on the best ways to keep Canadians safe.




**Interpreter**:

Dr. Teresa tam, the chief medical officer, announced yesterday there should not be groups getting together in more than 50 and that is exactly what I repeated today.
Of course, all Canadians should try to isolate themselves as much as possible, stay home with their em fast, not go into the public and take whatever measures are necessary to keep supporting each other.



**Reporter**:

You told our colleagues at radio-Canada earlier that there are Canadians that just won't get home.
Can you give us a sense of how many Canadians will be stranded and what kind of options are available to these Canadians like repatriation flights, for example, and how do you justify at leaving them there?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are looking at every possible way of bringing Canadians home.
There are three million Canadians at any given moment around the world living and working and I think it is just realistic to know that some of them will not be coming home in the coming weeks.
But we will make measures available to global affairs Canada to make sure as many Canadians as possible, as many Canadians as want to can come home.
This is something that all Canadians are respecting of their government and we will be doing it.



**Interpreter**:

I think people know that there are almost three million Canadians who are traveling or living abroad at any pointer in time.
and it is certainly the case that some of them will not be able to return to Canada in the coming days.
But there are certainly a lot of Canadians around the world who will want to come back home and that is why global affairs Canada is now making money available and assistance available to them, looking at flights.
We're looking at everything we can do to facilitate their return for as many Canadians as possible and as soon as possible.



**Reporter**:

Why isn't the federal government -- sorry, invoking a state of emergency and where is the government going to find all the money to pay for all the measures that you have to rule out over the next little while?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

State of emergency isn't necessarily something in itself.
It's a way of enact acing measures that otherwise would not be able to be enacted.
So, we're looking at the emergency act to look at what those measures are, that it would make available and whether there are other ways, without having to bring in a state of emergency, that we could invoke them.
We are examining that very carefully.
and on the cost of the measures, Canada has taken responsible fiscal decisions over the past years that have allowed us to have a significant troop maneuver on investing in our economy.
We are the g-7 country with the lowest debt-to-g. D.p. Ratio, the lowest deficit as -- debt as a proportion of the size of our economy and that allows us to invest significantly in Canadians, in businesses, to make sure who are able to make it did through this difficult time and make sure we're able to prosper and grow once we're through this moment.
That is the result of the decisions we have taken responsibly as a government over the past years.



We'll now go to a few questions on the phone.
Just one question, no follow-up.



**Vassy**:

a couple of things, and one -- some factual information that he provided.
But actually I thought one sentence that he delivered will have a big impact on Canadians and that is the response he gave to the question when he was asked how long he thinks these measures will have to be in place.
How long he thinks Canadians will have to act in this manner.
and he said he didn't know but that it could be weeks or months and I think we all know that.
On some level, that is what we're hearing from professionals, health professionals.
I think to hear the Prime Minister say that, we'll have an impact on Canadians and it speaks to the seriousness of what's going on right now.
As far as what came out of what he said, a few things that we are expecting an announcement regarding the economy tomorrow.
That twas the end of the week, they will have something on taxes.
We were speaking before about the upcoming deadline and whether or not that will be delayed.
a lot of business owners thinking about that as well as individual Canadians and he talked about the possibility of the house coming back and that the house leader, Pablo Rodriguez, was in conversations with his counterparts to figure out how to do that.
It looks like that would happen in order to pass legislation that would allow them to amend e. I. or I am interpreting it to allow them to offer direct payments to Canadians.
He didn't use those exact words but to get money directly to people who need it. As we are speaking, I believe the -- bill morneau's counterpart in the United States is announcing something very similar.
That they are about to do something like that.
Announce payments to Americans as well.
That is something to watch and finally they are considering the emergencies act.
I'm told to look at the one section of the act that involves public welfare and that is certainly around shutting down things more broadly and taking a federal approach to all the instructions that we're getting at the moment.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. That comes on a day that Ontario has declared a provincial state of emergency, although not used all the powers at the premier's disposal right now.
Just shutting down certain places, he could go much broadly and the federal emergency act is not clear whether it's necessary because it essentially allows the government to go in and do things that provinces may not be doing.
They are looking at whether those things are needed.
He also talked about Canadians that are stuck overseas after saying earlier this morning that he, on a radio interview, that there are Canadians who aren't going to get home.
That is just not going to happen.
But there are some measures in place.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
There will be financial support for people.
But as you said, there are as many as three million Canadians who will be abroad internationally at any given point in time and given the rapid escalation of what has happened here, a lot of people may be stuck -- not because the government won't let them come home -- but because there is no capacity or flight surge.
But there is no way to move them.
The borders are getting thick and the small world is getting quite large in distance as we do this.
Unpacking thematically in this, listen do your doctor.
But Canada's a country of rights but one of responsibilities and essentially saying that now is the time for responsibilities.
For people to be responsible in their own personal behaviour.
Everyone should work from home as much as they confirm but one of the traps, as people follow the medical advice of social distancing and not going out, the economic damage caused by COVID-19 simply expands so we now know that the stimulus or aid package will come tomorrow.
I think the legislative changes they need to make to employment insurance is to allow people who don't qualify for e. I., who are self-employed or small business owners to qualify for e. I. as a way of making sure that they put money into their pockets and put a financial floor under people in this enormously difficult time so they can keep the lights on and the fridge full.
The way they would do legislation, this is the thing that pablo rodriguez told us when they suspended the house of commons until at least April 20. They have a deal to bring everybody back.
Not 338 members of parliament, but a much smaller group, maybe random numbers of, say, 40 proportional to the standings.
They can all spread out in the house of commons and they can all work together to give the government the legislative authority they need.
So, we know bill morneau will roll out the more specific details of this tomorrow and a sense of the order of magnitude, rosey, economists have been telling the government any stimulus package needs to be the equivalent of 1% of g. D.p. So that is in the $20 to $30 billion range.
I'm told more or less that is where it's going to land, in addition to the $10 billion in credit that was extended to small and medium-sized businesses on Friday.



**Rosemary**:

and Steve mnuchin is giving a press conference right now.
We'll try to bring you some of that later in which he says he will drop the payroll tax cut and he is going to find ways to directly get money to Americans and he was asked whether the markets should remain open as they continue to stumble along sort of blindly and his answer was yes.
Let me also just bring people up to date on news of another death in this country related to COVID-19. This is now the fifth death in Canada.
Though for the first time here in the province of Ontario.
It is a man who died at the royal Victoria hospital in Barrie.
a man in his 70s with underlying conditions who had contact with another person who tested positive for COVID-19. It is My understanding that the death, he only tested positive for COVID-19 after.
But that would be the first death in Ontario.
Remember, four other deaths in British Columbia.
All related to one long-term care centre where there has been an outbreak.
and this, again, reiterates that whole message that there are particular pieces of population that are more vulnerable, obviously.
More susceptible to getting the virus, more susceptible to dying.
But what you heard from the Prime Minister today and we're standing by to take you to some cabinet ministers speaking shortly as well, it's not really about whether you are susceptible, but whether you will spread it and also allowing capacity at hospitals, which is really the critical part of this right now as well.
I'll tell you that the Prime Minister did announce $5, 000 loan for Canadians stuck abroad who need money to get by or who need money to get out.
and you can e-mail sos@international.
Gc. Cg for that.
Here's Chrystia Freeland.



and then you'll have a chance to ask your questions.




**Interpreter**:

Thank you all for being here today.



Let me start by saying how sad I was to hear that there are now four Canadians -- four more Canadians who have died of COVID-19. and to their families and friends, all of us extend our sincerest condolences.
Today we have just held a two-hour meeting of the coronavirus cabinet committee.
In particular, we discussed our border with United States and the emergency act.
As nay I can't understand know, the emergency act is a measure of last resort which grants the federal government extraordinary powers.
I could never be invoked without consultation with the provinces.
We are in a difficult situation.
As the W.H.O. Said this morning, during its daily update, this is the defining global health crisis of our time.




**Interpreter**:

We know that the situation will get worse before it gets better.
We are adjusting as things move forward because the situation is evolving every hour and every day.
Yesterday the Prime Minister announced new measures that are more robust to further stop the spread of the virus and to help Canadians and protect their safety.
We know that these are extraordinary measures.
But the extraordinary circumstances, we see now, demand them.



To flatten the curve of the pandemic in Canada is closing.
That is why I'd like to emphasize today how important it is that each one of us takes personal responsibility.
Each of us needs to protect ourselves and each other.




**Interpreter**:

Yesterday, Dr. Tam encouraged all Canadians to avoid public gatherings of more than 50 people.
It is extremely important that we abide by all of these recommendations.
We can work online and we are encouraging you to stay home.



Yesterday she urged all of us to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people.
It is very important for all of us to listen carefully to her.
I can assure you our government does.
Postpone, cancel or move your events online.
and please stay home.
For employers and managers, please find ways for your staff to work from home, if at all possible.
Millions of Canadians are already stepping up and changing their behaviour in order to keep themselves, their families and their neighbours safe.
The way we will flatten the curve is by practicing social distancing and listening to the excellent advice from Canada's health experts.
If you can help a neighbour in need, please do so while maintaining social distance.
We all need to work hard to protect the most vulnerable Canadians.




**Interpreter**:

We must all practice social distancing and stay home as much as possible.
a team Canada means that we are taking care of each other.
We rely on each other.



I'd like to conclude by offering My deepest thanks to everyone on the frontlines.
Health care workers, nurses, doctors, public health officials, researchers, border service officers, airport staff and the many others who are working so hard around-the-clock for all of us. Thank you.
Merci.
Now we'll hear from our Minister of health and doctors tam and gnu and then from our Minister of heritage and then our Minister of public safety and emergency preparedness and then from our Minister of transport and, last but very much not least, from our  so, Minister of health, Minister hajdu.



Thank you very much, deputy Prime Minister.



**Interpreter**:

[inaudible].



Condolences to the families who have contracted COVID-19 and families who have someone that's ill and what that means for their loved one and their family.
As we can see from the numbers and Dr. Tam will talk about that in a moment, we've seen a substantial increase in the number of cases in Canada over the past several days and when we say the window is closing, this is exactly what we mean.
As we see numbers dramatically increase each day, what we're trying now together as a society to do so flatten the curve of infection and we also see those numbers indicate that we see an increased level of community transmission.
The flatten the curve message today is really the most important one.
The measures that we take today will help us ensure that we can actually reduce the level of community transmissions that are happening across the country.
So it is important that people are taking immediate action.
You know the changes that we announced yesterday around the border, and I won't repeat those.
But many Canadians traveling abroad are very concerned and this is why we're setting up a programme to support those Canadians and help them to return home.
The changes that are happening right now are disruptive and they are fast.
This is a stressful time for everyone.
We do have this opportunity right now to do what needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of all of our citizens and protect our health care system to be able to resfonld -- respond to the most critical of cases.
It is up to all of us to limit the spread of COVID-19. Stay home, especially when you're sick, and avoid large gatherings, even if you're healthy.
Anything from 50 now is too big.
It is st. Patrick's day today, but we have to practice social distancing, even on days that we normally would be celebrating with one another.
Don't shake hands.
Keep a two-metre distance from each other.
Acting together now will also protect all of our frontline workers, the health care providers and board of service agents, our police officers across our country, public health officials working so hard to protect us and I want to thank all of our workers for extraordinary efforts under such difficult circumstances.
But I also want to thank all the other workers who are keeping the grocery stores stocked and the lights on. Thank you so much.
We see ywe appreciate you.
and we're so grateful as Canadians that you continue to serve your fellow citizens.
I'm very impressed to see Canadians coming together this way in a crisis, but I'm not surprised.
We see what needs to be done together and we are doing it. This pan democrat sick no exception.
We will get through this hard time together.
So My last appeal is make sure that you're kind to one another.
Check in with vulnerable people by phone.
Think of ways you can help to ensure that we get through this together.
[voice breaking]there are scared people.
There are lonely people.
There are frightened people.
and it doesn't take a lot to reach out to them and say that you're there with them even in spirit, to ask what they might need.
We can do things for one another.
We can deliver groceries to someone who has no ability to get out.
We can ensure that there are ways that we can support our colleagues and our citizens.
So just make sure you continue to ask how you can help.
The same messages that we learned as children apply now.
Share.
Be kind.
Ask how you can help.
Together as Canadians we will get through this.



Ok. Well, thank you very much, Minister hajdu.
We'll now hear from Dr. Tam, please.



Thank you.
and good afternoon, everyone.
Globally, there are now over 180, 000 cases of COVID-19 in over 160 countries.
As of right now, we have over 440 cases in Canada.
Most of the cases continue to be among travelers or their close contacts.
and we still have eight confirmed cases among Canadians repatriated from the grand princess cruise ship.
and there are quarantines in c. F.b. Trenton.
What's concerning is what we're seeing in Ontario, including three cases reported yesterday that have no link to travel outside of Canada.
These cases are currently being investigated as community transmission.
The cluster of cases in the long-term care facility in British Columbia and now the one death reported this Ontario, reminds us of the serious nature of this virus and its impact on high-risk groups.
We also have a number of cases in several provinces that are connected to a large dental conference in vancouver with about 15, 000 participants.
This, again, is a reminder of what these large gatherings can do to amplify COVID-19 and why it is so important to practice social distancing to delay the spread.
If Canada is to succeed at delaying the outbreak and flattening the epidemic curve, we will all need to bring our best game and team Canada spirit to bear, to protect our country and, most importantly, to protect our vulnerable populations.
Public health authorities are continuing with a strong effort to detect cases, to meticulously trace and manage contacts.
Our provincial and national laboratories have tested over 137, 000 individuals to date.
This allows us to identify cases quickly and interrupt any chains of transmission and slow the spread of COVID-19. For every one of us, we need to know that each of our actions to increase the physical space between us, by cushing social gatherings, avoiding entertainment in crowded and closed spaces, postponing travel and living with everyday increases, we can delay and dampen the impact of COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable.
But if the measure of a society is in how it cares for its most vulnerable, I'm call on all Canada to pull together and flatten this curve.
I'd like to remind Canadians that there is an ongoing need to continue donating blood.
We need blood donors to book and keep their appointments to prevent shortages.
Canadian blood services has robust cleaning, infection control and screening practices in places to protect all donors, staff and volunteers.
Since this is st. Patrick's day, I would like to quote a wise irish colleague and a leader in the COVID-19 international response.
Mike ryan, director of the world health organization emergencies programme has said "be fast, have no regrets.
The virus will always get you if you are not prepared.
If you need to be right before you move, you would never win.
Speed trumps perfection.
The greatest error is not to move." so let's show them how we can move Canada and this is our chance right here, right now.
Thank you.



Ok. Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Dr. Nu?







**Interpreter**:

Thank you and good afternoon, everyone.
At the global scale, there are more than 180, 000 cases of COVID-19 and 160 countries.
Right now there are more than 440 cases of COVID-19 in Canada.
Most of those cases continue to be identified among travelers.
There are also eight confirmed cases of Canadians who are repatriated from a cruise ship, the grand princess, and who are now quarantined at c. F.b. Trenton.
The increase in the number of cases in Ontario is particularly concerning with three cases identified yesterday that have no link to travel outside Canada.
Those cases are currently being investigated for community transmission.
Other cases in a long-term care facility in British Columbia where some people have died, reminds us of the seriousness of this situation and its impact on people at high risk.
There is now one death in Ontario as well.
We can also see a number of cases in various provinces that are connected to a large conference of dental surgeons in vancouver.
Where 15, 000 people were in attendance.
That shows us once again the effect of large gatherings on the increase in cases of COVID-19 and the importance of social distancing in order to delay the spread.
If Canada wants to succeed in delaying the spread of the virus and flattening the epidemic curve, we must give the best of ourselves and pull together in order to protect our country and particularly our vulnerable Canadians.
There are sustained efforts to detect the cases of COVID-19 and are doing robust contact tracing.
The public health laboratories in the provinces and in winnipeg are conducting tests on more than 37, 000 Canadians.
We will be in a position to detect those cases and determine the transmission trajectory.
For the welfare of all, we need to ensure that through each of our actions we are keeping a proper distance between ourselves and others by avoiding social gatherings and close, well-attend and entertainment complexes.
We can delay the spread of this disease.
and mitigate the impacks and protect the most vulnerable Canadians.
If a society is judged by its ability to take care of the most vulnerable, we're asking all Canadians to come together and flatten the curve.
Before concluding, we just want to remind all Canadians that we still need blood donations.
In other words to prevent any shortages, we need blood donors to continue to keep their appointments and provide blood.
The canadian blood services has put in proper hygiene practices to fight infection and can protect any donors as well as employees and volunteers.
To celebrate st. Patrick's day, I'd like to quote a well-known irishman, Dr. Mike ryan from the world health organization.
He is the chief physician.
What he said is be fast and have no regrets.
The virus will catch us if we're not ready.
Speed will always trump perfection.
That is the most important thing.
The biggest mistake is to not take action.
Let's show them what Canada can do. Let's take this opportunity now.
Thank you.











**Interpreter**:

You're from the Minister of Canadian heritage, Stephen guilbeault.
Good morning, everyone.
My sincerest condolences to the friends and family for Canadian victims to date and to say that I am with all of those who are touched -- who are affected by the spread of this virus.
We are fully aware of the decisions of the public health authorities on independent workers, community organisations and the arts, culture and sports sector.
We have said that we would continue to take proactive decisions, as the situation involves, and that is what we're doing.
That also means prevention on a large scale.
That is why, as of tomorrow, that is March 18 and until April 30, all parks Canada facilities will be closed and parks Canada will no longer admit any visitors.
It will suspend all of its visitors linked to its national parks, historic sites and marine conservation areas.
Only essential services regarding search and rescue as well as maintenance will be maintained.



and up to April 30. The physical installations of parks Canada will no longer be open.
Parks Canada will no longer admit visitors and we'll suspend all services related to the national park, historic sites, and national marine conservation areas.
Only essential research, rescue, security services and maintenance will be maintained.




**Interpreter**:

The Prime Minister said yesterday and I repeat, the number one priority is to protect the health and safety of Canadians.
No decision is taken lightly and that is why if you are in doubt, follow the directives of your local health agency as well as the Canada public health agency.
I might remind you that the closing of parks Canada is under the responsibility of environment Canada and is part of joint efforts with province and municipalities to protect health and safety of our communities by focus on social distancing measures.
Please stay home.
That is the best way to protect yourself and to protect your family and the most vulnerable populations.
These are joint and individual efforts and these are what is needed to slow the spread of coronavirus.
We have to temporarily suspend activities to preserve our values and referring to mutual aid and solidarity.
I would like to thank all Canadians for your rigor and patience and thanks to those who are being creative by putting their tools free of charge or at a very low price at the service of Canada.
You are reaching out to Canadians and that is very important.
All culture -- our culture continues to live online and thank you for everyone who provides information to enlighten us with regard to current events.
Other announcements will follow in coming days.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] thank Canadians for your determination and patience.
Thank you as well for those who continue to freely offer their creative material for their public and continuing your very important educational work.
Our culture lives on, online, through your platforms.
Thank you for ensuring that people have access to quality information, which keeps us up to date on current events.
More information will follow in the coming days.

**Interpreter**:

Thank you, Minister guilbeault.



Now bill Blair.
Please.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
As a result of the measures that we announced yesterday and on the advice of public health, the Canada border services have increased their operational posture and I'd like to quickly review the measures that are now in place.
All international travelers are being asked do you currently have a cough, difficulty breathing or do you feel you have a fever? they are also confirmed to ask the following statement.
I've acknowledged that I've been asked to self-isolate for the next 14 days to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19. There is now an enhance border officer presence at all major ports of entry, to carry a public health screening and out reach and officers are on the lookout for any traveler who looks sick or who reports that they are feeling symptoms and they will refer all suspected cases to public health authorities.
These measures have not only come into effect for air travelers, but have also been implemented for land, rail and ferry travelers.
Instructional handouts are being provided to all a travelers arriving in Canada.
The hand-out advises them to self-isolate at home for 14 days, to monitor themselves for symptoms and to contact public health authorities should they develop symptoms.
In addition, masks are distributed to high-risk travelers as required and there is an increased signage at owl of our points of entry as well as enhanced cleaning and disinfection of high traffic areas and facilities at our airports.
I also would like to take the opportunity to clarify for Canadians, we know that there are very many Canadians, for example, who are presently in the United States and are quickly making their way home.
I want to ensure them all.
Canadians will always be allowed to return to Canada.
and if the canadian who returns is exhibiting symptoms when they present themselves at a land border or port of entry, they will immediately be refered to public health agency of Canada quarantine officer for examination.
But they will, of course, be allowed into the country and following that assessment, the travel will either be given a mask and instructed to self-isolate at home or in more severe cases, subject to examination by a quarantine officer.
Higher volume land border crosss willing have a public health representative on site, while smaller ports of entry will go through examination of symptoms over the phone with public health.
We are constantly evaluating the situation and we will take whatever measures that may be proved necessary.
We'll continue to work closely with health authorities, border officials, our provincial and a territorial partners and we're in very close contact, working with our international partners to ensure that we do what is best for Canadians.
I'd also like to speak, because we have a number of inquiries of individuals that cross our borders regularly seeking refugee status.
The measures that are currently in place is those individuals are immediately taken into custody by the RCMP.
They are screened thoroughly by our customs border officers.
This process takes about 24 hours and they are also now being screened for any evidence of symptom and questioned about where they have been.
Under normal circumstances, when this process is concluded and as they go into our process.
Es of determining the eligibility for refugee status, they are temporarily housed in montreal.
But because of the need for the 14-day self-isolation, we're making separate arrangements for those individuals to be placed in appropriate health in order to accommodate the requirement for the period of isolation.
We are doing this because we believe it is necessary and in the best interest of keeping all Canadians healthy and safe.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Minister Blair.



**Interpreter**:

and now we go to the Minister of transport.



Merci.
Thank you.




**Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I'd like to also add My condolences to those who lost a family or friend COVID-19. Yesterday our government announced extraordinary measures to protect Canadians' health and safety with regard to COVID-19. As of midnight tonight, all incoming flights from Europe, Asia and south America will be redirected to Montreal, Toronto, Calgary or Vancouver.
As of tomorrow morning, as of tomorrow noon, rather, Canada will reduce the embankment of foreign nationals on flights to Canada from all countries exempt the United States.
Canada will also refuse act a says es to foreign nationals from the United States if they have reside outside of Canada or in the United States over the past 14 days.



Any passenger exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of nationality, will not be allowed to board a flight to Canada.
Also, every traveler need to remain in self-isolation for 14 days if they come to Canada, whether it is by plane or through land border and regardless of their nationality.
These measures are robust and unpress denlded.
-- unprecedented.
We are assessing the situation on an hourly basis and taking action as appropriate to protect Canadians.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Mr. Garneau.
and now the president of the treasury board.



**Interpreter**:

Thank you, ms. Freeland.
As My colleagues have said, the situation is changing rapidly and, in this context, we held a meeting of the cabinet committee on COVID-19 and we will have a full cabinet meeting because all of the ministers play an important part of managing this crisis, which is undress den ed in the history of our country.
This morning, Prime Minister Trudeau announced a number of measures that I will summarize very quickly.
The house of commons summoned by Mr. Pablo Rodriguez, the leader of the house, to give legislative approval very quickly.
Two measures of economic st um us will and support, especially to Canadians who are going through difficult conditions right now and so parliament will be reconvened rapidly.
We're considering the use of the emergency measures act.
All members of the cabinet are being consulted in order to hear from -- to get the opinions of the provinces and territories and also this morning we have received important notices from the public health agency, gatherings of 50 people or more are discouraged.
The public health agency also reminds Canadians to not travel abroad, unless it is for essential reasons.
That all visitors, such as Minister Blair said, regardless of where they come from and regardless of where they go through must self-isolate for a minimum of 14 days and we would encourage and should not leave their homes unless necessary.
I might also remind that the Prime Minister announced merge loans of up to $5, 000 for people going through difficult times, a people who wish to come back to Canada but are having trouble doing so. So Prime Minister trudeau announced the availability of these emergency loans and finally in cooperation with other cabinet ministers.
Ms. Freeland and myself will be forming, creating a formal mechanism to work with the provinces and territoris in this emergency context.
We're also going to be -- work to put in place a mechanism to ensure that all members of parliament, as well as the opposition members can quickly have access to the correct information so they can do the work that is required with their constituents and there is going to be a council that will regularly meet and represent social organisations and workers and to deal with this crisis.
But the Prime Minister's main message is that people should take care of themselves and of others because there are a great number of people, as Minister hajdu said, there are many people who feel alone and vulnerable and anxious and in this difficult context that we're going through, we have to remember to take care of others and take care of ourselves.
Thank you.
We are now ready to take questions.
Thank you.
We're going to question period now.



Minister Blair will be available for questions after cabinet.
So we'll go with three questions in the room and then over the phone.




**Interpreter**:

Three questions in the room and then three questions over the phone.
and then we'll all er -- alternate that way.
Inaudible for the interpreter.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



**Interpreter**:

You are organizing things with the airline company concretely.
What do you intend to put in place?







**Interpreter**:

Yes, definitely.
and that is something that Minister champagne is doing as well.
We're speaking with our Canadian airlines in order to be able to repatriate Canadians who are stuck abroad and currently in discussions with them so as to choose certain places in the country where it will be possible to send flights so that we can repatriate those people.
Sort of a bridge to these destinations.
We're in the preliminary phase right now of these discussions but I'm certainly hopeful that is the direction we're heading in.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



**Interpreter**:

You talked about emergency measures and I would like to know what this act will allow you to do to reconvene parliament because in the motion on Friday, it -- the interpreter cannot hear the question.







**Interpreter**:

So, regarding recalling the house.
Minister morneau will soon have more specific information regarding the measures to put in place and some of those measures will require the parliament to be reconvened.
Now also we need to work with all the provinces, including Quebec to ensure that the federal government has all the tools it needs to support them.
and in this kind of emergency context and crisis.
We must ensure that the federal government has all the tools required to help because --[micro phone feedback]







**Interpreter**:

So that we a have all the tools that we need for the Canadian government to do our job over the next little while and one of the considerations that -- and that Prime Minister Trudeau refer ed to is the use of the emergency measures act.
Thank you.
[no audio]



I think there is testing for those [inaudible] but also those who have symptoms are, for example, are hospitalized with pneumonia, for instance.
That is really key.
If you test people who don't have a travel history, that is how you're going to detect community spread.
So, this is happening.
We're hearing from jurisdictions now whether it is in British Columbia or Ontario that they're looking at certain cases that look like they have been acquired in the community.
So, this is a signal for us that we must do everything that we can nab to stop the change of transmission.
You can't eliminate the possibility of community spread in certain areas and that is why you're seeing these much increased in public health action to essentially ask everyone to social distance.
This is the really key way that you can interrupt the chain of transmission.
We are collaborating with provinces and territories on a daily basis and right now we are working together to effect any kind of need to purchase and to get those kits.
So, as far as I know, while we are planning certainly to have to focus those test kits on the people who are most likely to have the virus, we are not seeing any major issues from the perspective of being able to detect cases and to be able to detect if we do have community transmission in Canada.
But I would say that you need to, as everybody has said, look where the puck is going and not necessarily where we're at now and just do everything you can to interrupt potential change of transmission, even if you are not seeing it. So that is the approach we're taking right now.
This is very diffusely spread between provinces and territories.
It is up to them and within their own laboratories to [inaudible] the test.
We have tested over 37, 000 people already and we know that the daily capacity of provinces in general is much bigger than that.
So we have not exceeded the capacity and we're continuing to work together to look at supplies.



I'm just add.
-- I'll just add.
We have a number of processes happening under health Canada to accelerate approval of alternative testing processes.
We'll have more to say about that once we have details.



**Interpreter**:

Question inaud tonight the interpreter.
Inaudible for the interpreter.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

What Minister Blair said is once these people have been taking into custody by the RCMP and cbsa, they will be required to be in quarantine or self-isolation for a period of 14 days.
Right now they -- it is not planed that they will be in this situation in montreal, but rather in places that I will have to come back to on this.
They all have to specify where these places are, but we will need to supervise them in these places.
They will need to be supervised for 14 days and be provided with certain services.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



Thank you.
That's a great question.
I think I'll repeat what Dr. Tam and franÇois-philippe champagne have most recently said.
Now is the time to come home.
I believe the Prime Minister has also said that and it is ir respective of your circumstance.
Whether you are a snowbird or semipermanent residence in florida or arizona or not, it is time to come home.
As we can see and as we've seen since earlier days, this is a very fluid situation and things change rapidly.
Also, on top of that, if people do become ill, it is much better to become ill in your own home country where you know that you have appropriate health coverage in a way that you can be certain.
As a canadian.
and finally, I'll just say that as situations change, worldwide, with border and travels and quarantines and various local state level and federal level measures, we can't predict where other countris will go as they try to skate to where the puck is going and it is of utmost importance that snowbirds and their families -- families of snowbirds encourage those folks to come home now.



and I do want to be clear -- Canadians will always be able to come home.
People need to be clear about that.
That is the right wheel house.



We'll no -- now go over the phone.
