**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada giving his daily briefing to Canadians today, largely focused on procuring and creating the medical equipment that will be needed, that is already needed by front line health workers across the country right now.
Before I get to My colleagues, let me give you an update on another story we were tracking at the end of last week.
You might remember there were a lot of questions about the possibility that American troops would be deployed near the Canadian border, not at the Canadian border, but near the Canada-United States border in an attemptto make sure there was nobody crossing with signs of COVID-19. In fact, we can confirm now thatit is no longer under consideration, that the department of homeland security has formally dropped that aspectof their request for assistance.
That is information just coming into cbc now.
That's not going to happen and we certainly know that the canadian government officials made their case strongly to american officials that that wasnot needed and would be viewed as damaging to their relationship.
So, in fact, the department of homeland security moving away from that change entirely.
Let me bring in the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and david Cochrane.
I wanted to close the circle on that story that seems to be petering out to say the least.
and I'm not sure how exactly they came to this decision, whether it was canadian influence or pressure, or whether they just decided it didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Vassy, over to you I guess on the Prime Minister's announcement around canadian companies stepping up to create some of this equipment and how the government moves forward with that.



**Vassy**:

a couple of things, Rosie, that jumped out at me. The first positive news, if there is any, is when we heard Minister Bains and the Prime Minister I think over a week ago initially say we're going to retool everything, focus on COVID-19, let us know if you canhelp, apparently 3, 000 companies reached out to the government in that period of time to offer their help.
The Prime Minister announced the formalizing of eight contracts that the government is working with eight companies on moving forward with this type of equipment, trying to manufacturing this kind of equipment, masks, ventilators, personal protective equipment, testing kitts, all of that.
They put a dollar figure to it. They're going to spend $2 billion on it. The Prime Minister got a lot of questions, and rightly so, about the international market for all of this, meaning there are so many countries right now trying to acquire the same equipment and our colleague pointed to the United states that is aggressively trying to acquire that equipment.
What does that mean for Canada'sability to do so. The Prime Minister pointed to the significance of a domestic ramp-up in that kind of manufacturing and production andsaid we expect to have this equipment in the coming days.
He also insisted that the current level of need is being met.
Even though we keep hearing fromvarious people in healthcare that they're worried about that not being the case in the future, he said it would be met in the foreseeable future.
But I think there is cause for scrutiny in that line that we'regetting, it's in the coming days.
I realize this is a moving target, that this is a huge-scale effort that hasn't been undertaken before, but there are no specific timelines about when this equipment will be received and in what fashion.
and I think lacking that, it's difficult to know for sure that the needs are being met or will be met and for how long.
There is a big question hanging over everybody right now when itcomes to healthcare workers, personal protective equipment, the ability to do as many tests as possible, the ability to makesure that equipment is available.
I think we are still lacking thespecific timelines that would provide those assurances.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister did mention $2 billion to help purchase the personal protective equipment for bull you can purchases for the provinces and territories, which is different how it's happening in the United States.
They are competing amongst each other rather than having a coordinated response.
He said it will take a few weeks to get these companies that are switching over up and running.
That's why they're still receiving shipments from around the world and saying they are preparing for the worst-case scenarios, not the best-case, which is not nice to hear.
But you would prefer the government is preparing for the worst and know that there are companies who can create this stuff down the road.



**David**:

There are a couple of things to unpack.
The $2 billion is a commitment to buy.
That is not $2 billion already in stockpiles.
That is important to note.
We have a news release from thorn hill and they are going to produce 500 mobile ventilator units.
What the Prime Minister was saying about what is essentially total chaos on the international procurement market is the big challenge right now.
This industrial capacity to build ventilators, to make masks, to do gowns, to do hand sanitizer, that all exists in Canada, but it takes time to getready.
Maybe this can happen in two weeks to use a number, that is Short amount of time in the lifespan of a company and country.
That is not a short amount of time in the life cycle of a virus like COVID-19. The big question people have and that we're hearing from front line medical workers is there enough PMed PMed -- P.P.E. Where supply will no longer be an issue because you can accelerate it and no longer have it in place.
In the United States their hospitals are overflowing and they are scrambling and competing, hospitals in new york bidding against each other.
The ability to cooperate in a reasonable fashion with another country is highly unlikely I think given the state of play.
Canada has promised to buy theirfuture production while industryretools itself to do this made-in-Canada solution that theprime Minister is talking about.
Minister Bains has moved quickly.
The procurement Minister is the one under the gun because she iscompeting in the most intense marketplace where some countrieshave put trade restrictions on this equipment.
There is nothing coming out of the european union.
We have seen some coming out of china which has been sent back because it is defective.
Rosie, it's not just this wave.
We've seen in the life cycle of virus pandemics there can be a second and third wave.
It is going to be important to have this future domestic supplychain in case this comes back insome shape or form.



**Rosemary**:

That's again one of the reasons why the government officials and the prime minister telling people to physical distancing.
The more we can take the pressure off the health system, the less they will need these things.
One thing on banks.
It doesn't sound like the government is making any progress that they are willing to talk about with banks easing up on interest rates, whether with credit cards.
We've heard lots of problems around mortgage deferrals.
It's something to keep an eye on. I'm not sure why there is a lack of cooperation or what more the government can do to force their hand a little bit.
I know a lot of Canadians are struggling with those interest rates.



**David**:

Rosie, it could be the sequencing how they have to do the programs.
Floating the money could have been the first thing they wanted to get out the door and work on the interest relief.
One is important but could be number two on the list.



**Rosemary**:

We'll ask for questions about that from the finance Minister later today.
Thank you both.
We're back at the top.
We are hearing more cases in windsor-essex.
One-third of the cases are healthcare personnel who work inthe United States we did talk to a nurse from windso who was doing the back and forth work.
She was worried but seemed to bewell equipped.
This is the concern that healthcare workers get the virusand they bring it back into Canada.
What are the concerns.
Tell us more.



**Chris**:

Let's start with jennamalone, she crosses the border every day to go to work at a hospital in the United States.
Every day she comes back home, crosses the border.
She's an essential worker.
When she goes home, she changes in her garage, goes in a separate bathroom and wears P.P.E. In the common areas to not get her family infected.
Now there's a tension existing in windsor-essex about how can we make sure that our community stays safe and these healthcare professionals, approximately 1, 500 of them who cross every day to work on the front lines stay safe.
There were some new recommendations laid out and one of them is if someone is working across the border they stay in that country until their work week is over.
For jena, that would mean she goes to Detroit and stays there.
There was a pitch for additional screening at the border.
Temperature checks, stuff like that.
Our medical officer of health said that that screening already exists at the hospitals so they don't think that would be as valuable to find a way that these healthcare workers that are needed in Windsor and those in Michigan, to make sure that they're safe and there's no community transmission.
Again, as we deal with a third of our cases here in windsor-essex coming from those working in the healthcare systemin michigan.



**Rosemary**:

Let me bring people up to speed on where we are and what we are waiting for.
The regular noon briefing from federal cabinet ministers and public health officials.
The message from the government was on how to procure personal protective equipment for medicalstaff, front line health workers.
The Prime Minister naming a number of Canadian companies who have stepped up to switch over what they're producing in order to create a domestic supply chain for those medical supplies.
The government also offering up $2 billion to help purchase bulk purchases for provinces and territories that need help with that as well.
We are also expecting more details on the wage subsidy for 75% of wages for companies big and small that lose 30% of their revenue due to COVID-19. All those details still to come.
For now we will leave you on cbctelevision.
If you want to keep watching, we're on CBC news network and CBC News.
Ca. I'm rosemary Barton.
[♪♪♪]



**Rosemary**:

I'm rosemary bartonlive from Ottawa.
Welcome to CBC news.
You may be watching us on CBC news network.
You might be watching us around the world on the CBC news app Orin CBC News.
Ca. We are bringing you the latest COVID-19 coverage throughout theday.
In just a few minutes we will hear from federal cabinet ministers and public health officials on Canada's attempt to contain the pandemic and how we are responding.
We are also waiting today to hear more specifics from finance minister bill morneau about the economic response to the pandemic.
Just moments ago the Prime Minister thanked thousands of Canadian companies, 3, 000 or more, that have helped the government secure much-needed personal protective equipment, the masks, the gloves, the gownsthat frontline medical workers need to fight COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We know that the demand for critical equipment and supplies will grow in the comingweeks, so we need a sustainable, stable supply of these products.
That means making them at home.
We're optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.
So today I'm also announcing that our existing next-generation manufacturing super cluster will be leading companies in developing and scaling up new technologies to test and treat Canadians.
Demand for these goods is going up, so we're making sure Canada is ready to keep up. That's why our government is also allocating $2 billion to purchase personal protective equipment including for bulk purchases for provinces and territories.
This includes things like more masks and face shooeleds, gowns, ventilators, test kits, swabs, and hand sanitizer.
Personal protective equipment isessential to protect our healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of this fight.
We recognize that more is neededand everyone is working day and night to receive essential supplies.
We're coordinating with the provinces and territories, the public health agency, and the experts to make sure our healthcare workers get everything they need.
This is a priority for our government, and we will continueto source new solutions every day.
We're expecting shipments to come in in the coming days, and we will continue to work tirelessly to get the supplies to where they're needed.



**Rosemary**:

That's the Prime Minister's daily message and update for Canadians today.
"power & politics" host, Vassy kapelos, and David Cochrane are back.
I can't remember a time when Canadian industries have joined hands for the good of all Canadians.
I can only imagine a war time effort would be similar.
Will it be enough and will it be better which is the obvious questions with this pandemic and the questions you always ask.
We know, for instance, this weektheresa tam has said is a critical week, the next seven to10 days to see how we're doing to flatten the curve.
They want to have as many supply chains as they can in case things are the worst-case scenario.



**Vassy**:

It's hard to gauge, right, exactly what the need will be because it very much depends on the actions you and Ind every Canadian is taking right now.
That's the message we heard fro mall public health officials throughout the country over the past few weeks.
That's why staying home is so important.
What we continue to hear particularly from healthcare workers is in, in fact, this doesn't go as planned or as hoped and things are leaning towards more of a bad case or worst-case scenario, the need for that equipment will be greater than the supply.
That's not consistent everywhere, but it depends on the province and facility you'rein.
There are a variety of accounts from people working on the frontline.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.



**Vassy**:

At the same time, we hear the need is there.
The message today was aimed at that.
I do want to highlight the Prime Minister said the needs were covered as of now and in the foreseeable future, but obviously announced $2 billion towards procuring more of that personal protective equipment.
What we don't know is of the timeline of that equipment becoming available to Canada or how it gets into our hands if it will match up with the need.
We can't predict the need.
It's difficult to know if it will work out.
There weren't a lot of specifics provided by the government when that stuff starts coming in in the coming days.
There are a lot of factors that go into that, but we just kept hearing in the coming days.
We have assurances the needs will be met, but we don't know how great the need will be.



**Rosemary**:

They keep saying we are planning for the worst-case scenario and over preparing.
We'll take them at their word.
That is the question, whether these things line up. I would imagine that the modelling they are doing based on the data they're receiving from provinces, they're able to plot out what the worst-case scenario would be. It is interesting to hear from frontline workers the vast differences in different places.
We had an emergency worker on just before the Prime Minister spoke who felt totally safe and well equipped.
But we've heard from other nurses and hospitals where they're rationing masks.
Vassy, I'm going to get you to touch on this once more around the troops.
We spent a lot of time talking about it. We asked a lot of questions about it. Now it seems like it's not happening.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, so what the original discussion was is there was a proposal from the white house to basically arm, to militarize, the border between the United States and Canada.
The idea was 1, 000 armed forces about 30 kilometres back from the border.
That's what we were told was being discussed.
It had been brought up a few days prior.
In light of everything with COVID-19, the president of the United States discussed it, speaking that he wanted to have equal treatment of the southern and the northern border.
We know immediately federal government ministers, such as deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister harjit sajjan, the public safety Minister, bill Blair, began speaking to their counterparts about it and pushing back on theidea.
We were told by the new amends to the United States that it would send a really bad or signal, considering that the border is demilitarized at this point.
What CBC was able to confirm today is that that proposal is now officially off the table.
It had been reported in the "wall street journal" that they dropped the proposal and now it looks like we have confirmation that that is the case.
The United States is no longer moving forward with the proposal to armor militarize the border between our country and theirs.



**Rosemary**:

Such strange days and stories move very quickly and come up and die away very quickly.
I'm going to put you on pause for a minute as we wait for the cabinet ministers.
We have been checking in with Canadians who have been infected with the virus, including some on the mend because that's happening and that is a good part of this story.
One is Jesse Riviera.
How are you feeling?



**Interview**:

Pretty good.
Pretty much symptom-free.



**Rosemary**:

Tell us how you think you got COVID-19 and how you thought you might have it.



**Interview**:

I travelled to Scotland with My wife on March 6. We arrived in London where at the time everything was, like, normal -- there at least.
Obviously the world was already dealing with the coronavirus.
Everybody was just acting as normal.
There was no precautions being taken.
We were there a few days.
By the time I got to Scotland, is tarted to feel congested.
Nothing to the point of difficulty breathing, but definitely something that was out of the ordinary for me. Yeah, so kind of we just went through it. Then the calls came to come home.
So we cut our trip short.
That process, we were exposed TA lot of people through the airplane and the airport.
When I got home, I just felt this chest pain continued.
I got tested and came back as positive.
Then I realized that I hadn't been smelling anything for days and that's a symptom that wasn'tvery publicized at that point.



**Rosemary**:

So the testing partwas, what? because I've seen some diagrams of what it feels like and looks like.
I don't know how detailed you want to get.
How did it feel like for the testing part or non-invasive andno big deal?



**Interview**:

It was unfortunately.
For the importance of getting tested, I had a tickle in My nose for hours after.
That was basically the worst of it. They do put the swab deep in your nose.
It was surprising.
I didn't know that was going to happen.
It's a small discomfort to take for getting the results and being identified.



**Rosemary**:

So you -- what was the worst then that you were, just a chest pain or did you have a high fever or headaches or what else did you experience?



**Interview**:

This is a thing, as we learn more and more comingout.
Everybody kind of deals with this differently.
The fever, the cough, I think those are more aggressive symptoms that are happening a lot.
But in this case just a light pressure on My chest.
Obviously I lost the sense of smell.
If I would have known that was asymptom, that would have been a very clear indicator.
At times the pain was like so acute that I was worried that it could be doing damage to My lungs long term.
But thankfully on the 14th day towards the end, I got My smell back and the pain is gone from My chest.
It looks like I can be added to the 170, 000 people worldwide who have gotten through this or at least who have been tested and gotten through it.



**Rosemary**:

I don't think you're very old.
You don't mind me asking your age?



**Interview**:

I just turned 30 years old at the airport arriving back.



**Rosemary**:

There is a concern that young people aren't taking it seriously.
I don't know whether that was your concern.
What would you say to some younger Canadians who are -- whodon't think they will get infected or who don't realize that they could pass it along tosomeone? just a message I guess to people who are younger than I am, more your age.



**Interview**:

No, absolutely.
I think early on the messaging was that young people weren't going to be affected and all those things.
I think at least if you have a fear of getting ill yourself, generally if you're healthy you'll be able to get through it relatively unscathed.
But the thing is that you might have it and not know it. Then you might infect someone else and they might infect someone who is more vulnerable.
Just by you thinking you can go about your life regularly, you might be responsible for someonedying.
That's a huge, huge responsibility.
Whether or not you even have anysymptoms, you may be carrying it. You need to stay home, figure out a way to amuse yourself, and just be responsible.
Here you have a chance to actually make a difference and it's not through anything more labour some than staying inside and making sure if you go outside, to be smart about it. You can have no symptoms and still have this thing.



**Rosemary**:

Jessie, that's a good message for lots of people.
I hope you're doing better and your wife as well.



**Interview**:

Thanks very much.



**Rosemary**:

That was Jessie Riviera, now recovered from COVID-19, speaking to us from Montreal.
It's good to do some of the recovered cases as well because this can be a grim story.
To know that people are coming out the other side and doing better and okay, that's important to remember.
As we wait for cabinet minister sand public health officials, I'mgoing to go back to David Cochrane to pick his brain about what we can expect to hear from navdeep Bains and the Minister of procurement.
I'm not sure of her exact title.
They will tell us more about how quickly these new supply chains can come online.



**David**:

I think some specific son the numbers and amounts of the equipment they've secured contracts on. It's not in the government's news release, but we know from thorn hill medical that they will make 500 ventilators.
They usually make ventilators for battle-fields.
So they're going to retool.
The country is on a national mission to buy supplies and time.
The supplies are in this globally competitive market thatis really kind of crazy right now as they try to buttress the surge capacity that they have and what's already in hospitals, to buy the time until all these canadian companies are answeringthe call and retooling to deliver the supplies domestically and in bulk, but they need time to get ready -- oh, Chrystia Freeland is talking.
I should stop talking.



**Rosemary**:

No, I was going to cut you off.
Let's go to Chrystia Freeland.



We must stay strong and stay at home.
Unless you are doing essential work like stocking grocery shelves or working on the front lines of our amazing healthcare system, please stay home.
You can go for a walk or a run, but maintain your distance and wash your hands when you get home.
I know that this is very hard, but I also know that Canadians are resilient and I know that we can do this.
 [voice of interpreter] this is a critical week in our fight against the virus.
Canadians must practice social and physical distancing.
Remain strong and stay at home unless you're doing essential work such as stocking shelves or providing healthcare services.
You can go out for a walk or go for a run, but remain far from others and wash your hands when you get home.
I know this is very difficult, but Canadians are resilient and I know that we can do this.
[end of translation] today we will hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa tam, the Minister of public services and procurement, Anita anand, the Minister of science and innovation, navdeep Bains.
 [voice of interpreter] the president of treasury board and the vice-president of the cabinet committee on COVID-19, jean-yvesduclos.
[end of translation].



I'm going to give an update on the number of cases.
I'm going to use the number published this morning on our website.
This is a dynamic situation with different provinces announcing different things.
In Canada as of 9:00 a. M. this morning there were 7, 708 cases of COVID-19, including 89 deaths.
In addition at any point in time there are many other people under investigation awaiting labresults, or not yet testing.
Even if you're not hearing of cases in your community, it doesn't mean there are no cases and there are no exposures waiting to happen.
So we now have completed tests for over 236, 000 people in Canada, with about 3.5% of people confirmed as positive and over 93% confirmed as negative.
 [voice of interpreter] our greatest concerns at the moment relate to the introduction and spread of the virus in enclosed settings where vulnerable people reside.
We currently have a number of ongoing outbreaks in long-term care homes, cases in first nations and inuit communities, and a correctional facility.
These events are deeply troubling, both because they result in outbreaks that accelerate the spread of the virus, but more so because of the serious consequences of these high-risk individuals.
However, the young are not spared from severe outcomes.
Adults under 40 account for 10% of hospitalizations.
Just yesterday there was a report of an individual in their30s who died of COVID-19. [end of translation] of greatestalternate at the moment is the introduction and spread of the virus in enclosed settings wherevulnerable people reside.

Just yesterday there was a firstreport of an individual in their30s who died of COVID-19. We must prevent introduction into vulnerable populations at all costs, as well as prevent new travel-related cases from sparking community spread.
As all Canadians continue to strictly adhere to physical distancing to protect themselvesand others, we expect all travellers coming into Canada tojoin these efforts.
Moreover because of an increasedrisk of COVID-19 outside of Canada, the quarantine order requires these travellers go directly home upon arrival and quarantine themselves for 14 days.
We all need to keep up physical distancing while maintaining social connections.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Now we will hear from our Minister of public services and procurement, Anita anand.



[voice of interpreter] thank you very much and hello to everyone.
As we continue to work through this truly extraordinary situation, I want to thank Canada's essential workers.
Your work is helping to contain the spread of COVID-19 and we are incredibly grateful.
[end of translation] as part of these efforts, public services and procurement Canada is aggressively buying in bulk fro mall available suppliers and distributors.
To date, we have ordered millions of swabs, gloves, masks, and other vital equipment.
I'll take a moment now to highlight additional progress that we are making.
 [voice of interpreter] we have signed a contract with medic om to provide an important supply of surgical masks.
[end of translation] including this order, we have now managed to secure more than 157 million surgical masks to support the response.
To date, we have also ordered more than 60 million n95 masks, a key piece of protection for healthcare workers.
Delivery of these will begin this week.
 [voice of interpreter] we are also working with spartan, the ottawa-based company that will provide kits.
[end of translation] this will allow us to test many more Canadians over and above the millions of tests we have already ordered.
On ventilators, we have a significant order through thornhill medical in toronto, part of the 1, 570 ventilators that we have ordered from companies in Canada, europe, the United states, and overseas.
We are working to secure upwardsof 4, 000 additional ventilators and very possibly more.
Canadians have always risen to the occasion in times of challenge.
The companies with whom we are working from every region in Canada and abroad are clear examples of this important point.
I also want to thank suncor and home depot for stepping up with generous donations of personal protective equipment.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that this type of equipment is very important in order to fight against COVID-19. We will be investigating $2 billion additionally in terms ofpurchasing P.P.E. As well as bulk purchasing in coordination with the provinces and territories.
[end of translation] we know how important these supplies are to the fight against COVID-19. We will support the additional $2 billion investment in the public health agency of Canada to purchase personal protective equipment, including for bulk purchases with provinces and territories.
These funds will continue to be dedicated to purchasing the equipment necessary for our doctors and nurses, hospitals, and other front line health workers across the country.
 [voice of interpreter] our goal is to be as best prepared as possible andcanadians can rest assured that we're exploring every possible option.
[end of translation] I also wantcanadians to know that we are working together in these unprecedented times.
I have reached out to My provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we have strong and established lines of communication with regard to procurement in addition to the work that is already being done by ministers of health across the country.
 [voice of interpreter] I have reached out to My provincial and territorial counterparts to assure we have strong and established lines of communication with regard to procurement in addition to the work being done by ministers of health.
[end of translation] extraordinary measures are required in these extraordinary times.
To limit the spread of COVID-19, protect critical infrastructure, and ensure that Canada has the supplies required, our government is leaving no stone unturned.
It is all hands on deck right now.
Thank you.



Okay.
Thank you very much.
Now we'll hear from the minister of innovation, science, and industry, navdeep Bains.



Thank you very much.
a little over a week ago our government announced Canada's plan to mobilize industry to fight COVID-19.  [voice of interpreter] this plan aims to provide critical medical supplies and equipment to healthcare workers and prioritizes the health and safety of Canadians.
[end of translation] since then, we've achieved considerable progress.
As was just announced, we've advanced to the procurement stage with the three companies we highlighted last week.
On medic om I will say anything to the immediate mask procurement, we are in the process of finalizing an agreement to support the development of manufacturing capacity in Canada.
It's strengthening our domestic supply that remains a core objective of ours to make sure we have the ability to build these masks in Canada.
Another part of our last announcement included a call to action, asking companies to step up in this fight against COVID-19. While as of noon yesterday, we have received over 3, 200 e-mailsfrom companies and we have directly connected with over 2, 900 of them.
Whether it's companies with ready-to-go products, with products not yet authorized, or companies whose products need more development or need help scaling up. If you tell us you want help, we will connect you with the relevant federal support to makesure we increase domestic medical supplies so we have canadian solutions ready to protect and support Canadians.
We have now signed additional letters of intent with five companies who have signalled they can assist in the government's response to COVID-19, supplying testing kits, hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, and medical apparel.
As I said, we're refocussing ourindustrial policy and are deploying funds on an accelerated basis through shorter applications and faster approvals.
We're committed to this strategyto make sure we can do everything we can to help our healthcare workers.
 [voice of interpreter] it's been encouraging to watch companies rise to the challenge.
Often joining others to equip our healthcare workers with the tools and protection they need.
[end of translation] we're also bringing together industry partners, from the cosmetic alliance of Canada to canadian consumer specialty association and spirits Canada.
Together they're working to facilitate the supply of key ingredients to increase the manufacture of hand sanitizer.
Another step we've taken is advancing the next-generation manufacturing super cluster initiative which brings togethermore than 970 members into a Canada-wide manufacturing network.
It recently put out a call for proposals to its members and it's making $50 million available to develop and scale up new products and equipment that are in short supply.
Within 48 hours of issuing this call, the super cluster reviewedand additionally approved three projects for innovative manufacturers to produce ventilators, testing kits, and face shields.
It's My colleague mentioned, I want to recognize general motors, ford, linimar, suncor, home depot, Canada goose.
All of them have offered to don't personal protective equipment.
I encourage other companies to follow their lead in generously donating whatever they can in this challenging time.
Let me wrap up by reminding everyone that we're in this together and I'm proud of how industry has stepped up to fightcovid-19.  [voice of interpreter] we all have our role to play to flatten the curve and to support Canada's economy.
Thank you.
[end of translation].



Thank you, Navy.
 [voice of interpreter] and now I give the floor to the president of treasury board, Mr. Duclos.



Today we're doing an assessment of two important strengths, that is the capacity of the Canadian government to provide supplies and the capacity of the industrial network of this country to support this country.
So we've talked about this investment of $2 billion in procurement operations of the Canadian government to be able to buy medical equipment, tests, and accelerated tests in the purchase of P.P.E. and disinfectant and hand sanitizers in the possibility of buying medication to treat people who are ill and also to provide ventilators.
We're also speaking about the importance of mobilizing the production capacity of the government and of private companies throughout the country.
Thousands of companies are mobilizing to support the efforts of the canadian government, to support the healthcare and public health agency activities.
The government is working with public procurement Canada to ensure and accelerate this collaborative effort between companies and the canadian government.
Thank you.



So now we're ready to answer your questions.



So we're going to start from three questions from the phone.
[end of translation].



Operator.



If you have any questions, please press star 1 on your telephone key pad.
We have a question from michellelaflamme of radio-Canada.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] thank you very much.
I would like to know if your goal is to become self-sufficient for the production of P.P.E. Or to become self-sufficient regardingcertain equipment that's difficult to obtain on the international market and what are the deadlines that you're looking at.



I think that Anita and Navy will be able to answer those questions.



**Answer**:

Thank you very much for your question.
We're working and collaborating with the entire government and in partnership with provinces and territories and industry in order to obtain the goods and services that we need in this extraordinary period.
There are many things that we'redoing at this stage.
We're working through all methods possible to obtain all the essential medical equipment for Canada.
We're looking overseas as well to support provinces and territories and Canadians and healthcare workers as well.
So perhaps My colleague would like to add additional comments.



No, thank you very much, Anita.
Our strategy is very clear.
She's correct in that.
We're going to work with other jurisdictions in order to obtain the essential equipment that is required, but we also want to have a strategy for manufacturing here in Canada.
That's why today we announced that there are three companies that can manufacture the essential equipment here in Canada.
So our strategy is to try and meet Canada's national requirements, but also we're going to try and continue to buy essential equipment from elsewhere in the world.



Next question.

---

**Question**:

You talked about medicom.
You said there might be an agreement shortly to the production of new companies.
Could you be a little bit more precise in that regard.



**Answer**:

Yes.
We are going to invest a lot of money.
I can't confirm the amount at this point, but I hope I'll be able to do so shortly.
We're going to invest in a plantthat's going to manufacture essential equipment in Montreal only for Canadians at the time, but I hope that they'll be able to manufacture for other jurisdictions, but it's a priority for Canadians here.
[end of translation] we are going to invest in medic om through the strategic innovation fund to produce masks here for Canadians so we have domestic capacity.
The goal is not only to meet the domestic capacity requirement, but ultimately to produce masks for other jurisdictions in the future as well.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
The next question is from briar Stewart, CBC news.
Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

---

**Question**:

Thank you.
This question is for Dr. Tam.
I wonder if there is any national tracking going on regarding the number of healthcare workers that have become infected with COVID-19?



**Answer**:

Yeah, that's a very important question and it is part of the data that we wish to get confirmed by the provinces and territories.
So we're working very hard to dothat.
Of course we do know of a number of healthcare workers, particularly related to the long-term care facility outbreaks that you've heard about.
Some of the healthcare workers were the initial cases, followedby the residents.
So those are the kind of settings where that is going on. So we do have knowledge about those particular outbreaks.

---

**Question**:

I'm wondering as a follow-up, we've heard from other countries that are furtherdown the road that there are some times where doctors, as many as one in four, are off sick because of COVID-19. I'm wondering what kind of contingency plans are in place in Canada if that were to happenhere.



**Answer**:

I think protecting the healthcare workers in the first place is important.
It would go all the way from healthcare workers who travelled, we need to pay special attention to them, making sure that they're not sick and they're not spreading of course the virus in both their family context or in the hospital context.
That's really key.
Having processes to screen and stop infection from spreading in those healthcare institutions protects the health workers as well as the patients or the residences.
Of course the personal protective equipment that you'vejust talked about.
But as a health professional, I think we all have to also practice everything that we preach, including social distancing, protecting our patients and our family.
But for sure protecting the health workforce is absolutely critical.
Secondly, looking at surge capacity.
So with the provinces and territories having already engaged medical colleges, retired healthcare professionals, students who are studying in the medical professional field, and all of those engagements are now taking place with provinces already engaging that kind of surge capacity as they need to do, forexample, contact tracing for the public health side as well as surge for the healthcare system itself.
So that planning is extremely active right now so that we maintain that health workforce.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning.
Mr. Legault, the premier of quÉbec, yesterday said he might be trying to see what to do for those working in essential services.
Ms. Freeland, you were referring to people who are stocking grocery shelves.
He was looking to see how they might be compensated because they are paid on a minimum salary basis and they're earning less than what the c. R.b. Would provide to them.
Are you going to look at this option for the people who are underpaid in the essential services, that they're not put in a very unfair situation.



**Answer**:

Thank you very much for your question.
The priority for our government from an economic perspective was firstly to be certain that all workers can remain at home if necessary or to self-isolate or to help others or children who are not at school or other members of their family who might be sick or to help workerswho might have lost their jobs because of the impact of COVID-19. That was the first priority.
The second priority, and this iswhat the Prime Minister announced on Friday, we wanted to help workers at work to help companies to maintain the link between the employer and the employee.
This is what we did as well.
We understood that there are industries and sectors, including the essential servicessector, whereby there is a situation where our country has an extreme need for those peopleto continue working in the essential services sector, but at the same time there are economic consequences because ofthe necessary policies that havebeen put into place.
The federal government is in agreement with Mr. Legault as tot consequences of these policies.
We must find a fair way to treatall workers in Canada, includingthose people who are carrying out essential work, such as people who work in grocery stores.

---

**Question**:

Do you have a timeline or a goal in terms of the provision of a fair solution in the coming days, where -- or will people have to wait and see?



**Answer**:

What we have already said, these are extraordinary times and our government has understood that it's important to act quickly.
This is what the context requires.
However, one of the consequences of adopting policies more quickly than in a normal context is the fact that we announce a policy and we start doing something in relation to it, bu tin the following days we have to establish all the details surrounding such a policy.
This is exactly what we're doing.
Today I cannot announce the details concerning the situation that you have asked about, but Icahn tell you that we're in agreement with premier legault who is doing excellent work, that this is an excellent situation.
We must think about it and do something.
[end of translation].



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
We'll stay in the room.

---

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] -- that the United States on the basis of public health.
Given that you can speak independent of the government, I'm wondering if you think this will help public health, if thisis putting people at more risk, if we see people speak -- sneaking around without reporting.
and what did you advise the government about these crossings?



**Answer**:

I think both in terms of protecting whoever is crossing and the rest of the population is extremely important for managing this particular epidemic.
So I think from our public health perspective, whether to do the screening and making sure that together with CBS anyone who is sick is properly managed.
Of course a reduction in the number of travellers from any entry points can potentially reduce introduction of course tocanada.
So it's just a -- different layers of measure I think, but think that's partly it. and of course we need to look after each other on both sides of the border.
As much as we are working on ourside, I think the public health officials on the other side of the border are also managing anyone who is sick as well.

---

**Question**:

Minister Freeland, your government has talked about nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous people.
We are seeing some first nationsask for military support.
I'm wondering if they're under the thumb of the provinces, if there is a disagreement with theprovinces.
If you're going to work with a first nation -- we're expecting a flood risk in Manitoba this year.
I wonder if you would be prioritizing that over a military hospital in a first nations community.



**Aarti**:

Thank you very much for the question and thank you for your focus on indigenous issues.
Look, to the flood point, we are very aware that there are emergency situations in Canada every year, even in the years when we are not facing a global pandemic.
Minister Blair and Minister miller have been working very hard with their teams specifically -- and I should also say Minister sajjan.
We have been having discussions to prepare to walk and chew gum at the same time.
It's important for Canadians to appreciate that.
Floods happen every year.
We have been seeing more extreme weather events.
So we appreciate that we need to be ready to handle those potential extreme weather events, even as we continue to work hard to fight the global pandemic.
That is the particular responsibility of the Minister of public safety and he is definitely on it. The Minister of defence and d. N.d. is very, very focused on the military's particular role this season and this year to defend and support Canadians.
That's why we heard from them yesterday.
When it comes to indigenous communities in particular, Minister miller is very, very focused on the specific needs.
We heard from Dr. Tams -- tam just now that we need to focus on these indigenous and northerncommunities.
We are working with these communities to understand what they need and specifically what we will need to do to support them.
Nothing is off the table.

---

**Question**:

I think this is for minister an and and Bains.
Just going back to the companiesyou're working with to produce medical equipment and other equipment being procured internationally, when are we going to see these companies produce equipment and get that in the hospitals, specifically timeline on that.
and are we going to allow these companies to produce equipment that we then sell internationally or donate to other countries around the world?



**Answer**:

I'll begin and then hand it over to Navy.
Thank you for the question.
I want to begin by talking about what we do at public services and procurement every single day, 24/7. We are purchasing a broad range of personal protective equipment.
We've received already masks, surgical, and n95, gloves, swabs, and additional masks in the future.
We are taking an aggressive and proactive approach to procurement every day.
We are working 24/7. This country has never seen procurement like it is occurring right now.
It is broad-based and aggressive.
On that basis, I will say that the timeline is among.
We are engaged in procurement immediately as well as in the long term to ensure that Canadians have the equipment that they need to keep frontlinehealthcare workers and beyond safe.
In terms of the particular companies, we are expecting supplies this week, ventilators in particular.
I will turn it over to nav, who can continue with the explanation.



Thank you very much, Anita.
Just to build on what Anita has said.
We are dealing with global demand.
and we recognize the global supply chains have an enormous amount of pressure and they are unstable.
That's why we are partnering with industry to build capacity.
The medic om example is an example of building up that capacity.
The primary objective of providing essential equipment for Canadians.
So these are Canadian companies that are retooling to provide solutions to Canadians, particularly for front line healthcare workers and to support our healthcare system.
So that is our number one objective.
In the long term, if we're in a position to build up such significant domestic capacity to help other jurisdictions, I think it's incumbent on us to consider that because this is a global pandemic.
This is not just about protecting Canadian lives, but we have a responsibility to other countries.
Our primary objective is to recognize that global demand is going up, global supply chains are unstable.
We need to build up domestic capacity.

---

**Question**:

So they are mandated to keep what they are producing in Canada for Canadians?



**Answer**:

We are in an arrangement with them to help them retool or rescale, clearly the objective is to make sure we meet with the demands and requests made by the provinces and territories.
That is the objective.
Saying we are going to help you scale up or retool so that you can provide those essential medical pieces of equipment, personal protective equipment, for Canadian front line healthcare workers.
That is clearly the objective.
As I was saying in the long term, as Minister an and just mentioned, some of this equipment is going to be made available in days, not weeks.
Down the road if we're in the fortunate position where we have the ability to help other jurisdictions out, we will consider that.
The number one priority is to supply Canadians.



That was a follow-up --

---

**Question**:

My second question was --



One question and one follow-up.

---

**Question**:

My second was about there have been numerous reports in Europe about masks coming from china being defective.
The Chinese embassy here donated they were donated some masks.
is there work being done to make sure the masks we get from china are functional and effective?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question.
That question pertains to goods across the board, not just to china.
Public health has specification sand requirements that need to be met in order for P.P.E. To be distributed and utilized safely for frontline healthcare workers.
I will say once the shipment comes in and I'll ask Dr. Tam ifshe would like to add in on thispoint, there is inspection to make sure that the specifications are met.
In addition, we are making sure that in china there is quality control on the ground there.
I have been in close touch with ambassador dominic barton actually every single day to make sure that we have people onthe ground in china who are assisting us with our procurements there.
They are performing an excellentand useful service for canadianson the ground in china.
and that makes the procurement process in many, many respects much more smooth.
Dr. Tam.



Yes, I can confirm any kind of donation, we will need to make sure it meets the standards in Canada.
Health Canada has posted the criteria and guidance, but each of those donations will be checked in terms of whether they meet the standards.

---

**Question**:

I'm not sure if this is for ms. Freeland or for Dr. Tam.
We know that about a third of the 65 positive COVID-19 cases in windsor-essex are canadian healthcare workers who cross theburroed, they work in detroit and come back with the virus.
is it time to stop the back and forth?



**Answer**:

I'll start because last night I had a good conversation with the mayor of Windsor about precisely this issue.
He is very focused on it, as are the local M.P.s. He has been in very close touch with all -- he reported to me that he's been in close touch with both the canadian hospitalsand the United States hospitals.
It's a measure of how closely intertwined our economies are that there are in windsor both canadian healthcare workers who every day cross the border to work in detroit.
There are also people who cross the border from the United States every day to work in the canadian healthcare system.
Stepped-up measures have been put in place at the hospitals, both on the United States and Canadian side of the border, to very carefully check the health of the healthcare workers, to be sure when they go to work and when they leave work that they are healthy and well.
and also, opportunities have been offered to them if they would prefer not to go home to their families, to be able to stay in hotels close to where they are working.
So a lot of very hard, very important work is being done on the ground in Windsor.
I really want to say the mayor is completely on it. I want to thank him for his hardwork.
It is a situation that we are monitoring closely and we need to monitor closely.
We are going to continue to do that every single day.
If Dr. Tam wants to add something.



I think just to add that we're also connecting with Ontario and the public health officials in terms of the procedures and guidelines that they're putting in place as well for healthcare workers, but not much more to add.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

My second question is to either ms. Freeland or to Dr. Tam.
Again, the fact that for the past few days everyone has been saying this is a crucial week to see if physical distancing and staying at home and self-isolating is working.
I guess the question is what happens if it's not and infections continue to rise, is there a plan b?



**Answer**:

Look, I'll start just to say we all need to be prepared for the reality, which is the situation is going to get worse before it gets better.
That is the unfortunate truth of where we are right now.
I'm delighted by the way you framed your question, because it shows that people are understanding that we can actually make a difference.
You know, we mustn't be fatalistic about this.
If we take the right actions, we can have the least bad outcome for Canada.
Taking the right actions means first and foremost Canadians every day practising physical distancing.
This is a particular kind of crisis where every single person in the country can make a difference.
I know that people are trying really hard and I can't emphasize too strongly the need to do that.
I think the first answer to the question is let's do everything we can, and each one of us has power here, to avert the worst-case scenario.
Having said that, of course it is incumbent on all of us in government to do everything we can to prepare for a less good outcome.
That's why you've heard to do from anita and nav on the truly extraordinary efforts we're making in procurement internationally and getting canadian companies who have beenterrific working hard to build what we need at home.
I also really want to commend the work of premiers across the country.
To give you a sense of how focused the premiers are on being ready for worst-case outcomes.
I can tell you that just this morning I was on a conference call with doug ford and francoislegault which premier ford organized on his phone to work on procurement.
and I had a text with premier Horgan also with specific questions.
This is a real Canada-wide effort.
The premiers are doing extraordinary work.
We are getting ready for a less good outcome.
At the same time, even as we saythat, let's all of us remember that what we need to do today isdo the best we can to avert that.
I think we would all love to hear from Dr. Tam as well about this.
[ please stand by ]



**Doctor**:

So we've been thinking of how do we make sure that every jurisdiction has the resources they need to do that contact tracing.
Contact tracing is quiteintensive.
If you get a cluster oroutbreak, you're going to have to trace all of the people who may have beenexposed.
It is a really, really important aspect.
So doubling down on that.
Also, the concept of reducing and extinguishing this is predicated by the fact that we want any infected individuals to not pass it on to more than one person.
If one person that is infected passes it on totwo, your epidemic willcontinue.
So that is an ultimategoal.
To do that, this is why --essentially physical distancing is so important for Canadians because you want to reduce that risk of transmission.
and that's why that aspect of the response is soserious.
So you've seen across the country the public health system beginning more and more to restrict those movements in some way.
So mass gatherings, when we started, absolutely youshouldn't be going to conferences or these massgatherings, and it went down to 250 and then 50, and now pretty much everyone saying, we need to really buckle down and do our maximum physicaldistancing.
Making sure vulnerable populations stay home and support them, so thatthey're not at risk ofinfection, potentially in the community or othersettings.
and all of the sort of essential services, having them make sure, grocery stores or other places where people do have tovisit, are also practicing social distancingmeasures.
That is so important.
That's where, I think, youknow, as we speak, we'restill enhancing thosemeasures.
and we'll want to exceed those absolutely.
and then, of course, at the same time, preparing for the scenarios where you can increased influx of patients.
Alternative sites for evaluating patients.
How do you help people who are mildly sick but can'tbe self-isolating at home, having hotels and otherthings.
Homeless shelters cannotmanage these outbreaks.
So you need alternativesites to manage andisolate people from thosevulnerable settings.
All of this is happeningright now.
So I think -- that's why isay this week, again, double down and keepgoing.
and it's a whole ofsociety response.



Thank you.
Operator, we'll take three more questions on thephone, please.



Thank you.
The next question is fromremont.
Please go ahead.




**Caller**:

[speaking throhinterpreter]good afternoon, everyone.
The doctors and nurses onthe front lines, and thehospitals as well, areafraid of a lack of masks.
Premier legault is talkingabout a lack of the masks in the next three to sevendays.
is there a danger in thatregard?



**MERCÍ BEAUCOUP.[Speaking thrhinterpreter]ANSWER**:

Thank you very much for your question.
It is tremendously important to have mask sand other equipment for doctors and people who are working on the frontlines.
and I want to assure you that we obtained masks, different types of masks for the workers.
[end of translation]



As I mentioned, we have ordered 60.9 million n95masks, and 157.5 millionsurgical masks, and someof those are beingproduced right here incanada.
[speaking throhinterpreter]so it is tremendouslyimportant, and we'reworking extremely hard toobtain the equipment forcanadians.


---

**Question**:

But my question is whether there is a danger of a lack ofmasks? is there a danger or risk of a shortage? 



Answer:[speaking throughinterpreter]at the moment, we'reworking night and day topurchase masks.
[end of translation]



and we're working very hard to make sure we have that equipment to distribute not only toquebec, but to every single province in thiscountry.
I will add that our efforts are supplementary to the efforts that individual provinces themselves are making.
and so, say, as chrystiafreeland said, we'reworking as a country, with the provinces, every single day, to make sure that we have the equipment that front line healthcare workers require to keep our country safe and to fight against COVID-19. 



Answer:[speaking throughinterpreter]if I can reassure you, what you're hearing thismorning is that theprocurement capacity ofthe canadian governmentand the industrialcapacity of Canada aremobilize to overproducematerials and equipment, to ensure that we have themaximum production ofP.P.E. and other equipmentthat health care workersabsolutely need.
Of course we're supportingthe work and the essentialactivities that that theprovinces, including thequebec government, areundertaking because weknow that there issufficient supply, butthere is this currentconcern of beingoverprotected andoverproducing, such thatthe industrial capacity ofthe country can providesufficient quantities ofP.P.E. Thank you very much.



Next question.
[end of translation]



The next question is from Philippe franÇois.
Go ahead.



Caller:[speaking throughinterpreter]just to clarify what youjust said, I'm not sure iunderstood.
Are you able to say thattwo weeks from now, if wehave an increase in cases, as we're seeing at thispoint in time, that twoweeks from now all thenurses, doctors, andpatients who need aventilator will have thenecessary equipment? is that you're telling us, in two weeks, three weeks, everybody will have theequipment? we won't need to makedifficult decisionsrelating to ventilators?



**Answer**:

What we'resaying is we have to produce the maximum capacity of Canada'sindustrial abilities.
So we're going to produce great amount in the next few weeks.
At the same time, we have an individual responsibility to the bestscenarios.
At the same time, thecanadian government best mobilized all of the industrial capacity of the country to ensure we have the maximum of resources in the coming week, and such that we'll be ready for any type of scenario that might arise.[speaking throhinterpreter]

---

**Question**:

But I guess ask one question --



One question, only.



I'm sorry.
I miscounted.



**Caller**:

Followupquestion: can we say tocanadians that the government promises we'llhave equipment for theworst-case scenario?



**Answer**:

We're having trouble hearing you because of the break up in your speech.
But at the same time, what we can say is that thecanadian government is ready to mobilize as if we were at war.
and so we're mobilizing all of our efforts, industrial and the government efforts, to ensure that the equipment is provided to province sand territories in the coming weeks.
We're working with the provinces and the territories to ensure that that equipment is available at the righttime.
and we have confidence in that collaboration between the government and theprovinces, and, of course, when we're talking about the worst-case scenarios, we hope if they were tooccur, that they would bethe best-case scenariopossible.



Next question.



The next question is from michelle.[speaking throughinterpreter]

---

**Question**:

My first question is for ministerfreeland.
I'm wondering if you have an update to provide(indescernable) to thecountries of origin whenthe United States sendsthem back.
Do you have anyinformation in thatregard?



**Answer**:

I can tell you that this is significant and important issue for us. The work is continuing on. I was speaking to ministerblair last night and this morning regarding thisissue.
He is very committed andengaged, as if our ambassador Holman in the United states, who is engaged in this issue wit hour American counterparts.
and I can reassurecanadians that the government takes seriously our international obligations concerningasylum-seekers.
and Canada will never doanything that will goagainst those obligations.



**Caller**:

Mr. Declaude, question: when we talk about the role of the banks in establishing interest rates for the credit cards, sometimes they are 20% to 30%interest rates.
What would you like to see from these large bank of banks to ensure Canadians don'tbecome further indebted.



**Answer**:

, what we want to do is that the banks are committed to deferring interest and capital payments onmortgages.
People are often stuck anddon't have the means to pay their mortgage as they would do in normal times.
But what we're expecting from the banks anddesjardins is not only to be aware of the precarious situation of many families in Canada, but also to ensure that the way in which they provide loans through credit cards or other means, be adapted to the present context.
We know that credit cards lead to very high interestrates.
In normal context, people would have trouble reimbursing those interestrates.
So we're expecting that they would offer to individuals other means to pay back their loans and to pay lower interest rates in the coming week sand months.
This message has been explained to the banks anddesjardins, and we hope that this message will lead to practical situations for families throughout the country.



One last question on the phone.



The next question is from Christ from the"globe and mail". please go ahead.
[end of translation]



**Caller**:

Hi, goodafternoon.
Thanks again for doingthis.
My first question is fordr.
Tam.
Right off the top you mentioned specifically now cases within Inuit and first nations' communities.
I'm just wondering if you could please provide anymore specifics on which communities you're talking about confirmed cases.



**Doctor**:

Yes, there are a number ofcommunities.
I mentioned yesterday thatnunavik, which is in the northern aspects ofquebec, have experienced their first case.
and some large firstnations' community inontario, and also, believe in some of the prairie provinces.
Even one case in any of these communities is extremely serious.
and the leadership in the communities have taken very rapid action in terms of social distancing and restricted measures within the community.
and, of course, colleagues from indigenous servicescanada are in close touch to look at what means there are.
But those -- and also, as we are reporting, not necessarily specifically indigenous communities, but the north of Canada, so Yukon and northwest territories both havecases.
and they are introduced into the community fromtravelers.
and all of those northern territories are taking very aggressive public health measures to try to prevent introduction, and also adapting what social distancing means in thosecommunities, particularly where they have crowded living conditions, looking for alternative sites, forexample, in managing theirsituation.
and, also, the health system is also revving up to look after differentpatients.
and having very close planning with provinces linked to them in terms of medical care andtransportation.
So all of that planning is being done.
But any single case in those communities, we have to really take it extremely seriously.



**Caller**:

and just as afollowup, the indigenous file is a big part of the work I'm hearing.
and some leaders, forexample, in northernontario -- I've heard they have zero test kits in some communities.
and I'm just wondering, you know, if we can'tfigure out who hascovid-19, if there are no test kits available, how can we really get a handle on how widespread this is and also treatment? I know testing is an issue in a number of different parts of the country, but it seems as though there is serious concern from leadership about their capacity to test at all.



**Doctor**:

Yeah.
and it will be linked to the bigger system of the provinces and territories as well.
But, I think there is absolutely a gap that we have to fill because even the samples have to be flown vast distances tolaboratories.
So one of the priorities we have right now, andwe're evaluating some testing mechanisms where they can do that much closer to the patient, and so the maximum microbiology lab is now actually doing some of those tests on those much more -- on the patient test kits that can be used.
That is actually happening right now.
and we'll give you more information as thatprogresses.
The goal is then to equip the territories or the more remote areas with their own capacity so theydon't have to transferspecimens.



Thank you, doctor.
Thank you, everybody.
[end of translation]



**Chrystia Freeland**:

and this brings the press conference to an end.



The main message was about how the federal government is working with private industry to ram pup procurement of medical equipment that will be needed now and in the weeks ahead.
While we were doing that, Quebec was giving us abriefing, where they have732 new cases, an additional six deaths.
We want to take you now totoronto.
The Ontario government is speaking about its response to thecoronavirus, and notably that schools will continue to be out until may 4th.
Here is premier Doug ford.



**Premier**:

We'reworking closely with the school boards to find ways to help students complete the school year.
So they can advance to the next year and earn credit sand graduate.
We're easing the financial burden on university and college students and their families by providing asix-month grace periodthrough the ontariostudent assistantprogramme.
These new measures willhelp students continuetheir studies and gettheir diploma.
We'll get through this forour students, forfamilies, and for seniors, for everyone.
and we will succeed thanksto the outstanding effortsof our many Ontario heros.
This isn't about ourgovernment.
We have an army behind us. An army of 14.5 millionpeople, the hard-workingpeople of this greatprovince.
That's what keeps me goingday in and day out.
That's how I know we willget through this.
The frontline health careworkers coming in dayafter day, the businessesand workers who arestepping up, keeping vitalparts of our economygoing, and retooling andmaking essential suppliesright here in Ontario.
The teachers going aboveand beyond to keepstudents learning.
and, most of all, everysingle person out therethat are taking ouradvice, staying home anddoing their part.
We all need to be rollingin the same direction.
and together we will getthrough this.
Thank you and god blessthe people of Ontario.
I'll hand it over tominister lecce.



**Minister**:

Goodafternoon, everyone.
[end of translation]



**Minister**:

As the premier made clear, we will do everything it takes to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19. and take the recent advice from Dr. David Williams, our government confirmed public schools will remain closed until may 4th.
We're taking the next steps to provide continued learning for our children, that will keep students learning while at home.
[end of translation]



**Minister**:

The second phase of "learn at home" creates some predictability for ourparents, students andeducators.
We're providing expectations that parent scan count on. We're enhancing support for students.
We're ensuring theteacher-studentrelationship is restoredthroughout this period.
Our aim is to provide all of them when some sense ofsecurity and hope duringthis extraordinary period.
The first is to keep yourchild safe, and the secondis to keep them engaged inlearning.
I know nothing about thesituation ideal.

I really want to give them to ourresearchers.
We have a lot of researchers right now inquebec who are working night and day to be able to find medication, vaccines, and I'm thinking about the doctors, amongstothers, at the institute of cardiology.
I would like to give out message in his name.
Right now he needs thousands of participants for his research, for hisstudies.
It takes people who havecovid-19, people who areinfected.
So we're going to put the coordinates of the doctor on the government'swebsite.
But it could allow us to save lives.
So if you have COVID-19and you acceptparticipating in this verypromising research of thedoctor, I would like totake this opportunity tothank all of theresearchers, the men andwomen who have beenworking on a lot ofdifferent projects, andwho we hope are going tolead to something fruitfulvery quickly.
and I would like to endwith: don't go out unlessit is absolutelynecessary.
If you do go out, keep twometres between you andanother person.
and when you come home, you wash your hands withsoap for 20 seconds.
I think that if we respectthat plan, we are going to be saving the lives ofquebecers.
So it is worth doing it, and I count on you.

**Premier**:

My biggest concern right now is for the medical supplies.
Currently, for some equipment we have only for three to seven days.
New shipments should arrive in the next fewdays.
and I want to thank myfriends, premier dougford, who accepted this morning to transfer us some equipment.
So thank you very much.
I want to thank, also, Prime Minister Trudeau and deputy prime ministerchrystia Freeland.
They are working very hard to secure some orders in other countries.
So thank you very much.
It is very appreciated.
and it is really the top priority right now, to make sure that we'll have enough medical supplies and the next few weeks.
and I want to ask again to the health professionals, please use only the supplies when it isnecessary.
So to get through thisfight, we must remain United.
Today I ask quebecers to give a call to someone who is alone.
I know a lot of people are currently suffering fromisolation.
a phone call can make a big difference for them.
We must also continue to follow our threepriorities: one, don't go out unless it isnecessary.
Two, if you do go out, keep your distances.
and, three, when you comeback home, wash yourhands.
That all will save lives.
Thank you all.
[speaking throhinterpreter]thank you, Mr. Premier.
Now for the questionperiod.
