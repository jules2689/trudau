**Vassy**:

a couple of things that you highlighted and that is the procurement update.
Last week Minister Bains, the Minister in charge of this file, said we are retooling the industry to fight against COVID-19. We are expecting an update from the Prime Minister and Minister Bains and which companies have been retooled.
What can Canadians expect, will it be personal protective equipment and ventilators.
We have seen those discussions ongoing in the United States.
Expect those details today.
Apparently there are also some companies we can expect.
For example, home depot.
I don't know the exact specifics of what they are donating, but there are some corporations in this country and outside of this country that have stepped-up andare going to be announcing through the Prime Minister todaydonations of that kind of medical equipment or personal protective equipment.
Stay tuned for that.
I think we're not going to hear a lot from the Prime Minister onthis, but we are eagerly and I think many business owners eagerly awaiting more details today.
We were promised they were coming around qualifications forthe big announcement they made last Friday and updated yesterday, where business healthis concerned, that's the wage subsidy up to 75% of wages, no limit on number of employees.
We have no idea how the subsidy will be measured.
a lot of business owners saying they've been closed and wondering how this will apply.
The questions persist and we've been told to anticipate answers from the finance Minister, but we don't know when.
I think those will be questions until they get answers.
a lot of people anxious about that.



**Rosemary**:

Those details supposed to come from the finance Minister and other ministers, not at the noon briefing from what we understand, but some critical questions for the businesses, small, medium, large, who are hoping to tap into the wage subsidy as an attempt, as we talked about before, to keep that connection between the company and the employee and get things back up running quickly once this is all over.
It will end at some point.
We do have confirmation now for Ontario parents and students that school won't be back for Ontario's students until at least may.
So that's how things are looking in this province and I expect other provinces will get updates as they are containing the outbreak.



**David**:

Companies stepping up for procurement, I don't know the specifics, but I know Doug ford had been speaking with the head of home depot.
Stuff such as masks.
The masks they have are similar to those that are used in hospitals.
There are supplies that exist for industrial work that can be redeployed for medical work.
We are seeing examples of that from the private sector across the world digging into their stockpiles and contributing to the national effort against COVID-19. One think about bill morneau is that he is self-isolating because of contact with a u. N. official that later tested positive for COVID-19. That is partly right and partly wrong.
He did have contact, but that was 20 days ago.
He is self monitoring, not self-isolating and it is 20 dayssince the contact happened.
When we do hear from him, as Vassy said, we are awaiting for the criticals details from him and the Minister ng about the wage subsidy announced.
The 30% revenue drop is one thati know all of us have had a lot of questions about on Twitter ore-mail, how exactly is it going to work, how do I prove this.
Do I have to provide a financialstatement.
My understanding from speaking with senior government officialsis this is going to be a pay first, ask questions later, likethey are doing with the CERB andgetting money to people.
There will be compliance work done after the fact where they will look and see if you had a revenue drop.
If you didn't hit the threshold, you would see some repayment, either partial or full whether you needed this subsidy.
If there is an attempt to rip off the government, the Prime Minister said there would be significant consequences.
I don't think the intent is to make it labourious for people.
They want to get cash out the door.



**Rosemary**:

a couple of things about bill morneau, he is self monitoring.
This is attached to this meeting with the executive director of the world food program, but it happened on March 11. There is not much concern about things.
He has no symptoms, he's at goodhealth, and he will be at the announcement for the wage subsidy today.
We don't know when that will happen.
a lot of businesses asking about tomorrow being April 1 and that being a concern if you are a renter but also a concern if you lease a place for your business.
There have been questions about whether the federal government should do anything more there.
The federal government's response would be that's why we've offered $40, 000 in loans interest free, with $10, 000 forgivable.
That's why we've offered more opportunity to credit through the business development bank ofcanada and EDC To try to provide that credit to extend your ability to stay in your place of business.
I know that's on the minds of lots of people, but that's the response.
I'll put you both on hold as we wait for the Prime Minister.
There have been three more deaths from COVID-19 at a nursing home in Ontario.
12 residents have now died from the virus at the pine crest nursing home in bobcaygeon, bringing the total number of deaths at that facility to 13. a woman whose mother died there speaks to us.



It makes it difficult to grieve because the whole world is involved.
It's like your parent or your person is in the press and it's a big thing.
It doesn't allow you to be with what's happening, which is you lost your mom.
I've been lucky because My mom is 82 and in My peer group most of My friends have lost their parents already.
I had her for a good, long time.
I didn't want to lose her without being with her.
That is the hardest part.



**Rosemary**:

This is one of the concerns of public health officials that COVID-19 gets into these vulnerable populations in nursing homes.
We saw that in British Columbia and now we're seeing it in bobcaygeon, 150 kilometres northeast of Toronto.
Chris Glover is standing by there.
It seems grim, Chris, with the number of deaths and workers infected.



**Chris**:

Rosemary, it certainly is grim and that uneasiness is settling in with a lot of the residents I've been speaking with here in bobcaygeon, especially as they learn these numbers continue to rise in this small town a couple hours north of Toronto.
We know the virus has claimed, as you mentioned, 13 lives.
The fear is that number could still rise.
The medical director at this facility behind me says many of the other patients and resident sat this facility are also showing symptoms and some of them are in critical condition.
Her concern is certainly that there will be more deaths.
But you also mentioned the staff.
It's true, there are several staff members, at last count 24, who are sick and many of them are off sick.
As a result, the province and nursing organizations and associations have had to step up to get some reinforces here to help with the sick and the dying.
and the thank yous are also pouring in from officials and residents in town.
There have been cars driving by and honking horns.
Yesterday at 7:30 p. M., just like we've been seeing displays across the country, last night at this facility there was a cavalcade of vehicles playing music, some had their windows down and were waving.
Some of the staff came out and waved and said thank you.
It was a beautiful tribute.
I was speaking with one resident who said it feels good to see so many stepping up.



**Rosemary**:

Chris Glover in bobcaygeon, Ontario.
I appreciate that.



> I want to bring you a view of what it's like in another way.
Dr. David Carr is an emergency room physician in Toronto.
Good to see you, doctor.



**Interview**:

Thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Thanks for being here.
Tell me what it's like to work in an e. R. right now.



**Interview**:

Yeah, it's different times [ indiscernible ] -- if terms ofhow things are.
It's frightening.
Most of us love what we do and being an emergency room doctor is frightening.
It's changing day-to-day and it's hard as we're trying to keep pace with the knowledge.
As it evolves, we're on the frontline.



**Rosemary**:

We're just about to hear from the Prime Minister we expect about companies in canadastepping up to make equipment that you need.
What's the state now, do you have everything you need in terms of personal protective equipment? is.



**Interview**:

Yeah, I think at the current moment I feel safe working and showing up to work.
Social media is a powerful enemy and a weapon.
You see other countries and their experiences.
You hope that we have what we have.
It's not like Canadians to rely on the private sector and privatation, but we need to know as front line physicians and nurses we have what it takes to effectively treat patients.



**Rosemary**:

You say it's frightening doing your job.
I can't imagine doing your job.
What is so frightening?



**Interview**:

It's frightening of the unknown.
We've seen cases of meningitis, tuberculosis, we know scary diseases, but we have a history behind those and we know what toexpect.
I think the unknown is frightening.
When you see 10% of the Italian epidemic is healthcare workers, we're concerned.
We're doing what we can to protect our workers, we just need to know that we have it. is it frightening? sure, because we never want to bring that stuff home.



**Rosemary**:

How are you mitigating work life and what might be happening there and coming home and making sure your home life is safe?



**Interview**:

It's a balance.
Our house has turned into a hot and cold zone.
I'm not laundering any of My clothes anymore.
Wearing scrubs and disposing them at the hospital.
Meticulously hand washing, coming through a separate entrance and wiping everything down and not seeing My loved ones until I decontaminate at home.



**Rosemary**:

How are your familymembers, do you have kids or a family, do they get what's goingon? do they understand why you have to do that?



**Interview**:

Yeah, we have kids.
The most comfortable thing for us as parents is we believe children do well.
My kids are school-aged kids.
I don't have worries for their health.
I want to keep My parents safe.
Now you have time with them.
This is a time to engage with them.
We've got to be there to mitigate what is really affecting them, which is a really big adjustment in their lives.



**Rosemary**:

I'm waiting for the prime Minister and I may cut you off and excuse me if I do. How is this virus different than what you've seen before.
What is the thing you're seeing people try to deal with that is most troubling to you?



**Interview**:

I think what is different and having gone through SARS at the start of My career is we're seeing asymptomatic transmissions.
People don't know they have it and can spread it. One of the challenging things is the real heroes of this disease are the people watching TV, not the healthcare workers.
Unfortunately we've been brought up in a society where you go to your physician, physician's assistant, nurses, they help you, give you medications, get you better.
What gets you better is preventing you from getting the disease in the first place.
We need to push through the social distancing.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister is up. It's not just the people watching the TV that are brave, it's also you.
Take good care.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Families and loved ones continue to grieve and seek answers.
I want to assure them and all Canadians that we have been working hard to get accountability and justice, even as we fight this pandemic.
At the same time, we've also been developing a strategy with other international partners to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.
Today I'm appointing the honourable Ralph goo dale as the person responsible with the downing of flight 742.
Ralph has the right expertise to guide us through this disaster and to inform on best practices going forward.
He will continue to push to see families properly compensated.
The second thing I want to do is to share a story with you.
a few weeks ago Dave caputo, the owner of a start-up in the waterloo region called a meetingwith his employees.
With mounting concerns around COVID-19, dave asked his team how they could repurpose their factory to make products hospitals needed.
a few days later they had four prototypes drawn up. They decided to make large panels that hospitals could use to subdivide rooms and isolate patients with COVID-19 from other patients.
On Monday panels made of fully recycled materials were delivered at no cost to several hospitals in the region, including grand river, st. Marys, and guelph general hospital.
Dave and his team showed what Canadians do in difficult times.
We don't back down from a challenge.
We roll-up our sleeves and we get to work.
I know that this pandemic has been incredible challenging for people right across the country, but we're also seeing the best of what it means to be canadian.
From coast to coast to coast, businesses are retooling to produce face shields, ventilators, hand sanitizer, andother supplies our healthcare professionals need to make it easier for companies to help outduring this critical town, we launched Canada's plan to fight COVID-19. We've spoken to over 3, 000 companies who offered their help.
Before we go further, I want to thank all the companies who offered to help.
This vital support comes at a critical time.
When you say how can I keep myself safe in this time? this is a sign of leadership andwhat Canadians do best.
In tough times we pull together, we're there for each other, we put up our hands and ask how we can help.
I want in the same vein to thankeveryone making, shipping, and delivering these products.
People who work in the manufacturing sector in terms ofgetting people the items they need are on the frontlines of this fight.
Our country needs you through these tough times and we thank you deeply for everything you do.  

[voice of interpreter] I want to announce the plan to mobilize industries to fight COVID-19. We said we were reaching agreements with numerous companies.
Today we are announcing the signature of supply contracts with these companies to manufacture medical equipment such as respirators, surgical masks, and other materials.
Minister Bains played one of theforemost roles in making this happen.
We have signed letters of intentwith a number of other companies.
By mobilizing industry, we can produce the goods that are needed by our healthcare professionals right here in Canada in order to protect theirhelp, to protect other patients, and to stop the spread of the virus.


[end of translation] we said that we were close to reaching agreements with thornhill medical, medicom, and spar tan bioscience.
We are moving forward with contracts with these companies to make medical equipment.
I want to recognize the great work Minister Bains has done to make this happen.
We've signed letters of intent with precision biomonitoring, irving oil, calco group and stalfield.
We know the demand for supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stablesupply of these products.
That means making them at home and we're optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.
So today I'm also announcing that our existing next-generation manufacturing super cluster will be leading companies in developing and scaling up new technologies to test and treat Canadians.
Demand for these goods is going up, so we're making sure Canada is ready to keep up. That's why our government is also allocating $2 billion to purchase personal protective equipment, including for bulk purchases with provinces and territories.
This includes things like more masks and face shields, gowns, ventilators, test kits and swabsand hand sanitizer.
Personal protective equipment isessential to protect our healthcare workers who are on the frontline of this fight.
We recognize that more is needed, and everyone is working day and night to receive essential supplies.
We're coordinating with the provinces and territories, the public health agency, and the experts to make sure our healthcare workers get everything they need.
This is a priority for our government and we will continue to source new solutions every day.
We're expecting shipments to come in in the coming days and we will continue to work tireless to get these supplies to where they're needed.
 

[voice of interpreter] a number of companies have donated medical equipment to fight COVID-19. Ali baba sent up 500, 000 surgical masks and 10, 000 testing kits to help us. The group COVID-19 medical groupthat brings together engineers, entrepreneurs, and other healthcare professionals is working with a number of companies to provide medical equipment.
Up until now, they have been able to get a commitment from bombardier, 3m, and metronic to produce personal protective equipment.
Toys "r" us has pledged to provide monitors for babies so there can be better communications between patients and healthcare professionals.
Those monitors will also help toproduce unnecessary travel within the facilities.
I want to thank the many companies who have made a donation for their leadership and generosity.
You are doing your share and allcanadians will have to follow your lead.


[end of translation] we will need more masks, ventilators, and testing kits, but how many more we need depends entirely onyou.
If you stay home and follow public health recommendations, you can slow the spread, and that means fewer patients in ourhospitals, fewer people to test, fewer ventilators to use on critical patients.
So keep doing your part and helpus keep Canada safe.
