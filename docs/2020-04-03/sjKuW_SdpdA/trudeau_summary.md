### Summary:


With mounting concerns around COVID-19, dave asked his team how they could repurpose their factory to make products hospitals needed. They decided to make large panels that hospitals could use to subdivide rooms and isolate patients with COVID-19 from other patients.
From coast to coast to coast, businesses are retooling to produce face shields, ventilators, hand sanitizer, andother supplies our healthcare professionals need to make it easier for companies to help outduring this critical town, we launched Canada's plan to fight COVID-19. We've spoken to over 3, 000 companies who offered their help.
Before we go further, I want to thank all the companies who offered to help.
People who work in the manufacturing sector in terms ofgetting people the items they need are on the frontlines of this fight.
Our country needs you through these tough times and we thank you deeply for everything you do.  

[voice of interpreter] I want to announce the plan to mobilize industries to fight COVID-19. We said we were reaching agreements with numerous companies.
Today we are announcing the signature of supply contracts with these companies to manufacture medical equipment such as respirators, surgical masks, and other materials.
We have signed letters of intentwith a number of other companies.
By mobilizing industry, we can produce the goods that are needed by our healthcare professionals right here in Canada in order to protect theirhelp, to protect other patients, and to stop the spread of the virus.
We are moving forward with contracts with these companies to make medical equipment.
We know the demand for supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stablesupply of these products.
So today I'm also announcing that our existing next-generation manufacturing super cluster will be leading companies in developing and scaling up new technologies to test and treat Canadians. That's why our government is also allocating $2 billion to purchase personal protective equipment, including for bulk purchases with provinces and territories.
Personal protective equipment isessential to protect our healthcare workers who are on the frontline of this fight.
We recognize that more is needed, and everyone is working day and night to receive essential supplies.
We're coordinating with the provinces and territories, the public health agency, and the experts to make sure our healthcare workers get everything they need.
We're expecting shipments to come in in the coming days and we will continue to work tireless to get these supplies to where they're needed.
 

[voice of interpreter] a number of companies have donated medical equipment to fight COVID-19. Ali baba sent up 500, 000 surgical masks and 10, 000 testing kits to help us. The group COVID-19 medical groupthat brings together engineers, entrepreneurs, and other healthcare professionals is working with a number of companies to provide medical equipment.
I want to thank the many companies who have made a donation for their leadership and generosity.


[end of translation] we will need more masks, ventilators, and testing kits, but how many more we need depends entirely onyou.
If you stay home and follow public health recommendations, you can slow the spread, and that means fewer patients in ourhospitals, fewer people to test, fewer ventilators to use on critical patients.
