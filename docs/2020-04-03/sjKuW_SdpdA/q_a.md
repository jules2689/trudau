**Question**:

Yesterday you were asked about pipeline construction continuing on the trans mountain expansion and you said you would have a better answer today.
Now Jason Kenny is saying construction will start on the keystone pipeline as early as April 1. You're concerned about construction continuing on theseprojects.



**Answer**:

I can assure you that all crown corporations are following all the best medical advice.
 [voice of interpreter] I can assure you that all crown corporations are following all the advice provided by our medical professionals.

**Question**:

Yes, that didn't really answer My question.
I guess that means you're comfortable with construction continuing.
My follow-up question is about the wage subsidy.
You initially promised it at 10%, and then last week it was hiked to 75% and seems to be targeted to small- and medium-sized businesses and now it's available to all businesses.
Why have you taken such an incremental approach to this measure, given that you've askedemployers to hire back employees?



**Answer**:

We're putting in place unprecedented measures to respond to the needs that people are expressing on how we are going to be able to get through this together and stay home, self-isolate, not go into work, and yet still be able to pick upour economy when we're through this particular crisis.
That is the focus we've had and that's what we're offering is a 75% wage subsidy to companies large and small, non-profit sector and charitable sector included, so that people can stay on the payroll while they stay home and stay isolated, so that we can ensure we do bounce back strongly from this once we're through this period.



Next question, mike lansfield, "the Canadian press." your line is open.

**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
You talked about shipments coming in the coming days and the fact that more will be needed obviously.
So I think what I'd like you to do, is can you walk us through your decision-making process around the cabinet table.
How you decide how these squaresmedical resources will be allocated in the coming -- in the near future.
How precisely in detail do you decide what goes where?



**Answer**:

Thank you, mike, for your question.
It's a good one.
I can tell you we don't decide around the cabinet table.
It is not politicians who decide how resources are allocated.
We rely on experts, on medical officials, on coordination between medical officials in all different provinces to make the determination on where things are most needed.
We follow the direct advice of medical experts in terms of how to ensure that everyone everywhere has the equipment they need.



Follow-up question.

---

**Question**:

Yes.
So what input then are you looking for from provinces and municipalities as they struggle with this.
and this ramp-up production, does this mean this has to be a made-in-Canada solution and we can't rely on imports?



**Answer**:

We continue to work closely with the provinces phonowhat the needs are, what the supplies are, where potential gaps might be depending on trend lines and modelling.
We are in constant communication to ensure that the resources needed in different parts of the country will get there when they're needed.
On the second question, yes, on procurement, the entire world is trying to get its hands on the various equipment needed to fight this virus.
That is why we know that it will be important to have made-in-Canada solutions.
I am incredibly, incredibly proud of canadian companies, Canadian suppliers and manufacturers who are stepping up and saying, we want to help.
We will make ventilators.
We will help make masks and gowns and all the things that weare going to need in the coming weeks.
It has been a truly amazing and inspiring story to see how many factories and manufacturers are stepping up. In the meantime, we are continuing to work very hard on procurement solutions to get theitems that we need for the coming weeks.
 [voice of interpreter] first of all, I'm very much inspired by what canadian companies and manufacturers are doing.
We recognize that there is a huge demand right around the world for this equipment, and it's important to have made-in-Canada solutions so thatwe can meet our own needs in theweeks and months to come.
In the meantime, we are working with the provinces to look at their needs and to coordinate all of that work so that they get the necessary equipment whenand where they need it. At the same time, we are workingon delivering that equipment in the coming days.

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to know what kind of assurances have you been given from companies, the five new companies you just announced, that this material will be available in time in order to meet needs.



**Answer**:

We are trying to expedite all those processes, but we also recognize that it will take a little bit of time, probably a few weeks, before that equipment arrives from our Canadian manufacturers.
That's why we are continuing to receive shipments of material from around the world.

---

**Question**:

Yes.
and with respect to the company producing n95 masks, how many masks are ready now or will be ready very soon?



**Answer**:

Number of that information, but I know that there will be a press conference following this one where more information will be available about procurement.

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to come back to construction work that is proceeding on t. M.x. You say that they are following medical advice, but there are some workers who are very worried about these people coming back into the region.
Why not suspend that work to protect the residents?



**Answer**:

Well, we know that indigenous communities in canadaare very vulnerable, and that's why special measures are being taken right across the country to ensure that COVID-19 does not spread to those communities which are already quite stressed in terms of their own medical system and the number of people who live in housing units.
So we know there's more that needs to be done.
Now, with respect to construction work, I am confident that the company is taking all the necessary steps to keep people safe.

---

**Question**:

My follow-up is on another topic.
Now, with respect to the emergency benefit, now you're saying this will amount to $2, 000 a month, but what about someone who is on minimum wage, are you not concerned that somebody or some people will want to get that benefit rather than continuing to work?



**Answer**:

Well, this is a very difficult situation.
What's important is to ensure that people can self-isolate andtake whatever steps are needed to stay safe and keep their families safe.
At the same time, we know that there are some jobs that are more essential than others.
I'm quite confident that by working with the provinces that we will be able to ensure that what needs to be done will be done and that Canadians have themoney them need to continue to pay their rent and do their groceries.
This is something we will continue to work on together.
[end of translation] we recognize that people need moneyto be able to stay home and pay their rents and be able to buy groceries.
This is a situation that is unprecedented and it was really important for us to get money into people's pockets quickly.
We recognize that there are going to be challenges around certain essential services.
We're going to work with provinces and encourage people to find solutions that will allow people to stay safe while they continue to do the job theyneed to do.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, I'mwondering, you've talked a lot and your cabinet ministers have talked a lot about there being enough protective gather for healthcare workers, but we're hearing from them that they're being rationed and they're afraid to go to work.
How do you explain that difference?



**Answer**:

One of the issues we're faced with is we're looking at a number of differentmodels, where worst-case scenarios are dire, but this is something we think we will be able to manage.
I think healthcare workers and everyone needs to keep in mind what the potential worst-case scenarios are.
That's why it's important for usto prepare for every eventualityand be careful and responsible about how we use the equipment we have, but also impress upon Canadians how important it is that the decisions you make today, how and whether you do goout, will have a direct impact on the need healthcare professionals will be facing a week from now, 10 days from now.
That's why it is so important for everyone to keep pressure off our healthcare workers by staying home and making choices that keep us safe.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] just as afollow-up, we have nurses that are saying that the hospitals are telling them to take those masks, to take them home, wash them, and bring them home the next day.
is there such a serious shortagethat healthcare workers should be endangering their own health?



**Answer**:

Well, I think we have to be prepared for any eventuality.
I think that's the responsible thing to do. We are looking at ways of assuring that we have a proper supply of all equipment based on potential scenarios in the coming days.
I can assure you we are working to provide shipments of other equipment and we are working with Canadian companies to produce more equipment.
Once again, we are reminding Canadians that the choices we make today will have a direct impact on the demands placed on our healthcare system.
That's why everyone has to do their part.
[end of translation] it is extremely important for everyone to do their part and stay home so that we are not overwhelmed in our healthcare system.
We are looking at a range of models that could lead to a different outcome.
We're preparing for the worst-case scenarios, but working towards and hoping for abest-case scenario, that entirely depends on citizens being responsible in their choices.
As for decisions made by medicalprofessionals on managing the supplies that they have, I can only salute them for the work they're working so hard and the decisions they're making to keepus all safe as a country and to keep themselves safe so they cankeep keeping us safe.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] now, at the international level, there is a mini war where people are trying to get equipment.
Does that concern you? do you think Canada could end up with a shortage? are you concerned about that?



**Answer**:

Well, I think there are a lot of things of concern to us in this situation, the health of all Canadians is My primary concern.
and of course the health of our healthcare workers who are trying to keep us safe.
We are working with our embassies internationally to ensure a proper supply of other equipment, and we expect to receive more equipment in the coming days.
We will continue to be there to accept those deliveries, but at the same time it's very important to mobilize industry so that we can get that equipment produced here in Canada and have our own supply chain mobilized here in Canada.
That's exactly what we're doing now.
Again, I want to thank Canadian manufacturers and businesses who have stepped up to adjust their production and provide that equipment if it's needed for Canada and around the world.
[end of translation] we are of course working hard to make sure we receive shipments of needed supplies in the coming days.
I can assure you that our embassy staff around the world is strongly engaged in exactly that.
That's also why it is so important that we have made-in-Canada supply chains to provide us with this essential equipment for the coming weeks, for the coming months.
That's why I am so pleased to be able to thank the manufacturers and producers across the countrywho have switched their production over to making this necessary medical equipment because it will ensure that we have solutions in Canada that Mr. Cover our needs.

**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
The Americans are said to be most aggressively scooping up personal protective equipment on the international market.
I'm wondering if you've found that to be the case.
If so, have you prevailed on president trump to work together to come up with a common north American strategy, if you can ship ventilators and other equipment across the continent to priority areas?



**Answer**:

We are working hard to ensure Canada receives the equipment we need, in the short and medium term, creating production facilities to ensure we can cover our needs.
We understand that countries around the world are taking their own approaches.
We will continue to coordinate as much as possible, but every step of the way our priority will be ensuring that Canada is able to take care of its own.

---

**Question**:

Are you working with president trump on a north American strategy? also, can you tell us exactly how much medical gear has been deployed and delivered so far?



**Answer**:

We have been able to cover all our needs up until this point and expect to be able to cover our needs for medical equipment in the foreseeable future, but that is why it is important to ramp up productionle as well and with the United States we continue to coordinate on a broad range of issues.
 [voice of interpreter] we will continue to coordinate our efforts with the United States on many different issues, but our priority will be to ensure Canadians have the equipment they need to stay safe and health.

**Question**:

With rent due tomorrow, many small- and medium-sized businesses are worried about paying their landlords.
What can the federal government do? is rent forgiveness on the table?



**Answer**:

We've worked with cmhc to make sure rents and mortgages can be deferred.
We've put money in the pockets of Canadians at 75% that will take off this pressure.
We've made available a $40, 000 loan for small businesses that will be available for the banks interest free for the first year.
and $10, 000 under certain conditions will be forgiven at the end.
There are direct measures for companies to get the liquidity necessary to get through the coming months so we can be strong once we get through this crisis at the end of it.

**Question**:

Two first nations communities in Manitoba and other communities are requesting military hospitals be set up. is this something the government is contemplating?



**Answer**:

We know the men and women of our military are always ready to serve and help in a broad range of ways Canadians who need that support.
Field hospitals is certainly a capacity that the Canadian armed forces have.
We will all make determinations about how and where we can best help if it comes to that.

---

**Question**:

Canadians of course are putting lots of money on their credit cards.
They're raking up interest.
Last week you said you would talk to banks about deferring that interest.
Any movement on that?



**Answer**:

Those conversations continue with the banks.
We're looking at ways to easing credit for individuals so they can shift their bank and credit card balances to a lower-interest line of credit.
These are things we are continuing to work on because werecognize Canadians don't want to come through this with impossible levels of debt and we're going to help them out.

---

**Question**:

In french, please.



**Answer**:

[voice of interpreter] we recognize that it's important people not come out of this crisis in even more debt than before.
That's why we provided the emergency benefit and the wage subsidy for businesses to keep people on the payroll.
We also know that we can work with the banks and that's what we're currently doing, in order to try and get some changes with respect to credit cards.
We're also looking at easier access to credit for individuals so that if they borrow money, it will cost less.
