Ca. We are expecting to hear more information from the Prime Minister about the efforts to procure personal protective equipment, that is the equipment needed by medical personnel inside hospitals to stay safe, all of those needed in the front line fight against COVID-19. The government said they are working hard to build the federal stockpile for provinces that feel they don't have enough.
I think we have a shot of rideaucottage, the Prime Minister's home, where he is continuing hisself-isolation.
He is expected to speak to us at11:15 eastern.
Let me bring in Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane to join me now.
a couple of updates in terms of where things sit in the country.
Ontario has now extended its provincial state of emergency bytwo weeks.
We're expected to hear more information today about school closures here in this province, in Ontario.
I will say that yesterday Ontario had 351 new cases in oneday alone, and that's the largest single-day increase since the outcome.
Important to remember that thosecases reflect history rather than the future, but the fact that there are more cases speaksto a couple of things, communityspread, more testing, and the fact that Ontario lags behind some other provinces in that testing, including qu√âbec, British Columbia, and Alberta.
Vassy, what are we thinking we'll hear from the Prime Minister?
