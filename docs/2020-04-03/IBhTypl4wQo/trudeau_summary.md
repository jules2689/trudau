For the past few weeks, our government has been working closely with industry to produce the supplies our healthcare workers need, like masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and test kits.
 

[voice of interpreter]   

[voice of interpreter] -- so I can confirm that the Canadian armed forces will be there for -- a few week snow COVID-19 

[ indiscernible ] -- the consequences of COVID-19, but some families are having an evenmore difficult time.


[end of translation] there are food banks that can help.
Like most organizations, food banks are facing new challenges because of this pandemic.
The staff at the neighbour to neighbour food bank in hamilton told us they are getting more and more calls and it is overwhelming for the volunteers spread thin and working overtimeto help their community.
The work being done by their food banks and their volunteers is essential, so there's no question that they need more support during this crisis.
If you have the time and abilityto help, reach out to your localfood bank and ask them how you can help them.
At the same time, I'm announcingthat the government will provide$100 million to meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including those living in indigenous and northern communities.
This money will ensure that organizations with buy and deliver food to those who need it the most.
It will help support organizations that you may already know, like food banks Canada, breakfast club, the salvation army, and many more.
We see you and we are grateful for the incredible, tireless work you do even in these extremely difficult circumstances, especially in these extremely difficult circumstances.
You are doing essential work forour most vulnerable.
 

[voice of interpreter] today I am announcing that the government will invest $100 million to meetthe urgent food needs of the most vulnerable, including thoseliving in northern and indigenous communities.
This money will help food banks to buy and deliver provisions tothose who need them.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, food banks have been facing specific challenges.
Food banks and charities are doing an incredible job in our communities.
I'm thinking of the town of vilier that I'm familiar with where people are working hard tohelp their neighbours in My riding of Papineau.
If you are able to help, I invite you to get in touch with these organizations in your neighbourhood.
They need your help.
With today's announcement, we are supporting a number of organizations you may already know, the breakfast club and thesalvation army.
In fact, I want to take this opportunity to thank all the volunteers and organizations fortheir excellent work.
You're limited in terms of your resources, but I know you will continue to help your neighboursand to help people who need help.
We are investing in food banks so you can meet the urgent needsof your family during this crisis. Credit to help those whose income is low or modest.
We said that adults who are eligible would receive up to $300 or $150 per child starting in May.
I can now confirm they will receive that help this month in April. Credit to help low-incomepeople.
But I can now confirm that help is coming sooner, this month, April, instead.
Our government has been working with major banks to deliver benefits, including the CERB, through direct deposit.
Effective today people should visit their bank's website for information on how to enroll fordirect deposit if they haven't already.



We've been working very closely with the Americans to highlight what Canadians know very, very well, that the level of integration between our economies goes both ways across the border, that we are receiving essential supplies from the United States, but the United States also receives essential supplies and products and, indeed, healthcare professionals from Canada every single day.
I think of the thousands of nurses, for example, who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every single day. It would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back and forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.
