**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Before we get into things, I have two pieces of news to share with everyone.
The first one is the distribution of critical equipment to provinces and territories.
For the past few weeks, our government has been working closely with industry to produce the supplies our healthcare workers need, like masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and test kits.
Today I can announce that our government has signed an agreement with amazon Canada to manage the distribution of this equipment to the provinces and territories.
 

[voice of interpreter]   

[voice of interpreter] -- so I can confirm that the Canadian armed forces will be there for -- a few week snow COVID-19 

[ indiscernible ] -- the consequences of COVID-19, but some families are having an evenmore difficult time.
If you lost your job, if you're no longer receiving a paycheque, you're wondering not only how you can pay your bills at the end of the month, but how you can buy grocery stores the next day.


[end of translation] there are food banks that can help.
Like most organizations, food banks are facing new challenges because of this pandemic.
With everyone staying home, theyhave fewer volunteers.
a difficult economic climate means they are receiving fewer donation than they normally would while demand rises.
The staff at the neighbour to neighbour food bank in hamilton told us they are getting more and more calls and it is overwhelming for the volunteers spread thin and working overtimeto help their community.
The work being done by their food banks and their volunteers is essential, so there's no question that they need more support during this crisis.
If you have the time and abilityto help, reach out to your localfood bank and ask them how you can help them.
At the same time, I'm announcingthat the government will provide$100 million to meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including those living in indigenous and northern communities.
This money will ensure that organizations with buy and deliver food to those who need it the most.
It will help support organizations that you may already know, like food banks Canada, breakfast club, the salvation army, and many more.
On that note, I do want to take a moment to thank all volunteersand organizers.
Thank you for feeding our communities.
We see you and we are grateful for the incredible, tireless work you do even in these extremely difficult circumstances, especially in these extremely difficult circumstances.
You are doing essential work forour most vulnerable.
You are showing what it means to be canadian, to be there for each other in times of difficulty.
 

[voice of interpreter] today I am announcing that the government will invest $100 million to meetthe urgent food needs of the most vulnerable, including thoseliving in northern and indigenous communities.
This money will help food banks to buy and deliver provisions tothose who need them.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, food banks have been facing specific challenges.
For example, most of their volunteers are people who are retirees and who are more at risk of being infected.
That means fewer people to servea larger clientele.
Food banks and charities are doing an incredible job in our communities.
and they do so all year long.
I'm thinking of the town of vilier that I'm familiar with where people are working hard tohelp their neighbours in My riding of Papineau.
If you are able to help, I invite you to get in touch with these organizations in your neighbourhood.
They need your help.
With today's announcement, we are supporting a number of organizations you may already know, the breakfast club and thesalvation army.
In fact, I want to take this opportunity to thank all the volunteers and organizations fortheir excellent work.
You are feeding our communities and we very much appreciate everything you are doing.
It's not easy.
There is a great deal of demand.
You're limited in terms of your resources, but I know you will continue to help your neighboursand to help people who need help.
That's what we do at difficult times.
We're there for each other and we will be there for you.
I know there are many of you whoare going through difficult times.
The pandemic is creating a lot of uncertainty and you're worried.
But I want you to know that yourgovernment will not abandon you.
We are investing in food banks so you can meet the urgent needsof your family during this crisis.
At the same time, we are offering financial assistance topeople who have lost their jobs or paycheques because of COVID-19. We are introducing the Canada emergency response benefit that will give you $2, 000 a month.
Our government will also increase the g. S.t. Credit to help those whose income is low or modest.
We said that adults who are eligible would receive up to $300 or $150 per child starting in May.
I can now confirm they will receive that help this month in April.


[end of translation] our government is supplementing the g. S.t. Credit to help low-incomepeople.
We said in May every qualifying adult would receive up to $300 with $150 for each child.
But I can now confirm that help is coming sooner, this month, April, instead.
Our government has been working with major banks to deliver benefits, including the CERB, through direct deposit.
Effective today people should visit their bank's website for information on how to enroll fordirect deposit if they haven't already.
 

[voice of interpreter] I know many of you would like to know how much timethis will list.
You want to know when you can see your friends, hug your grandparents, or have people over for dinner.
Last night I had a discussion with the premiers of the provinces and territories and wetalked about data sharing and projections.
The good news is that many more people are being tested and experts have new data to analyze.
The provinces and territories are updating their information and will be publishing the latest data very soon.
On our side, we're working hard to verify the latest figures so we can put them online.
You can consult Canada.
Ca/coronavirus to get thebest updated information about the spread of the virus.
I'd like to be able to tell you exactly when all of this will beover.
I often talk about weeks and even months, but the reality is that it will depend on each of us. The best way to minimize the impact of COVID-19 is to continue to follow public healthdirectives.
You know them.
Stay home as much as possible.
Limit your movements.
If you absolutely must leave home, keep a distance of 2 metres from other people.
Continue to do your part and I promise you, we'll come through this.
I would like to close today witha message for young people and children.
On Sunday I will be holding a video conference online with Dr. Tam.
You can send me your questions today at the radio-Canada website and I will be looking forward to answering your questions on Sunday.


[end of translation] on Sunday, I'll be holding a video conference focused on you with Dr. Tam.
So send me your questions through cbc kids website BC the end of the day and I look forward to answering you this weekend.
 

[voice of interpreter] thank you all very much.


[end of translation].



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll go to the phone lines for one question and a follow up.

---

**Question**:

Hello, Prime Minister.
I have a question regarding [ indiscernible ] --



**Answer**:

I'm sorry, Kate, your line is cutting out a little bit.
Can you try and speak closer to the phone and a little more clearly.

---

**Question**:

Yes, no problem.
Can you hear me now?



**Answer**:

That's better.

---

**Question**:

My question is regarding the OPEC meeting on Monday.
is Canada planning to meet with [ indiscernible ] -- opec [ indiscernible ] -- according to the output levels and what [ indiscernible ] look like.



**Answer**:

I can assure you that we have been coordinating closely with the United States and other allies in looking at the challenges faced by OPEC right now.
We recognize that these catastrophically low oil prices are having an impact on many people's economies and, indeed, on Canadian oil sectors.
We're trying to coordinate to make sure that we are not facing the kinds of challenges in our economy.
We continue to support workers across the country.
We will continue to work internationally to try to impact on the difficult decisions made by OPEC over the past weeks.
We will keep you posted on that.

---

**Question**:

and what is happening with the support package for the oil sector we'vebeen hearing about?



**Answer**:

We're continuing to work with provinces, with particularly the province of Alberta, to ensure that we're giving support to workers who are in particularly distressed industries.
The wage subsidy and the Canada emergency response benefit will be of help to people right across the country, including in the oil sector, but we recognize that certain industries are facing much greater stresses than others.
We will continue to work with that with the provinces.
I can highlight that in our conversation last night, the premiers and I did discuss this.
I heard directly from premier Kenny and others on the importance of support to the oil sector and we're going to continue to work with them.



Thank you.
Next question.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
We are hearing that the United States administration has asked 3m to stop exporting n95 masks to Canada.
Can you give us more details about what you know.
Were you aware of that decision? and how will Canada respond to it?



**Answer**:

Well, we are working very closely with the United States at this time so they understand what we already know very well, which is that trade between Canada and the United States goes in both directions, particularly when it comes to essential goods and medical personnel.
There are thousands of nurses inwindsor who work in Detroit every single day.
Americans depend on them.
There are medical products and other essential goods that move across the border in both directions.
It would be a mistake for both of our countries to limit access -- either one's access to goods and essential personnel.
That is exactly what we're pointing out to the United States administration, and we will continue to work to ensure that what we need will arrive.
[end of translation] we've been working very closely with the Americans to highlight what Canadians know very, very well, that the level of integration between our economies goes both ways across the border, that we are receiving essential supplies from the United States, but the United States also receives essential supplies and products and, indeed, healthcare professionals from Canada every single day.
I think of the thousands of nurses, for example, who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every single day.
These are things that Americans rely on and it would be a mistake to create blockages or to reduce the amount of back and forth trade of goods and essential services, including medical goods, across the border.
That is the point we're making very clearly to the American administration right now.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] you were supposed to follow up with Washington with respect to the fact that masks are being diverted.
I just want to come back to whether Canada will respond to the United States.



**Answer**:

I can tell you that we will continue to keep trade open with the United States.
Both of our countries depend of that trade of essential goods and services on both sides of the border.
We will make sure that continues to flow and encourage it in these times of difficulty.
Of course we will be following up on concerns about shipments that have been diverted, but at the same time we continue to receive what we need.
[end of translation].



Thank you.
Next question, operator.



Next question from the Toronto star." line open.



**Answer**:

You might be on mute.

---

**Question**:

Yeah, I am. Sorry.
Thanks for taking the question.
Can you clarify.
Last night the order came from trump to 3m company to cease their exports to Canada and you've spoken about how valuable it is. Have you since then put in a call to the president? do you have one planned today? you said it would be a mistake, but it is a done deal, is it not?



**Answer**:

3m has indicated it understands how important it is to continue delivering on orders to places like Canada because there is much trade that goes back and forth in essential services and it could end up hurting Americans as much as it hurts anybody else.
That is the point we are making directly and have been making for many days to various levels of the American administration and that message is getting through.
 [voice of interpreter] 3m has said that it would be a mistake to limit trade in essential materials because all countries need to receive those supplies from beyond their borders.
It would not be advantageous for the United States or Americans if supplies from Canada and elsewhere could not come in. So this is something we're pointing out forcefully with the United States administration right now, including this morning.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

As a follow-up, youdidn't indicate whether you haveor will speak to the president today, but I would like to understand from your perspectivejust how big a gap this leaves Canada's supplies of these crucial medical masks.



**Answer**:

We continue to be confident at a we're going to receive the necessary equipment.
We understand that there are pressures across our healthcare systems in various regions on the dwindling supplied.
That's why we are working so hard to make sure we get the right supplies to them in the right time.
We have seen a number of Canadian companies stepping up their productions which will be flowing soon.
We are receiving more shipments from places around the world.
We will do everything we can to make sure no part of Canada goes without essential supplies in facing this pandemic.



Thank you.
One more question on the phone.

---

**Question**:

Hi there, Prime Minister.
You've been imploring people to stay home if they can.
You've been asking people not Togo to work.
Given that, why are you still sending civil servants to run immigration detention facilities, when that could increase the risk to those not only detained at the facilities but also the workers who have to return to their families.
Do you consider that an essential service?



**Answer**:

We recognize there are many essential services that continue to be delivered.
We are going to continue to ensure that essential services get done.
Wherever possible, civil servants are encouraged to work remotely and from home.
We know there are significant things that need to be worked onto deliver for Canadians to keepcanadians safe at this particular time.
I want to take the opportunity again to thank the public service for all it does in these difficult times to keep Canadians safe and secure.

---

**Question**:

It's not really a question of safety when you're locking up those who may have overstayed a visa.
Your government has continuously said you're looking on it but nothing has happened yet.
Why are you dragging your feet?



**Answer**:

I can inform you that action has been taken.
We are working closely with corrections Canada and detention facilities of all types to reduce the vulnerability to the spread of COVID-19 to ensure that measures are in place to keep Canadians safe.
We continue to look at other measures that can be taken.
We will take those measures in due course.

---

**Question**:

Prime Minister, on the issue of 3m you're saying if the United States goes ahead of this, it could hurt Americans also because of the flow of supplies across the border.
Are you considering any retaliatory measures against the United states?



**Answer**:

We are discussing the importance of keeping the flow of essential goods and services for both of our countries.
I am confident the close and deep relationship between canadaand the United States will hold strong and we will not have to see interruptions in the supply chain in either direction.
 [voice of interpreter] we will continue to point out to the Americans that it is in the interest of our two countries to continue to share essential goods and services.
This is very important for all of us, and that's why I am confident that we will be able to continue to rely on each other in the midst of this significant crisis.

**Question**:

Within the hour Ontario officials are going to reveal their projections on the number of cases and number of fatalities you might expect in the province.
Dr. Tam said the federal equivalent of those models are being used to inform your policydecisions, requiring Canadians to dramatically alter their way of life.
Don't you have an obligation to follow premier ford's lead and release projections on the worst-case and best-case scenarios about how many of us might die?



**Answer**:

We have been releasing information every single day on data received from the provinces, updating it regularly on websites so Canadians can see the latest numbers and look at various models, use those numbers to make various projections.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the projections we will be releasing are based on the most accurate, the deepest, the most properly collated information out there.
We are working with the provinces to be able to build a robust model to give the projections that people want to see.
People are wondering how much longer is this going to last? how many Canadians are going to be severely affected? these are things we will be sharing with Canadians, but we want to make sure we have a better grasp on the accuracy of the data before we put projections out there.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that Canadians want to know how long it will take and how long we'll have to continue to self-isolate, how many canadianswill be affected, how many people will die, and we will be sharing that information.
But before we can do that, we have to base ourselves on various specific data, precise data, and better data than we have now.
That's why we're working with the provinces to look more closely at that data and analyzeit so we can deliver a model that is much more focused on reality.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

Can you clarify, iscanada at the table at Monday's meeting with OPEC or are you dealing with the United States and they are dealing with OPEC?



**Answer**:

We are continuing our conversations with the international community, including OPEC.
There have been communications between OPEC and Canada.
We will continue to stress that we need to work together as a world to get through this economic crisis as well as a health crisis.
We will continue to insist on that.

---

**Question**:

Can you please clarify if that means Canada will actually be at the table.
and also I'd like to get your thoughts on whether Canadian producers should actually been cutting their production further.
They've already had to do this.
More is expected because of supply challenges.
is it wise for Canada to coordinator with a price-settingcartel that we have seen in the oil industry?



**Answer**:

Conversations are ongoing with the United States how we can work together to make sure we are countering some of the measures brought in by OPEC.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] will they be the rangers in northern quÉbec? can you provide more details on that?



**Answer**:

We know that the Canadian rangers are always present in the north to help communities there and to serve.
What I understand is the ranger swill be in inuvik to help them install tents and other medical infrastructure and we'll have more information on numbers in the coming hours.

---

**Question**:

Now, pharmacists are thinking that they may have a shortage of certain critical medicines, such as morphine.
How can you assure that supplies will be there for the hospitals?



**Answer**:

We have a very good pharmaceutical system here.
The companies have been told to produce more material and medicines that we will need during this crisis.
We want to ensure there won't Beau shortage in hospitals.
We will continue to monitor the level of resources available so that no hospital and no Canadians lacking the necessary medication.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

I imagine you have seen the projections from Ontario and quÉbec that will be released shortly.
Can you tell us what your reaction is to those numbers an dhow this will change the federalapproach?



**Answer**:

I'm going to pre-emptthe announcement that premier ford will be making shortly.
We have seen the numbers.
We continue to work very, very closely with the provinces.
We are very much looking to share national projections with Canadians in the coming days.
I can tell you that we know thatthis is a very difficult situation for Canadians.
There are some very challenging projections out there that will emphasize how important it is for all of us to do our part, tostay home, to keep ourselves andour loved ones safe to get through this as best as we possibly can.

---

**Question**:

How do these numbers change the federal approach?



**Answer**:

Our federal approach continues to be to do everything we can based on the scientific advice to keep Canadians safe and to make sure our economy bounces back strongly after this is all through.
The measures that we're encouraging and asking canadiansto take, whether it's around self-isolation or social distancing, which means keeping 2 metres apart, whether it's around ensuring people are washing their hands regularly and for 20 seconds.
These are the things that are going to help keep Canadians safe.
As much as we can do at the federal level.
As much as we can support.
As much as we can bring in quarantines and decrees, ultimately it is Canadians' own behaviour that will make the difference in this.
How we get through this depends on how.
That's why I'm so confident thatwe will get through this becausecanadians are always there for each other.
We're looking to do the right thing.
We will get through this together.
Merci.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking to Canadians for his daily briefing on the fight against COVID-19, both economically and from a public health perspective.
Just an update on the information we are expecting from Ontario today around some of the projections and modelling that they have done.
That press conference has been pushed back to 12:30 eastern.
We will bring it to you live.
We will also now bring you part of the federal government's briefing starting at noon.
Before we do that, let me go to My colleagues Vassy kapelos and Catharine Cullen who have been listening in. It is the content of the answers want you to talk about.
The announcement confirming amazon Canada will be helping the federal government get supplies out to provinces and territories.
and secondly confirming what we had been reporting, the rangers, part of the military, will be going up into northern quÉbec to help out after a request from that province.
Okay.
Let's get to the meatier stuff.
and the food banks.
$100 million.
How quickly I forget.
$100 million for food banks across the country and remote indigenous communities.
a significant amount of money to try to bolster supplies for Canadians who may be using the food banks there.
Vassy, I'll start with you.
There was a lot of stuff in the questions and answers.
Perhaps we'll start with the 33 supply issue.



**Vassy**:

I think that's the biggest headline and story today and probably the biggest concern for the federal government at this moment.
The back story is that 3m which manufacturers n95 masks which are the masks that healthcare professionals need to protect themselves against the virus when they're dealing with those with the virus, the defence production act in the United States, the president has invoked it to make sure that 3m from his perspective only produces those masks and ships them to the United States.
and, in fact, has specified that they not go to Canada anymore.
We don't know the exact details on how many masks we are importing from them or where they're coming from.
My understanding is that none are made.
There is an earlier statement from 3m that we work with found for us that the masks are not produced here in Canada, but they have doubled in the amount of n95 masks brought into canadain the first three months of 2020.
It sounds like this would affect our supply in some sort of significant way.
The Prime Minister was asked, what are you doing about it? are you talking to president trump? what are the conversations like? he said -- he didn't specify that the conversations had been had with president trump, but he did say -- not an explicit threat, but he highlighted a few things about the relationship between the United States and Canada that almost implied a bit of a threat.
I use the word threat not in a specific way.
He said trade goes in both directions.
He highlighted the fact that a thousand nurses in Windsor work in Detroit every day and Americans depend on those nurses.
He said it would be a mistake to limit goods and essential personnel.
and that's what he's pointing out to the American administration.
We don't have any concrete answers of what will come from those conversations or if the United States will pull back, but it sounds like the conversations are being had.
The Prime Minister or others are pointing out the interdependence of the relationship when it comes to essential goods and healthcare workers.



**Rosemary**:

It's so interesting to see the constant strain this relationship seems to be under in the midst of this pandemic, whether the threat from last week bringing the military closer to the Canadian border, which seems now to have died off, to closing the border and finding a way to do that in terms of non-essential travel.
Dealing with an american president who is certainly protectionist and has been even though they managed to sign an agreement on nafta.
I will show a tweet from doug ford who will be speaking shortly, but he has also obviously been concerned with this.
He reached out to the trade representative of the United States, robert leitheiser, I don't know if it will come up.



I've got it right here, Rosie.
He says, I just got off the phone with the ambassador regarding the United States government's new order.
The health and well-being depends on these essential medical items and now more than ever our countries need to work together to combat COVID-19. That message of working togetherwhich is what we heard justin trudeau saying, but the other part of it that Vassy acknowledged, is it a polite threat, an implicit threat, is "threat" the right word.
That's up to the audience to judge.
He said clearly these are thingsamericans rely on. It would be a mistake to create blockages.
It's also important to note thatbecause that would raise concerns.
The Prime Minister did say we continue to receive what we need.
He pointed to the language in the 3m release which essentiallysuggests that 3m is pushing backsomewhat.
That release says that 3m is being required to prioritize american needs.
To what point that has to be done to the absolute exclusion of other countries is the crucial question I think in all of this.
You point out that they have been negotiating for the americans for some people even recently over the course of thispandemic.
You've seen that tweet from dougford.
I was following up on that storyabout troops at the border and Chrystia Freeland was having conversations and bill blair, harjit sajjan.
We can be certain that those conversations are ongoing.
I think the Prime Minister referenced that these discussions had been going on for a few days and the question is the outcome.



**Rosemary**:

The 3m statement itself was fairly explicit in what the Prime Minister for all sorts of political reasons couldn't say, and that is 3m saying if they were to do this, it would cause other countries to retaliate.
3m able to say things more clearly than the Prime Minister who is doing a delicate dance.
I will go back to the issue of modelling because we are going to get to that shortly in Ontario.
They are posted more information just I think yesterday, end of day.
I try to look every day, but it seems yesterday there's been an update to the federal government's reporting on data, which is fairly comprehensive.
But still I guess there is a desire to get more and the Prime Minister saying they are committed to doing that, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, the difference between the data we have available to us now and what the ask is, basically we have the raw data, you're absolutely right, on the public health website.
You can find out, for example, how many cases, how many hospitalizations, it's broken down by demographic.
What we don't have is any projection, with the caveat that those projections are not a crystal ball, as many doctors have outlined, but a gauge for Canadians who are extremely anxious about the potential for how long or basically wondering how long this is going to go on. There's no way to know for certain.
It's going to be impacted by ourbehaviours.
But there are a range of scenarios that various governments are dealing with.
That range we are expecting to hear from the premier of Ontario.
Other premiers have promised to release that data as well.
Much of it has been released in Alberta and British Columbia the ask of the federal government is to provide the same at the national level, again with another caveat that it not just depends on our behaviours, but they have to assimilate and analyze the data.
Some provinces don't even have enough data to produce to analyze.
They likely will next week, but at this point they don't. The Prime Minister would not pita timeline on the release of that data.
He echoed his understanding that he spoke of yesterday, that Canadians want the analysis, they want to see the various models before the federal government, but more of the same in the promising.
It will come but no timeline attached to that.
He has seen the numbers from Ontario and seen the data that we're to hear from premier ford in about 40 minutes, but he didn't want to pre-empt the premier before the release.



**Rosemary**:

We're not all scientists, but there is a fairly good graph there on the federal website, the public health website, that gives you the way Canada is comparing to other countries.
What no one has done is essentially what the president of the United States did, which is if we don't do this, this many people will die.
No one has done that in this country.
It sounds like Ontario might do some of that today, based on some of what mike crawly has been reporting.
I want to get to a doctor before let you go -- you're not going to go, but stay here.
Let's put these questions to Dr. Russ up shire who will help us understand things more for people who aren't scientists.
What I guess we are expecting from Ontario is some sort of projection of how bad things could get, and that could include hospitalizations, I. C.u., and potentially deaths.
is that what your understanding is from what we might expect?



**Interview**:

Yeah, I'm not entirely sure what to expect because I haven't seen the results of the models and data.
Meanwhile, good afternoon.
It's nice to hear your voice and hope you're well and safe.



**Rosemary**:

I am. and I appreciate that and the same for you.
What are the limitations of these kinds of projections and modelling.
I point to the example in the United States which was done for largely political reasons, to befrank, but what are the advantages and disadvantages in this information?



**Interview**:

So I like what you said earlier that many of us are not scientists.
This is an opportunity while on lock down to increase our sources of science.
The big question is what is a model? models are mathematical representations that are used to actually help us gain understanding of the complex world that we live in. So there's a famous statistician that said that all models are wrong or lie, but some lie more usefully than others.
Models are critically dependant on the data that we have in order to make them work.
Some models are purely explanatory.
They just describe things.
Some things are projections, so they're forecasting.
We all know about forecasting models because we watch the weather and we follow the economy.
What we're going to find is that models give us a range of possible scenarios of what may or may not happen in the near future.
Two things to remember.
Models are only as good as the data that informs us. If we're not happy with the data that we have, we need to ask ourselves questions about why wehaven't supported public health in the way that we need to and fund it so that we have surveillance systems and systems of data that are actually able to be integrated and analyzed Ina timely fashion.
We can come back to that later.
Secondly, the models will give us some near-term projections, perhaps, may they tell us thingsthat have happened already.
We're always working with laggeddata.
In other words, what we're seeing in the data today reflects what happened a couple of weeks ago, which means we have to be extremely cautious oftheir interpretation, mindful oftheir limitations.
We most importantly need not getfixated on a particular time or date or number because all models are equally provisional, they hold for the time the data support their veracity.
They need to be updated in termsof new information that comes in. We're learning a lot from other jurisdictions.
That information -- the really important important thing is there's been huge amount of information sharing globally.
Clinicians and global health professionals are learning from the experiences of colleagues innew york, italy, china.
Everyone is as quickly as possible trying to get their heads and minds around this evolving difficult situation.



**Rosemary**:

That's a super great explanation.
Thank you for that.
What is the benefit to the public of seeing not just models, but projections? because I don't think we have seen strict projections on things like the mortality rate.
We've seen what it's at now.
In terms of if we continue down this road, this will happen.
What will be the benefit to the public in knowing that?



**Interview**:

There are certain things that flow directly from seeing projections.
One is that we have very few medical counter measures at our disposal right now.
Our best weapon, so to speak, though I don't like to use that language, our best response to the challenges posed by coronavirus is to do exactly what the Prime Minister was saying before he concluded his briefing.
We need to stay resolved for social distancing, for physical distancing, for the measures that are in place.
I know it's imposing sacrifices on absolutely everyone.
Until we have better ideas of how much is going on in the community and we have better ideas from the people who are understanding the impact through, perhaps, the use of serological tests and other measures, we're going to have to use what is at our disposal, which is ourself.
We're all reliant on each other and our own behaviour to bring this under control.



**Rosemary**:

I only have a minute, doctor.
I wish I had more time.
You did work in public health during the SARS outbreak.



**Interview**:

Yes.



**Rosemary**:

How important was the data, modelling, and the projections in terms of shaping the response at that time? I know we've learned a lot of lessons since then.



**Interview**:

SARS taught us -- you might recall those of us working in the public health side of things doing the epidemiology were trying to work with stickier notes.
The first lesson from SARS was that we needed to invest in a public health infrastructure to have data systems that provide us with real-time information sowe can make good decisions and that's still good today.



**Rosemary**:

Doctor, I've got to leave it there.
I do appreciate it. I hope you're going to come back.
That's Dr. Russ upshur.
Thanks, doctor.
We are standing by to bring you that update from Toronto at 12:30 eastern, but we will also bring you on CBC news network and CBC News.
Ca the latest from the cabinet ministers and the public health officials.
I'm rosemary Barton.
[♪♪♪]



**Rosemary**:

I'm rosemary Barton.
Welcome once again where you might be joining us on CBC news network or streaming on CBC News.
Ca and on our app.
We heard from the prime minister moments ago that me is working with the provinces to release the most up-to-date and accurateinformation on the data and the analysis of data in COVID-19. We are expecting, though, today from Ontario to release some newnumbers, some new projections, if you will, this hour.
These are projections that the premier, doug ford, say are stark.
There is a hope that they could serve as a wake-up call about the spread of COVID-19, given itwill get into hospitalizations and potential fatalities or fatalities that have been prevented because of some of themeasures that have been put in place over the last number of weeks.
The Prime Minister also made an announcement around food banks, $100 million going to show up food banks to protect food security for Canada's most vulnerable in this country, whether in urban areas or more remote or indigenous communities.
The Prime Minister was also asked about a developing story around 3m and reports that the United States is trying to restrict where that company can send masks and equipment.
Justin trudeau says that would be a mistake.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We've been working very closely with the Americans to highlight what Canadians know very, very well, that the level of integration between our economies goes both ways across the border, that we are receiving essential supplies from the United States, but the United States also receives essential supplies and products and, indeed, healthcare professionals from Canada every single day.
I think of the thousands of nurses, for example, who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every single day.
These are things that Americans rely on. It would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back and forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.
That is the point we're making very clearly to the American administration right now.



**Rosemary**:

As we wait for federal cabinet ministers and public health officials to come in and give a briefing, as we wait for Toronto to give their briefing at 12:30, let's go back to My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and Catharine Cullen.
In the midst of these extraordinary times, extraordinary measures being taken on all sorts of fronts.
and still the same challenging relationship with the United States.
It does seem we've been able to walk them back through this pandemic or get them to where Canada wants them to be. But here we are in this situation, Vassy, at a time you hope the world is working in a more co-operative and collaborative way.
Obviously that's not always the case.



**Vassy**:

No, it's not always the case with be and it feels like DEA vu, where you pointed out last week that we were talking about the threat from the United States to militarize the border between Canada and the United States it's the longest demilitarized border in the world.
That was another issue they had to deal with, the federal government had to deal with, in the middle of trying to respond to the crisis that was unfolding.
They had to deal with the possibility of the border being armed.
Fast-forward a week, and now thepresident of the United States wants to use a war time act to conjure up capacity to supply american needs.
In this case, those needs are shared by canadian first responders as well as healthcareprofessionals, those n95 masks, so central to their ability to not themselves get infected whenthey are treating the Canadians and americans south of the border, who have been infected by this virus.
The idea is behind the legislative measure the president is trying to use, to direct that production to the United States.
3m, the maker of those masks, has come out saying, well, it won't exactly work that way.
There are humanitarian concerns if we cut off the supply to Canada and latin american countries.
What we are not clear on is how much of Canada's supply would beimpacted by the cutting off of those n95 masks.
How will this play out.
Does 3m have the ability to fight back against the legislative leverage the president is trying to use.
I'm unclear on the answer to that.
The Prime Minister was asked multiple times about this and hevery much continued to point out -- it's funnily talking about deja vu. Wu keep hearing similar lines from the federal government, andthat is an emphasis on the interdependence from both of ourcountries.
The economy is in overlap, but also in this case essential workers.
There are a thousand nurses in windsor who work in detroit.
The Prime Minister highlighted that and tried to underline, saying americans depend on them.
It would be a mistake to limit access to goods and personnel.
Sometimes the stuff the federal government points out works.
It's unclear at this point whether that will be the outcomein this incident.



**Rosemary**:

It's challenging to read the president who is under an intense amount of political pressure himself during an election year trying to manage this and convince Americans that maybe it isn't as bad as it appears it is. If he's having to sort of pull out all the stops to protect hi sown citizens, it's very challenging to see how we respond to that.
Catharine.



I would like a distinction between what was happening last week and this week.
Obviously we have to look at the relationship with the United States over the course of Donald trump's presidency and are there have been many incidents.
Last week when Donald trump was asked about this request as a suggestion that a thousand soldiers might be brought to thecanada-United States border, he seemed to be caught publicly unaware.
He suggested there were troops at the border, which is not the case.
As Vassy said, it's the longest undefended border in the world.
There was a sense from what we saw publicly was that he didn't necessarily have a stake in thatissue.
We saw a document put out that this is something that homeland security and border services wasinterested in, not that donald trump was invested in. We have a lot of questions how all this is going to work, but if this is something donald trump believes is in the United States' best interest, itbecomes that much more complicated to try to sway him to Canada's point of view.
We got a bit of a sense about how that might work from the Prime Minister.
It will be interesting to hear from Chrystia Freeland, the deputy Prime Minister.
We can see that doug ford has already been enlisted or decidedto act.
I suppose we don't know.
He's been speaking with the ambassador trying to persuade the americans.
This will be a full court press.



**Rosemary**:

This tendency towards nationalism, for lack of better word, in some ways makes sense.
From our perspective, we are trying to create domestic supply lines and switch industries over from one thing to producing medical equipment.
What is different in this case is the restrictions the United States is trying to place on a private company to do its business outside of the country at a time when that would be a critical supply chain, Vassy.
But you can kind of see why countries are moving in this direction.
You heard Doug ford say it too, he plans to do everything he can so we don't run into this.
So we are, as Catharine's been talking about, out in the world trying to bargain for pieces of equipment.



**Vassy**:

We heard that from the prime Minister over the last few days and Minister navdeep Bains, the whole idea behind their efforts to retool industry in this country to make it that we are not as dependant on supply and manufacturing from other countries.
The difference is they haven't said we're going to cut off sending things to other places.
However, if we step back from our own interests and Canada's interests, it does make sense on the surface, the messaging around the protectionist message that the president is espousing now.
It makes sense, but it's also worked politically for him in the past.
The america-first message is onethat resonated particularly in parts of the country that we know very well, in the midwest, for example.
and the message right now if people in the United States are concerned about their healthcareprofessionals or themselves being able to access the supplies and equipment they need, I don't think he's going to get a huge fight from within the country's borders.
Obviously the distinction is, we've said the same thing.
Shore up domestic supply, not cut off the supplies to other countries or people, especially to next door who might need them.



**Rosemary**:

We heard out of that call yesterday between the Prime Minister and the premiers, the premiers have all agreed if something happens, if there is as urge in one part of the country and they need supplies, everyone will come together and make thathappen.
I realize that's in our own borders, but that sort of collaboration you would hope to see in other parts of the world as well.
It's part of the reason why Canada sent equipment to china in early days, in a bid to contain the global pandemic.
I should point out on the equipment, though, that we did get that update that really millions of masks have arrived this week.
There was 10 million earlier in the week, a million in Hamilton.
There were donations of some masks that have been verified and will be sent out to the places they're needed.
We've talked a lot in our own news meetings what hospital officials called the burn rate.
That is the idea that they are going through I didn't mean to allot faster than they have before.
I'm not going to let you talk, I'm sorry.
The ministers are arriving.
You can start when we are done.
We are going to take part of the federal press conference and when the Ontario briefing begins around 12:30 eastern, we will go to that live because our colleague has done some reporting that the measures in place have presented many more cases of COVID-19 and deaths, but that will have to continue in a stricter way.
Here is the deputy Prime Minister of Canada.



[voice of interpreter] thank you for being with us today.
[end of translation] Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
We all need to stray strong and stay at home.
I would like to say something this morning to our elders.
Our aunts and uncles, our mothers and fathers, our grandparents.
I've been thinking about you a lot.
You raised us. You've built our amazingcountry.
Now you are staying inside and you are physically separated from your loved ones.
I know this is really hard and want you to know that we love you very much.
We are doing everything in our power to keep you safe.
When My children find the physical distancing hard, I remind them that they are doing it for themselves, for the wholecountry, and also for the elders in our family they love very much.
 [voice of interpreter] Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
Stay strong and stay home.
This morning I want to talk to our elders, seniors, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, an dour grandparents.
You have raised us. You've built our wonderful country.
Now you are inside and physically separated from your loved ones.
This is very difficult.
We want you to know that we loveyou.
We are doing and will continue to do everything in our power to protect you.
[end of translation] so today we will hear from our Minister of health, patty hajdu.
Then we will hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa tam.
Then we will hear via video conference the agri-food Minister.
and then after that the president of the treasury board jean-yves Duclos.
[end of translation] and Dr. Njoo.



Let me first start by sending our deepest condolences to the families who lost their loved once due to COVID-19. Our hearts are with you during this difficult time.
We continue to work with you through all levels of government to defeat this virus.
We will come out stronger together.
Please don't forget to download the Canada COVID-19 app.
We've had 123, 000 downloads over the last few days.
This is a useful tool and it will give you updated and accurate information about Canada's fight against COVID-19. It provides accurate and detailed data about what is happening across the country.
It will provide you the ability to check your symptoms if you feel that you are unwell or unsure.
With that, I'll turn to Dr. Tam.



Hello, Bonjour.
I will start with the update on our cases in Canada.
There are now 11, 747 cases of COVID-19, including 152 deaths.
Again, this represents infections from previous exposures and not what is happening right now.
So again, our urge is that even if you're not hearing about cases in your community, it doesn't mean that there is no risk of exposure.
We must all consider that anyone could be infected and keep our 2-metre distance as the safest approach.
We continue to test at a high rate in Canada, with tests completed for over 290, 000 people in Canada.
Around 4% confirmed as positive and 95% confirmed as negative.
Maintaining our testing around this 3% to 4% positivity will keep us in a good range to accurately detect where the disease is circulating.
We are, however, continuing to increase our laboratory capacity to make sure we maintain this level of tracking COVID-19 activity across the country.
This is a frustrating time as we continue with strict public health measures, while waiting for signs of improvement.
So far, thanks to all the efforts of Canadians, the health system in Canada is coping and we need to keep it this way.
There are areas where the virus has been the most active, like Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, but these areas are managing too.
 [voice of interpreter] as you are aware, COVID-19 can cause severe illness, but the disease course can take several weeks.
Hence, severe outcome including death, will not be occurring in high numbers in the early weeks.
But as the outbreak progresses, fatalities will continue to accrue.
This could explain why we are seeing a sharp rise in deaths reported in recent days.
This is a sad reminder to us all that we must take this disease seriously.
We can draw hope from the fact the countries particularly hard hit, like Italy, are now showing signs that the epidemic may havepeaked.

We are here to learn about the lessons learned and perspectives of all of these countries, as we adapt our responses.
Our knowledge and science under goes evolution over time.
This is a pandemic that has not been with us for very long, and public health colleagues, experts across the country, are now continuing to learn and adapt our knowledge as these become available in real time.
So of course we owe it to everyone to not put another Canadian at risk and to do all we can to stop the spread of COVID-19 right now.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam.
 [voice of interpreter] and now I'll give the floor to the Minister of agriculture, marie-claude bibeau.
Please go ahead.



Thank you.
As Minister of agriculture and agri-food, My main concern at this moment is to ensure that everyone has access to a varietyof healthy nutritious food.
Aws of COVID-19, food banks and other community organizations can no longer meet the demand.
They have lost many volunteers, often seniors.
They have to reorganize their facilities to prevent inter-personal contact.
Some clients are isolated and they have to provide home delivery.
There are multiple challenges.
That's why today Prime Minister justin trudeau announced $100 million to support food banks and local organizations on the frontlines.
There are five large food delivery networks that can meet the needs of the various clientsacross the country.
Food banks Canada will receive $50 million, while second harvest, community food centres Canada, breakfast club, and the salvation army will share $20 million.
Each food bank from each region in Canada should be able to veryquickly connect, directly or indirectly, to one of these fivemain networks.
For example, in quÉbec the moison network is a member of food banks Canada.
The rest of the $30 million willbe provided later, where we willhave identified gaps.
[end of translation] access healthy food is something we allcare about.
COVID-19 is increasing the number of Canadians who struggleto access food and is having a major impact on the operations of local food organizations.
Food banks of all kinds are being forced to adapt.
To find younger volunteers, to minimize interpersonal contact, to offer home delivery.
The challenges are great.
Today Prime Minister trudeau announced that $100 million in support of our organizations whoare on the frontlines, making sure people get essential food support in their time of need.
Food banks Canada will receive $50 million, while $20 million has been evenly divided between second harvest, community food centres Canada, the breakfast club of Canada, and the salvation army.
These organizations will work with local partners to meet urgent and increased food needs, including those in indigenous and northern populations.
The last $30 million will be allocated later to fill the gapsand respond to further needs.
I invite all My M.P. colleagues across the country to reach out to their local food banks to make sure they are connected to one of the five partners.
I want to take this opportunity to also announce that through the food policy for Canada -- through the local food infrastructure fund, as of today, 362 projects across the nation have received funding fora total of $6.6 million.
 [voice of interpreter] as part of the local food infrastructure fund which is part of the food policyfor Canada, I am proud to announce 362 projects have received up to $6.6 million.
[end of translation] all parts of those in the food chain are stepping up during this extraordinary time.
I invite those who can, to please consider supporting your local food bank or community organization.
Farmers, those working in food processing plants, truckers, clerks in grocery stores, and obviously volunteers in food banks are all proud members of acritical infrastructure, the food supply chain.
If you're healthy and available, consider joining them.
 [voice of interpreter] I would like to thank our essential workers who have been showing up on our farms, grocery stores, on the roads throughout the country.
Yesterday the list of essential services has been made public and it comes as to surprise thatthe entire food supply chain wason that list.
Take care of yourselves and yourfamily.
If you're healthy and available, consider providing your servicesto the sector.



Thank you.
I'll give the floor to the president of the treasury board, jean-yves Duclos.
Please go ahead.



Today the Prime Minister's message is one of helping each other out.
The first important one we just heard from Minister bibeau, the $100 million for food banks across the country, in particular the salvation army and other particularly active organizations.
The second message the g. S.t. Tax credit is being provided sooner, in April.
That's on average $400 with -- for one-person families and $600more for two people -- families of two people or more.
It's also a message of helping others out through the involvement of the rangers for the canadian armed forces in thenorthern and remote regions of quÉbec.
We know they will play an important role to help protect these communities that are oftenvery vulnerable.
This is a message of standing together so we can keep hope, keep taking care of each other to get through this crisis.



Thank you, jean-yves.
Now we are ready to take your questions.
[end of translation].



We have three questions on the phone, one question and one follow-up. Operator.
