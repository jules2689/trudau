**Rosemary**:

Okay.
We're going to pull away from the federal briefing.
Many questions about the 3m masks shipment from the United States.
Ontario is going to give a better sense of the numbers and what they could look like now and to the other side.



From the university of Toronto.
All right.
I'll let them deliver their remarks.



Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll deliver some remarks and then we'll be happy to take yourquestions.
The information in our presentation today was developed by several experts in public health Ontario and researchers at Ontario universities.
All of this led by the COVID-19 command table.
Our objective today is to share the modelling and projection table that command table has been using to inform our work and has been using to advise government on their response to COVID-19. We feel it's important to be transparent with the public about the scale of the challenges which together we are facing and the important work that we all need to do to help flatten the curve.
How this outbreak unfolds is in the hands of the public, in effect, in all of our hands.
We can change the outcome for the province by staying at home and physically distancing ourselves from each other.
Now, recognizing that we get new information about this virus and this outbreak on a daily basis, we will of course continue to refine our projections, our models, and our advice.
Everybody should take reassurance from the fact that our public health measures so far have made a significant difference.
We need everyone to stay focused in the weeks ahead.
So stay home, stop the spread, and stay safe.
For media following along with the slides, I'm now turning to slide 4. There have been 67 deaths in Ontario.
I appreciate that some people may see different figures from that, but those are the figures that have been processed through the integrated public health information system.
Although I can fully understand it may appear confusing or frustrating for some members of the press, when they hear about deaths reported in the media locally, it must be frustrating when the death count does not quite tally.
But it is important that you understand that the correct way to track this over time is through the integrated public health information system, iphis.
There will be a little lag as hard-pressed public health unitsinsert the necessary details.
The thing that is striking from the data that we thus far have in Ontario is the high mortalityrate in those over the age of 80. Thus far, it is 16%. that is actually a little less than global experience, where the evidence from around the world suggests that the mortality in those over the age of 80 is actually 20%. the mortality in those over the age of 70 globally is also significant, at around 10%. these are very important figuresfor us all to be familiar with, because it tells us we must focus on protecting the elderly.
On the next slide for the media who are following along, you will see COVID-19 cases in Ontario tracked against those in other countries and other jurisdictions.
The thing that I must draw your attention to is the fact there is a algorithmic scale along theleft side of this graph.
and of course what that means isthat a small increase in the graph equates with a very large number increases in cases.
Nevertheless, in an epidemic situation, this is usually the most useful way to track the progress of a disease.
As you can see from this curve, we are following a trajectory somewhat similar to that in the United States, not quite as goodcurrently as that in British Columbia.
But I would hasten to say that when one tracks cases, it reallyis rather difficult to know exactly where you stand.
You have to watch it extremely carefully because it is rather dependant upon who you test for the disease.
If I turn to the next slide, we are tracking deaths.
Now, sadly, deaths around the world are mounting.
One of the things about trackingdeaths, as opposed to tracking cases, they are not subject to the same complications that are brought about by differences in testing strategies.
So here again you can see that we appear in Ontario to be roughly in line with the rest ofcanada and to be roughly in linewith the United States.
But of course, once again, we will continue to watch this extremely carefully.
It is important to acknowledge at this point that a great deal has already been done in this province that will help limit the eventual death toll from COVID-19. If, for example, we go back as far as March 12, we had the closure of public schools.
Rapidly after there had been a series of other measures.
For example, limiting visitations to long-term care, limiting those who are in short-term in-and-out arrangements with correctional facilities with -- and limiting gatherings to 250.
My March 15, people were being told to practice social distancing and travellers from outside Canada were told to self-isolate for 14 days.
The prohibitions on gatherings was dropped to 50. People were told to work virtually wherever possible.
By March 17, we had the closure of public gathering places and establishment by March 21. Redeployment for healthcare professionals.
Then rapidly in success on the 23, 24, and 25 of March, the closure of non-essential workplaces, work deployment for l. T.c. Homes, and the prohibition of gatherings of more than groups of five people.
Most recently we have seen enhanced capacity for contact tracing being rapidly put in place.
We have seen the closure of parks and outdoor recreational facilities and people have been instructed to limit outings to essential needs.
Self-isolation for individuals over 70 and those who have underlying medical conditions orwho are immunocompromised has been very strongly recommended.
We also have had extended schoolclosures.
I'm now going to pass across to stenie brown.



Thank you.
I want to just start on slide 9 for those who are following on with slides and talk a little bit about some of the caution with which any models need to beinterpreted.
This is to help us plan what could happen.
I say this with very great seriousness, they are an abstraction of what we're dealing with and the farther out we go, the more uncertainty there is. We've used assumptions based from other outbreaks of COVID-19and what we can gather from dataaround Canada to inform the model.
Then we model how it spreads.
We do this on standard epidemiological models and try to make estimates about how quickly and widely the disease will spread.
It's critical to say we will talk about what would have happened had we done nothing.
We will talk about what may happen now given the public health interventions in place.
We'll also talk about what wouldhappen if we had enhanced measures to try to suppress the disease as far as we can.
It's important to note that these measures only work if people follow them.
The assumptions in place here are assumptions about people working to make sure they stay safe and keep the people around them safe.
It's important if there are people with COVID-19 moving between healthcare facilities orother places where there's many people living at the same time, there could be larger outbreaks.
Going along to the next slide, which is slide 10, you will see the curves that look at the different countries that Dr. Donnelly has already talked to. I just want to lay out that the Ontario curve is shorter becauseof a shorter experience with thedisease, but that point way on the far point there of significant number of deaths, almost 100, 000 deaths, is an estimate of what we would be looking at in 30 days had we nottaken the initial measures.
I talk about what things would be like if we did not take the initial measures.
It's important to present the seriousness of the threat of COVID-19. and also the issue if we were torelax or assume we are in safe territory now, this is a diseasethat can rear back very quickly.
You can see here 100, 000 cases within 30 days had we not done anything.
If you go to slide 11, you'll see a little more clear representation of this.
The 300, 000 cases with a lot of growth right there.
The current intervention, what we mean there in the middle, is that there is a substantial reduction given your public health interventions in place, but still 80, 000 cases we might see if the disease continues to grow, as it does in other jurisdictions.
Looking at cases here, 12, 500 roughly cases we would expect by the end of the month if we take new, enhanced measures to suppress the disease.
If you go on to slide 12, you'llsee a similar presentation of deaths here.
Had we taken no action, again, even in the short 30-day period between here and now, you would be looking at up to 6, 000 deaths.
Thankfully there have been some actions taken.
This leads us to a current estimate of 1, 600 deaths.
a substantial reduction in the number of deaths over the month of April.
Were we to put in -- I misspoke.
1, 600 deaths that would have occurred from cases that developed during the month of April.
But were we to take strong, strong action now, the number ofdeaths that we would be looking at from cases that developed during the month of April would be much lower, at around 250 in the future intervention.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dr. Donnelly.



Thank you, steinn.
As Stein has correctly pointed out, projections and modelling of a brand new viral disease are very inexact.
But what is important is that we use them early and quickly to advise us as to the correct measures to take.
and that is what has happened inontario.
I want to turn now to perhaps what might be the most disturbing slide in this deck for those who have the deck to hand.
That is the slide which is on page 13. I think it's important that we all are robustly realistic about the scale of the challenge that we face.
and what this slide shows is the projection by public health Ontario, which is in line with that of other highly credible modelers that says that over the full course of this pandemic, which may last for 18 months or even two years because we may have a smaller secondary or tertiary wave, over the full two-year course of the pandemic, had we done nothing, Ontario mayhave suffered 100, 000 deaths.
Thankfully, that is not the position that we are in. Because of the very detailed actions that I read out to you before which have been taken in response to emerging science, webelieve that if we do all that we can, we can get a much betterend result for the province.
It is not possible to be exact about where we will end up, but I think it is reasonable to say that if we do everything that we can think of, everything that already has been done stays in place, all of the other measureswhich are being considered put in place, that I think we could reduce the death toll in ontarioto somewhere between 3, 000 and 15, 000.
There is a range because where we end up depends on all of us. If we follow the rules, if we doour best to socially distance, if we look after the elderly andthe vulnerable in our society, we can get within that range andwe can strive to get as low as possible within that range.
So I appreciate that to many people these will be shocking figures, but the important thingto stress again is that effective actions have been put in place, remain in place, and further actions are being proposed and are being taken.
Now, we need to turn at this point to the important issue of all of the preparedness work which has been going on within Ontario health services.
So I'm going to turn to matt anderson from Ontario health.



Thank you, Dr. Donnelly.
Good afternoon, everyone.
For those who are following with the slides, I have one slide, and this is the slide on I. C.u. Capacity in Ontario.
We use this slide, as I think weall know, there are many different components to our health system.
It is a very big system.
This is a bellweather measure for us, as we think about how dowe get a sense of our preparedness and readiness for this pandemic within our healthcare system.
So the I. C.u. Capacity is a goodmeasure for us. If you don't have this slide, what this describes is two curves, much like you saw from Dr. Donnelly and Dr. Brown.
This is a slightly different dataset because we sup date thisevery day, tomorrow's numbers will be different than today's. We do look at do we have the capacity in our system to be able to support the people who are going to need our wonderful healthcare system? right now and what you would seeif you save the slide is there are two lines on there.
One is the amount of capacity wehave in our system today.
The other is the amount of capacity we can surge to today.
We continue to try to move that second line up. We want to get as much capacity in our healthcare system as we can develop in a very short timeperiod that we're discussing.
There are two bar charts, however, on this slide that are most telling.
The first one which is in blue shows that is our best-case scenario, given the data that wehave at the moment, given the projections you've just heard from Dr. Donnelly and Dr. Brown.
What's core is that line brushesup to what we're able to expand our healthcare system today as it relates to critical capacity.
The other bar chart is what happens if we do not adhere to our social distancing.
If we start down the paths that you've heard described by Dr. Donnelly and Dr. Brown in not containing this disease and this disease growing more rapidly.
What you can see from the slidesis fairly soon in the April to early may time frame, it will push beyond the capacity that we can bring.
I would say on both I. C.u. Capacity and on the entire system, your healthcare system, all of our wonderful people who work in it, we are trying everything we can to increase the capacity that we have to respond to this disease.
However, as you've already heard, we need everyone to play their part.
We have to try to keep the prevalence of this disease to a minimum to allow our healthcare system to be able to support those who need it. Thank you.



Matt, thank you.
Just two more slides from me and then we'll pause and take your questions.
So people ask how one slows the spread.
I need to introduce you to what sounds like a complicated concept but really is not.
It's the so-called reproductive number or the effective reproductive number of this virus.
It's actually a lot simpler thanit sounds, but it's worth thinking about because I think it helps us all understand what we should do. So if I was sitting here with COVID-19 and I managed to give it to My two colleagues, that wouldmean that I had contributed to areproductive number of two.
If they then gave it to two colleagues again, you can very quickly see how the disease continues to grow at pace.
If, on the other hand, My two colleagues both had COVID-19, but through proper social distancingand proper hand hygiene, et cetera, they managed one of them to give it to nobody and one to give it just to me, you can see that the reproductive number then is less than 1, it's0.5. Of course what happens then is that the disease begins to peterout.
It's about breaking the chain ofinfection.
It's very important that every one of us realize that we have apersonal responsibility and a personal opportunity to do that.
So we need people to stay home, to stay focused, to stop the spread, and to stay safe.
Everybody needs to fully adhere to the public health measures that are put in place, because we want to avoid overwhelming the health service in the way that matt has just described andthe way that, tragically, you will see reported on the news media from around the world.
So bearing down heavily on this disease now saves lives, allows our health system to cope, and also helps the economy.
This is not widely recognized but is important.
There is convincing research that suggests that if you bear down hard at this point, it actually brings the disease to an end more quickly and it allows the economy to bounce back.
So there is no dilemma between saving lives and saving the economy.
Bearing down hard now achieves both things.
Finally, I need to run through anumber of immediate focused additional public health measures and also future measures which are coming.
So the first thing that is very much being worked on as we speakis enhanced capacity for case and contact tracing.
In jurisdictions elsewhere in the world that have done particularly well, this has beenvery important.
It's about breaking the chain byassertively chasing down cases and their contacts.
There is a small army of federalemployees, medical students, andothers being assembled to actually address this issue.
They will be working closely with public health Ontario, withthe ministry of health, with Ontario health, but particularlywith the public health units in the province.
The second thing is increased testing due to very impressive efforts by frontline lab staff and lab leadership, not just at public health Ontario, but across the province in many of our hospitals.
We have now eliminated the backlog of tests.
That is important, because that now allows us to use tests in a very focused and strategic way.
For example, testing residents of long-term care homes and their carers needs to be a priority.
As we have tragically seen, if you get even one case in a long-term care home, it is very easy for it to spread very quickly and to bring about many deaths.
[ please stand by ]-- those who would cry simplyshut everything down and need toremember that we need our nursesand doctors and health careworkers to get to work.
We need our laboratory workersto get to the labs.
and we need transport to operateto get people there.
The public need to be able to get groceries, pharmacy suppliesand other essentials of life.
So reducing the number and typesof essential workplaces issomething that needs to be donecarefully and thoughtfully.
There will be an enhanszed focuson enforcement and fines fornon-compliance.
Physical distancing guidelineswill be further enhanced, particularly with regard toretail settings.
It is essential that we provideenhanced support for theelderly, for the homeless, forvulnerable populations and forcommunities.
The concept of a ring of steelaround long-term care homes isimportant.
I applaud those jurisdictionswho have proactively moved tohouse the homeless inaccommodation which may provelife saving.
Many first nations communitiesare looking very carefully aboutovercrowding and housing and, again, I welcome the approachthat some public health unitshave taken in working with firstnations to reduce overcrowdingand, therefore, to reducevulnerability.
Some first nations are lookingat entry restrictions to theirterritory.
Human resource management isgoing to continue to beimportant.
We have to protect our healthcare workers.
We have to allow them to lookafter us. We're exploring rapidly the useof technology to reinforceself-isolation, including, forexample, alerts.
and additional public educationand communication will beforthcoming.
Once again in summary, and theni will stop for your questionsto any of the three of us, we need to bear down heavily onthis disease now because it willsave lives.
It will allow our health caresystem to cope, and ultimatelyit will be the best way to helpour economy bounce back.
I'm happy at that point to pauseand we will do our best toanswer any questions that youmight have.



Okay, so just a reminder for everyone on the lines.
The premier's press conference is pushed back to 2:00 p. M. now and we're going to take questions to 1:45. I'm going to remind the speakers before you answer a question, please just say your name.
and now we're going to open up the lines for the first caller.



Your first question comes from mike crawly with CBC news.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi. My question is for Dr. Donnelly.
Dr. Donnelly, I've heard from lots of different sources that the reason that these projections were not made earlier is because the data coming from Ontario has been incredibly slow and because of all of the delays in the testing and the delays in getting test results out there.
How do you respond to public health Ontario's own responsibility in the shortcomings of Ontario'stesting regime and the shortcomings of Ontario'stransparency with this data?



Mike, it's not true that the projections in terms of mortality were wrong.
The projections in terms of mortality are not dependent on testing data in the firstinstance.
It is entirely possible -- and this is what we did -- to make projections in terms of mortality based on the global experience thus far of COVID-19. and so the presentation to the command of what was at that time the best estimates of worst-casescenario more tar that willitywhich at that time was 91, 000.
I know that you understand thatthis is not an exact science.
But we predicted right back atthe beginning of March that themortality could be that highbased on global experiences andpresenting to command in thatway led to the immediatedecision to bring about schoolclosures.
and beyond that I havearticulated all of the variousmeasures that have been taken.
These have all been taken inresponse to an assessment ofwhere the province was.
Public health Ontario has a rolein this situation ofcommunicating science right intothe heart of the decisionmakingprocess.
and it is important foreverybody to understand thatpublic health Ontario has donethat fearlessly, will continueto do that fearlessly, andwhat's more, that is what ourpolitical leaders want.
I have personally briefed thepremier and the health Minister.
They listened respectfully.
They were very thoughtful.
They are utterly committed togetting this right.
I personally sit on both thecommand table and the executivecommand table and so I have adirect access on a daily basisto the three co-chairs of thatcommand table.
Helen angus, the deputy ministerand matt andersen, who issitting on My right, the head ofontario health, and Dr. Davidwilliams, the chief medicalofficer.
So science has been to thefore in informing the responseof the command table during thisepidemic.



Okay, we'll just take a very brief follow-up.

---

**Question**:

Okay.
I didn't hear an answer responding to the question about the delays in testing.
and My understanding is that the data was not actually provided to the people doing themodeling, the epidemiologists doing the modeling, until late last night.
So if you could please respond directly to those two specific things -- the delays in testing, and the delivery of the data that the epidemiologists needed to do all of this modeling.



Sure, happy to do so. The release of data is a thing that only the ministry can do. The ministry has decided to release data to anybody who wishes to model this disease.
I think that's a very sensiblething.
Modeling as you move through this epidemic will become increasingly complicated.
and we will need to draw on the very best brains, so I think that it's very wise that all of the data is being madeavailable.
But once again the early projections of mortality weremade, were provided right into the heart of this process, and so they determined the policyresponse.
Your second point about testing is also important.
Public health Ontario as regional reference lab hasramped up its testing capacityconsiderably.
But this is an unprecedented situation where we have required everyone to become involved.
and there is now a very strongcross-provincial approach whichmeans that the testing capacityin the province is greatlyenhanced.
As I said, that means that thebacklog has now been eliminated.
It is true that there werechallenges earlier on withtesting related to a globalshortage of some of the keyre-agents.
That is something that needed to be overcome with herculeanefforts by many in the system.
I think that it very hearteningto see how all of the system haspulled together, has secured thenecessary materials to do thistesting.
and it's great that we now haveeliminated our backlog and thatwe can test in a strategic way.



Okay, we'll move on to the next question.



Your next question is fromshawn jeffards with the canadianpress.
Go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Dr. Donnelly, I'mwondering if you could walk us through that range there of projections for deaths, 3, 000 to15, 000, in a little bit moredetail.
Obviously, you acknowledged that this is a pretty wide range bu ti think that is the number that most people are going to look athere.
and probably a bit -- be a bitconcerned, afraid about how specifically can the province push that to the low end here of3, 000?



Yeah, a very good question, Avery good challenge to us all.
Let me give you a little bit ofcontext, because I appreciate that people will feel that even range of 3, 000 to 15, 000 may seem not just scary and intimidating but to many peopleunlikely.
and so I just need everyone at this point to pause and to consider carefully the following -- that every year inontario that we lose about 1, 350individuals to normal seasonalflu.
So in a bad year, we may well lose 1, 500 to normal seasonalflu.
Now when you think that the mortality of this disease is up to 10 times higher, and when you remember that we have novaccine, we have no specifictreatment, and this is a disease which is entirely new to thepopulation, then suddenly the figure of 15, 000 becomes entirely logical andincomprehensible.
Now that being said, we have in place as we've just discussed allot of social distancingmeasures.
That, taken along with the other public health initiatives that referred to, pushes back, if youlike, in the other way.
So the best answer that I can give you in terms of how we get closer to 3, 000 is that we need to bear down, we need to do all of the things that we're doing and these additional things that mentioned.



Follow up?

---

**Question**:

On the -- on the high end there, the 100, 000deaths that were possible, gather that this means in absence of any measures whatsoever to address thisissue?



That is correct.
and thank you for pointing thatout.
Because I do appreciate that people will find that figure understandably alarming.
So let me use your question just to state again very clearly that that is not where we are.
That is not what we believe is going to happen.
But that is why we needed to do all of the things that we have done thus far and it's why we need to continue to bear down.
If we all do a good job, if we all stick to these measures, we can get an end result somewhere between 3, 000 and 15, 000.
That is our closest estimate.
We will, of course, watch carefully for sophisticated emerging models as we move forward with this epidemic.



Okay, we'll move to the nextcaller.



Your next question is coming from Cynthia mulligan from CTV.
Go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi, doctor.
Could you spell out more what the average person needs to do. and does there need to be afull-on lockdown? do the emergency measures actneed to be put in place?



So the average person needs to do the things that they have been asked to do. They need to maintain physical distancing from others.
They should stay at home unless they are an essential worker or when they need to go out for essential tasks.
and those essential tasks need to be very tightly defined.
So, in other words, it is to getfood, it is to get pharmacysupplies, if those otherwise cannot be delivered.
If people wish to go out and exercise -- and I do understand why in this situation that people might want to do that --it is imperative that they do that on their own or perhaps as a couple or very small group with whom they already live.
It is not appropriate if one is out walking to stop in the normal way and to speak to neighbours or strangers because you need to maintain socialdistancing.
People need to maintain handhygiene.
They need to wash their hands regularly with soap and water.
They need to use alcohol-basedanti-bacterial agents when soapand water isn't available.
Those are the most basicpersonal things that people cando.



I just want to remind everyone on the line to try to please keep your questions towhat's on the slides.
The premier and the minister will be able to answer further questions later.
Cynthia, a follow-up?

---

**Question**:

I'm sorry, but myfollow-up is, doctor, ontariohas per population has the teststhat quÉbec has.
Do we have an accurate figurehere? or is there as much informationas you need to do theseprojections?



That is a very good question.
and what that points out again is that you shouldn't simply do projections based on tests confirmed cases.
It's also important to look at projections which are based on other things.
Sadly, in countries that have further on with the epidemic, there are a mounting number ofdeaths.
and in that situation what you track over time is deaths.
Because deaths are not subject to what would technically be called testing bias.
In other words, to any distortion that might be brought to the system because of the way in which you test.
So we have used various ways of looking at this, and so we are confident that the overall mortality that we referred to and the target mortality thatwe're now tracking towards, that is not affected by the number of tests or the way in which the tests are being done.



Next question.



Your next question comes from rob Ferguson with the "torontostar." please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hello Dr. Donnelly.
Just a quick question on themodel.
I'm wondering about it because -- and I'm not challenging it -- I'm just looking for an explanation.
We know that there are probably hundreds or thousands more people who have COVID-19 that --then that have been tested, because not everybody is gettingtested.
So how many people do you assume that has this beyond those who have tested positive? and is there a factor that youuse, like, is it five times the testing number or 10 times testing number?

---

**Question**:

Yeah, again, that'sa great question.
There are some models which actually work on that basis that if you like they makeassumptions.
About how many -- if you could call them unknown cases.
Let's be honest and frank.
There are clearly are many cases in the province that we don'tknow about.
That must be the case.
Because the evidence from around the world suggests that manypeople, particularly youngerpeople, can have this disease Ina very mild form.
They hardly realize that they'vegot it. and, therefore, the danger is that they can spread it to someone else quite innocently.
But, again, these models in terms of the worst caseprojection, and in terms of where we now think that we areheaded, are not dependent upon that sort of data.
Modeling and projecting is Avery inexact science.
In the early days of anepidemic, it's all about providing an important early steer to policymakers about what they should be doing.
That's what happened in ontariobecause as soon as command tables saw the figures that suggested that there could be an overall mortality of between90, 000 and 100, 000, they moved very quickly to shut the schools which was the right thing to do. Can I just through our moderator just remind journalists, colleagues, that I do have fellow panelists with me. and I think since the camera is just focused on one person at atime, and you might miss thatthere's experts both from the university side and from the health service side who you may also wish to ask some questionsof.



Okay, follow-up?

---

**Question**:

Yes, thanks for that explanation, doctor.
Just quickly, so what is the factor that you would estimate? you know, we have about low3, 000s, 3, 300, 3, 400 cases confirmed now.
What would you extrapolate from that to the number of actual cases out there?



Honestly, I think that isvery, very difficult to say because that is a product of what your exact testing strategy is at any one time.
and there's another factor inontario which is important to mention -- and I'm sure thatyou're aware of -- but that is that returning travellers fromoverseas.
So if I can use particularly the example of the so-calledsnowbirds who -- many of whomover winter in the united statesand then travel back to Ontario.
and, of course, that is a verychallenging problem for us and one that we need help from thoseindividuals with.
Because I think that it's veryclear that in many parts of the United states that this diseaseis highly prevalent.
So many of these people, again, quite innocently can travel backfrom the United States andperhaps don't realize that theyare carrying the disease.
and this is why these peoplemust -- must -- stay at home fortwo weeks.
They must go directly to theirhome when they come from theairport or other port of entry.
They should not be stopping todo shopping or anything else onthe way home.
While they are at home they mustabsolutely reduce to as close tozero as possible their contactwith other individuals.
I'm sure that you all see theimportance of this, which isthat otherwise these individualscould inadvertently feed thisdisease all over Ontario.
So if you know snowbirds, if youhave snowbirds as neighbours, please help them out.
Please drop shopping for themand drop pharmacy supplies forthem.
Please help them to do what I'msure they want to do, which isto keep everybody else safe.



Next question.



Your next question is fromjeff gray with the "globe & mail." go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi, doctor.
I wanted to ask about thatprojection, the 3, 000 to 15, 000projection.
I understand that the range depends on the distancemeasures, what we bring in an dhow well we adhere to them.
But can you talk a little bit more about how you came up with those boundaries and what level of confidence you have in thoseboundaries?



Well, those figures relate to the entire course of thedisease, which may be as I say over two years.
What people don't necessarily realize is that when there's an epidemic like this you can have second or even sometimes as mall third wave.
and so if you seeing ifs which are less than this, a lot less than this, it may be because people are only looking at the first wave or it may be as they were explaining earlier on that the particular model that he was speaking to is a model that is focused on the short term.
All of these models work in complementary way.
The sort of projections that I'mtalking about, the hundreds, down to somewhere between 3, 000and 15, 000, the purpose of that is to drive high-level publichealth measures.
The purpose of the sort of modelthat finny brown was talkingabout is to inform the work likematt andersen and his hospitalcolleagues in terms of preparingthe health care system.
So I think that it might beuseful at this point for me tothrow this across to steinne totalk about the way thatsophisticated model that he wasreferring to operates and itmight be that it's acontribution that matt wouldwant to make about how modelingactually allows us to take aninformed view on issues such ashow many ventilators we mightneed.
So --



I'm not sure that I can help--



Okay.
So anything that you want toadd, matt, on the use of models to inform health care preparedness and planning?



Sure.
and I don't know if it's direct to the question, but asdr.
Donnell has said, as we think about how do we create the capacity that's going to berequired, while we appreciate that the models can move -- and as I mentioned in My talk that first slide -- that we update that daily to try to maintain view as to where do we need to get to to support the system.
As Dr. Donnell has described, that can move around quite abit.
It's still helpful for us as we think about what is the scale that we need to move to to make sure that we're creating system that can support -- and, of course, as you have heard and as I think has been a theme throughout this meeting, where that model ultimately goes.
What these numbers ultimately come back to largely comes down to how well did we do as citizens to adhere to the socialdistancing.
We have that power and we have to execute that to keep our numbers as low as possible.



a quick follow-up.

**Question**:

and just connected to that point that you're makingthere, that the 18 months totwo-year horizon, does themodels assume the same level ofdistancing measures? or does it assume that over thattime as we get from first waveto second wave that thesemeasures are lifted in some way?



Yeah, a great question.
You're now getting into very complicated future scenarios that truly will require very sophisticated models and a very best scientific brains to look at this.
Look, what we're trying to do at the minute is to drive down as explained the reproductive --the effective reproductive number of the virus to belowone.
So this is not simply now about flattening the curve.
This is about chopping the top off the curve.
This is really about taking measures that drive down the number of deaths, the pressure on the health service.
and the idea of that is that it not only does those two good things but it does allow the potential if you actually completely suppress the disease to look very carefully around the province and to see whether there are places where it might be possible to selectively lift some of the social distancingmeasures.
I need to say that we are someway off before we could do that.
But the time to start thinking about that now is now.
and the time to thinking -- to start thinking about how modeling could inform that isnow.
and there are various things that you can do, including background testing.
The assumption that most of the world is working to, and we have to believe is correct, is that this is a disease that we will only get once.
and so if you do backgroundtesting, which doesn't tell you about whether you have the disease today, but tells you about whether you've had it in the preceding weeks and months, that can actually be veryhelpful.
Because in a place where there'svery little background evidence of infection, you clearly would need to be very, very careful about lifting social measures.
Because there is still a large proportion of the population who are vulnerable.
Whereas in a place, probably like -- more like the g. T.a. Where we have most of our cases, and, sadly, most of our deaths, then it might turn out that when we actually look at this thatthere's a higher level ofbackground infection.
and if enough people have gotthis disease and are now immuneto it, you do effectively movecloser towards the situationwhere you would have what'scalled herd immunity.
What that does is that it stopsthe chain -- it breaks the chain-- because when you havesomebody who is infected, mostof the people who they come upagainst have themselves alreadyhad the disease and, therefore, are not going to get it again.
So you can see that the way inwhich you might lift socialmeasures, the timing of when youdid that, is going to have to bedriven by some very complicatedmodeling, some really quitecomplicated science, and it'sgoing to have to be done in avery thoughtful and adisciplined way.



Okay, next question.



Your next question is from the reporter with the torontosun.
Go ahead.

**Question**:

Thank you, hello.
Does any of the modeling consider the general population donning some kind of mask?



These models have not.
In general, the accepted science in terms of masks has been that they really are best preserved for front line health care staff and for other appropriatefrontline health care providers.
I am aware that in some other parts of the world, it has become more and more common for the general public to wearmasks.
and we need to keep watching the evidence on this and what other places do. But in general with masks, it'snot so much that it protects thewearer, other than that in afrontline health care setting.
It really is more about protecting other people from an individual if that individual is themselves symptomatic.
I mean, simplistically it stops them from coughing or sneezing over someone.
But, of course, the person who is symptomatic, the person who is coughing and sneezing, shouldn't be out anyway.
They should be self-isolating.
They should be at home.
Now that doesn't mean that ifyou see somebody with a maskthat you should panic and assumethat they have COVID-19. That will almost certainly notbe the case because I think thatpeople largely are following, thankfully, the injunction tostay home if they're unwell.
But there are differences.
National, cultural, in terms ofmask wearing.
I think that masks in ourcurrent situation should bepreserved for those who need itmost -- our highly valuablefrontline health care workersand other emergency workers.
Matt, you have been veryinvolved in the P.P.E. Issue, the supply chain.
I don't know if there's anything that you would want to add?



Thank you, peter.
I think that I would just add that P.P.E. is a supply chainand this is our biggestchallenge in our health caresystem right now as we took toour preparations.
We have a sort of a significanteffort going on federally, provincially, within all of ouragencies to secure more P.P.E. We're also encouragingconservation methodologists metsacross our system.
and going back to Dr. Donnelly'spoint, the most important thingis the safety of our health careworkers and the people theyserve and our patients andfamilies and we move everythingin that direction to supportthem.
Thank you.



Follow-up?

**Question**:

Thank you.
The -- the worst-case scenario, the scary number, the 100, 000dead, that seems to be avoidedthrough a full social distancingmeasures for a long time.
I'm wondering, are you aware ofany jurisdiction that hassuccessfully been able tosocially distance themselves formore than a year or two years?



It's another great question.
Look, I think that people need to realize that these are truly, truly unprecedented times.
People have tried to think about historical examples when social distancing was requested and complied with.
and some people will point back to polio epidemics in the past.
But even then it wasn't on the scale that we're now having toapply.
and so when people reach for historical precedence here, they actually have to go back over hundred years.
They have to go back to the great influenza pandemic of1918.
When some places did undertake the sort of social distancing and other public health measures that we've been talking abouttoday.
The interesting thing about that is that when you read the history papers -- and there's Avery good one just a few daysago, actually, by -- not written by public health people but written by economists who looked at the effect of those places in the United States who had gone very rapidly for very rigorous social distancing measures.
So, in other words, the places that had closed the schools early and taken other necessarysteps.
and the interesting thing -- is that there's a huge difference if you then look at the mortality in those states.
and fascinatingly, there's difference in terms of the way that those states bounced backeconomically.
It seems that there is genuinely no dilemma between saving live sand saving the economy.
The smart science-based thing todo is to bear down heavily toprotect the vulnerable and, therefore, to get through thismore quickly than you wouldotherwise do so that the economyof your area can bounce back.



Next question.



Your next question comes fromchristina tanalia with CTV-24. Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hi there, thank you so much for taking My question.
Doctors, I'm wondering if you can provide some guidance onthis.
We consider that Toronto is the largest city in the province and you look at the projected numbers in terms of -- the projected number of deaths, can you attribute them geographically and attribute them to -- say, because Toronto's the largest city, for example-- that people in this city could perhaps expect the largest number of potential deaths intoronto?



So you would normally expect, of course, that the largest number of deaths to happen in the places that have the largestpopulation.
and it's not surprising, therefore, that the largest number of cases we have and the largest number of deaths from the outbreaks in nursing homes outside the g. T.a., they arefocused on toronto and theg.
T.a. But really the measures that one would take are the same.
One bears down heavily, whetheryou're in Toronto or whetheryou're in a smaller ontariotown.
I do think that there has been Avery responsible attitude taken to try and to ensure that federal government, provincialgovernment, and Toronto citygovernment, try and to keep very tightly in step because clearly if that were not to be the Case think that the public would be confused if there were different rules in one place than somewhere else.
and I do think that the politicians -- to all of those three levels -- drawing on the science have been very careful to try and to stay in step to limit the number of deaths whether that's in Toronto or theg.
T.a. Or elsewhere.



Follow up?

**Question**:

Thank you, doctors.
As the doctors who, of course, have the most information on this matter, I am already hearing as you're speaking concerns from doctors about the number of I. C.u. Beds.
Can you just be clear -- willthere be enough I. C.u. Beds bymonday here in this province? and how quickly do you thinkthat the province can ramp upcapacity?



So I'm going to turn to new Right to matt Andersen fromontario health.
He and his team have been doing lot of work in terms of ramping up capacity.



Great, thank you for thequestion.
and so as I have mentioned in my opening remarks, we right now have a little over 400 beds dedicated and open for covidcases.
We are able to grow that by another 900.
That is the number that we havetoday.
and in terms of -- also I would add that our current capacity across the province is at Little above 70% of our totali.
C.u. Capacity.
That's before we add the otheradditional beds.
What we see though is that thatnumber, 70%, is averaged acrossthe province.
So we are -- we do have to lookat load balancing.
Meaning that there will be timeswhen we will need to moveequipment to places that needmore equipment.
Occasionally we also need tomove patients from one place toanother to make sure that we'vegot the capacity required.
In terms of your specificquestion of having capacity at acertain point in time, it againgoes back to the points thathave been raised by Dr. Donnellyand Dr. Brown on socialdistancing and managing thedisease.
If we can keep the prevalence ofthe disease to a lower level, the capacity that we haveonline, or that we could bringonline, would indeed besufficient.
But if the capacity was to spikeor the need -- pardon me -- wereto spike, that becomes verydifficult to project.
and so what we do in addition tohaving the 900 additionalmachineses, ventilators andi.
C.u. Beds, we're also lookingto source more as this diseasegoes on and as that trajectoryis still in question.
So we can get as much supply inas possible to meet the demandsthat are coming our way.



Okay, we're going to move on but to just note that unfortunately we're running short on time so this is the last caller.



Your final question comes from Travis with global news, please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi there.
and any doctor can take this.
It follows up on christina'squestion and I'm looking at the slides here for the I. C.u. Capacity for COVID-19. and the green bar is theconfirmed numbers of cases andwe know that in the past whathas been projected and thereality of the situation has notaligned.
and it looks as though in theshort term that next week we mayrun out of I. C.u. Beds.
So what is being done to -- inthe next week to get some ofthese beds online and do youexpect shortages in the meantimeand how long would you expectthe shortages for?



So it's matt Anderson and I'mhappy to take that questionagain.
In the slide that you refer tothere's two lines on there.
and the first line which is the current open capacity.
and the second line is the additional capacity that we can surge up to in very short order.
So if this chart were to bear itself out to be absolutelyaccurate, which I believe that my model is to the left of the caution that is not likely that it will play exactly this way --but if it did, we would be able to bring enough capacity online.
Again, the challenge becomestwofold.
One is, do we receive -- does the demand actually fit thiscurve? and, certainly, if it's the bluebars, that would be a goodthing.
If it is the orange bars, that is not a good thing, that becomes much more difficult for us to meet.
and the second is what is theslope.
We've got this model out that it could spike faster which is another challenge for us forsure.
and though I said two, I should say that the third element on all of this is matching where are these cases happening versus where do we have the capacity in the province.
That is very difficult for us tomodel.
One of the things that we have done to try to offset some of the risk associated to that is that we have a provincial command table that is run by critical care docs and others to make sure that when an area in the province, if they find themselves in trouble, they can call this line and we can work together to see as I mentioned in the last question, are there either equipment that can be deployed to that area or perhaps are there patients that can be moved to another nearby facility that has the equipmentnecessary.
So many different things that we have tried to do to make sure that we've got the ventilator capacity and the I. C.u. Capacityin the province.
Again, going back to the earliercomments from Dr. Donnelly anddr.
Brown, so much of this comesdown to what is the rate ofdisease in our province.
Are we following the socialdistancing rules.
and are we doing everything thatwe can to contribute to keepingthe prevalence of this diseaseas low as possible.



The last question.

---

**Question**:

and we know thatthere's an issue with procurement in the past and we know that a lot of health care workers have tested positive.
As you know, president trump is using the act to stop exporting masks to Canada.
Will your projections change ifwe're not able to procure some of those n95 masks from the United states?



I think that from a modeling perspective I'd have to hand that over to peter or steinnieto predict if that changes on the model.



So, anything that changes the supply that we're anticipating, obviously, reduces capacity.
and as we look at an epidemicgrowing, that becomes a very, very, very tough place.
You know, I think that the key issue is what we were talking about with ventilators or talking about beds and the people who are working and providing care or talking about personal protective equipment, the single most important thing that we can do right now is to slow the spread of the disease.
Which then leads to fewer cases.
That's through the types of measures that we have talked about already in place or the other things that we can do in the province right now.
That's probably the real key at this point.
and the single most important thing that we can look at. But as you said, anything that reduces the supply and the capacity that we have here.



That's all we have time for, unfortunately.
Thanks very much.



**Rosemary**:

That is briefing from public health officials in Ontario and we'reexpecting to hear from premier ford at 2:00 eastern.
But he had warned yesterday that some of these projections and modeling would be grim, it would be difficult to hear.
Indeed, it's the first province in this country that has put an estimate or a projection on the table when it comes to the number of deaths.
The Ontario doctors there also warning that projecting and modeling is an inexact science, obviously, when they're dealing with a lot of unknowns.
But that the headline for today, certainly, that if no measure shad been put in place -- none whatsoever -- that possibly100, 000 people in this police pecould have died.
With the social and the physical distancing measures and the restrictions on movement and travel that are in place now, the shutting down of schools and essential services, non-essential services, rather, public health officials now saythat it could be anywhere from3, 000 to 15, 000.
Again, a wide range of projectedfatalities due to COVID-19. But another reason they say tokeep up these important measuresof physical distancing to limitthe spread of this disease.
Premier ford will be asked morequestions about this at the topof the hour.
I'm rosemary barton.
Thank you for watching ourongoing coverage.
Andrew nichols will pick upafter this short break.
