World on CBC News.
Ca. We will of course bring you to the Prime Minister's daily briefing.
Today he is expected to talk about some of the most vulnerable Canadians in the midst of this pandemic.
Specifically we are hoping to hear more about help to food banks and other groups.
So that's still to come at around 11:15. The Prime Minister and the government is under some growing pressure to release modelling data on how many could get sick and die from COVID-19. The Prime Minister said some of those numbers will be coming outsoon, that they're working on the analysis of the raw data which is readily available, but we'll hear some of those numbers next hour from public health officials in Ontario.
Premier Doug ford said the projections may be difficult to hear.
He calls them grim.
CBC news has obtained some of the information that we will start to hear next hour.
Cbc's mike crawly joins us.



**Reporter**:

What I've learned from My sources is that the measures that Ontario has taken so for, these projections are going to show that, in fact, the physical distancing, the state of emergency, the closure of all of these businesses has prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of COVID-19 over the course of the coming months and by doing that has also prevented thousands of deaths.
These projections are also going to show in the coming weeks if Ontario does not take stricter measures right away, a couple thousand more people could stilldie.
So, in other words, if you look at the other side of that, if Ontario does impose even stricter measures today, immediately, the projections would suggest that hundreds mo relives could actually be saved.



**Rosemary**:

We are expecting an explanation around the modelling at noon.
We're going to talk a doctor shortly because these are projections.
It doesn't mean this is the way the outcome has to happen.
There are ideas how they think it will happen.
Just to couch all of those things, mike, can you tell us anything why there has been this shift in the premier's thinking around releasing the data? there was a point earlier this week where he wasn't sure he wanted to, and yesterday he was definitive about it?



**Reporter**:

It's been epidemiologists, the people who study the pattern of how the disease spreads, who have been pushing the province to give more raw data.
The only way they can make these projections is by seeing detailed information about how many people are contracting the virus, when did they contract it, how many people are being admitted to hospital.
It's been a little bit like pulling teeth to get that information from the Ontario health ministry.
Because Ontario's testing regime was not as widespread as it could have been and also because of so many delays in the tests, the data wasn't very good, so the epidemiologists couldn't come up with these projections.
Premier Doug ford is talking about this as the province's projections.
That work is being done by experts in public health, experts in epidemiology who work in some of the institutions that are behind me, the university of Toronto, there's a school of public health affiliated with the university of Toronto that'sjust behind me here in Toronto.
They have been wanting to crunch these numbers.
The information that is going to get released by the province is the work of epidemiologists based on this provincial data.
Now, I believe that the data ha snow been more fully shared with the scientists, but there's still a desire to have more accurate and up-to-date information to come up with these projections.



**Rosemary**:

Mike crawley, we'llcome back to you.
Thank you.
We appreciate it. Cbc's queen's park reporter mikecrawley in Toronto.
We are awaiting the briefing from public health officials at noon.
We are going to bring you that because of the importance of the numbers to the audience.
B.c. Has already done this and we did give you a full coverage of that.
Instead of going to cabinet ministers federally here today, we will go to Ontario.
Doug ford, the premier, will speak at 1:30. First let me go to isaac bogoch.
He is a regular contributor to cbc news.
Doctor, I'll get you to react towhat mike told us there.
It is not obviously specific numbers.
It is trends that seem to suggest that, one, what Ontario is doing has been working but more needs to be done.
What is your reaction to that?



**Isaac Bogoch**:

I think hopefully that's the message from premier ford.
I mean, we've heard him speak yesterday talking about radical transparency with the data, figures, and the projection, butthat's the right approach.
There's no sense sugar coating it. The citizens need to know what we're in for.
He used words like there are stark figures and it will be a sobering discussion.
That's completely fair.
We need to know what we're up against, how we're doing, and what we need to improve to really protect people in this province.



**Rosemary**:

Tell us the disadvantages of epidemiology modelling.
What the things that it can't do?



**Isaac Bogoch**:

Well, models are really -- of course there are going to be strengths and weaknesses with the models and certain assumptions, for example, that you make with models.
So there might be some degrees of uncertainty with many of these projections.
That's okay.
That's expected.
This is not a crystal ball, but it does tell you within some range of certainty where you're going to land.
You know, I think it's extremely important that we know what thatis.
This is the kind of situation where I think more information is better, but of course it's not just more information.
It's more information placed in the appropriate context.
So let's not just discuss what the numbers are, let's not just discuss what the models project.
Let's talk about the strengths and weaknesses of the model and how we interpret that data in our day-to-day lives.
Are we doing a good job with physical distancing.
Do we need to do more or take additional measures to prevent transmission in community settings.
These are the questions that will be addressed at the meeting.
I look forward to it. I don't think anyone would be opposed to radical transparency at times like this.



**Rosemary**:

You get no argument from a journalist at a time likethis.
Dr. Isaac bogoch, we'll leave you there.
He is an infectious disease specialist.
I want to bring in "power & politics" host Vassy kapelos andcatharine Cullen.
I should point out that the information is reliant on the province's information.
There is a dependency on how much they can give, but there are calls for the federal government to do more.



**Vassy**:

There have been calls all week and the Prime Minister responded yesterday by saying the analysis of that raw data, as you pointed out, would be readily available and coming soon.
He would not qualify what soon means.
We don't know how quickly that will come out, but it is mirroring what we're seeing fromontario.
They're getting the same questions that premier ford was earlier this week.
and that was can you provide for us the raw data, what does the modelling show.
The Prime Minister continues to point out that those scenarios will definitely be impacted on the behaviours that we exhibit and follow the rules of physicaldistancing.
The pressure is on the federal government to release those numbers.
I would point out, as you said, that a lot of that analysis depends on the raw data that they get from various provinces.
Some provinces like Ontario have that data to produce or the analysis of it today.
I spoke with Blaine Higgs, the premier of New Brunswick last night, and he won't have enough cases in his province until next week to provide to the federal government.
That gives us a sense when the federal government will be able to provide the model.
If they don't have numbers from New Brunswick, it may be hard to paint a country-wide picture.
Timelines are an issue for the Prime Minister.
I guess based on the modelling we're going to hear from premierford, there will be more questions for the federal government as far as that is concerned.



**Rosemary**:

We know that it came up on the call the Prime Minister had with the premiers.
I want to talk about another issue around personal protective equipment in relation to something that the white house is trying to do with a private company 3m who is probably the biggest producer of n95 masks, those high-grade medical filtering masks that are used inhospitals that are so critical during a pandemic.
For that, I will go to catharinecullen.
This is an odd story, but one that the Prime Minister will getasked about.



3m in the United States putting out a statement that it is sounding the alarm what is happening with the masks.
It says the defence production act has been invoked and they are going to require 3m to prioritize sending those to fema.
In the statement 3m goes on to say the administration has also requested, I think requested rather than required is important, the administration has requested that 3m cease exporting those masks that they currently manufacture in the United States to Canada and Latin America.
3m thinks there is a significant humanitarian implication of that.
There is a shortage of these masks in Canada and in Latin America.
If 3m stops exporting, they feel other countries could retaliate.
This is all part of a bigger picture, rosemary.
There is also a story out of the"associated press" to do with masks.
a german official saying the United States are employing wild west methods.
There were hundreds of thousandsof masks destined for berlin police and the United States managed to reroute them.
We know there's been an ongoing discussion about provinces that are particularly in need having enough personal protective equipment.
We know from our provincial sources that the conversation last night with the Prime Minister and the premiers, that all the provinces agreed that the provinces that are most in need right now should have priority access to federal supplies.
If there are provinces, and we know that there are, talking about perhaps only having a few days' worth of supplies left, they would be at the front of the queue.
But certainly the prime ministerwill face questions about what the implications are of moves like this and what Canada can do to convince the United States to frankly share.



**Rosemary**:

I guess there's some questions around whether the defence act that the United States is using around procurement in that country could force the hand of 3m in the United States.
There is a statement from 3m Canada in relation to this, saying they are aware of the memo from the president of the United States and saying "our primary concern remains the safety of healthcare workers and first res ponders during this crisis.
They are looking at meeting the domestic needs." there is a 3m Canada.
They are looking at this move from the United States.
I'm sure the Prime Minister will get questions about that.
Some other sad news, there are four more people who have died in bobcaygeon in the pine crest long-term care centre.
That is a total now of 20 residents who have died in the pinecrest nursing home and I believe one volunteer.
We talked to one of the doctors who was an attending physician there a couple of days ago.
This is what he feared that thiswould continue and it was the fear of public health officials that once this gets inside thesefacilities with limited capacityfor isolating people that it's hard to prevent fatalities.
Four more dead at the pinecrest long-term nursing home in bobcaygeon, Ontario.
Vassy, I'll go back to you and this equipment issue with the United States.



**Vassy**:

This is a tough one, Rosie.
As Catharine points out, there was already a backdrop against which this was happening and the need for supplies in this country.
We have been talking about how various provinces have various needs and some, including quÉbecwho has a huge need, is say is sing there is only days left until they run out of some of these crucial supplies.
This further complicates things.
We had been hearing about increased competition around theworld.
The report about supplies being cut off to be shipped to the United States is an additional layer.
Even when you bring in 3m, the statement you read out, there is some will there obviously.
But I think the question is how are they able to continue distributing, for example, n95 masks in Canada in the face of the president invoking this act.
It sounds like they're not sure how it will play out.
They raised the issue of the humanitarian questions that it raises if they stop distributing things like that in Canada.
The law was created in 1950.
It's a war time law.
How does it apply in this context and what implications does it have.
I know in conversations with those that work for the Prime Minister, they are seized with this issue and concerned about the possible impact.



**Rosemary**:

Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
