**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] hello.
Thank you.
My question is for you, ms. Freeland.
If you could give us a summary of your talks with the americansyesterday regarding the medical supplies that were turned away from Canada and what do you think of the trump administration's decision to demand that 3m stop exporting masks to Canada? what could the implications be?



**Answer**:

All right.
Thank you for your question.
This is a very important question on an important issue for Canada.
Our government is very engaged on this issue.
This morning Minister -- one of our ministers had a very good conversation with the head of 3min Canada.
I want to thank the company for what it stated publicly regarding their position.
Now, with regard to the United States, our government has begun very strongly explaining Canada's position regarding this issue.
It's team-work for team Canada.
I was speaking with ambassador hillman just 20 minutes ago before this press conference.
We understand how important thisissue is and all the ministers, the Prime Minister, myself, our emphysema in the United States even, the premiers of the provinces are committed and engaged.
We are trying to fix this issue.
We have started speaking with our partners and neighbours and allies in the United States regarding the longer term, our cooperation in our fight againstthis virus.
It is really an important issue.
The government is engaged in solving this issue and we will continue to work on that.
May I respond in english? [end of translation] thank you for the question.
This is an important issue and our government is very energyically working on it. Minister anita anand, our Minister of procurement, had a good conversation today with thec.
O. of 3m Canada.
I would like to draw everyone's attention to the company's very helpful statement issued earliertoday.
We are working energetically with our United States counterparts.
I want to emphasize this is a whole-of-government effort.
All ministers are going to be and are reaching out to their United States counterparts.
The Prime Minister is very personally involved, as am I. Just 20 minutes ago I spoke to ambassador hillman about the plan that we have put together to really press very hard on this.
We're also getting some of the premiers involved too.
An important issue and we're going to pull out all the stops on this one.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] now in the same vein, ms. Freeland.
From the beginning of the crisis, we know that the United States has had problems managing the crisis.
There were threats to deploy the army and now they're asking that medical equipment not be exported.
I mean, what kind of is the United States turning out to be at this time in your opinion?



**Answer**:

The United States is our only neighbour really.
This relationship is a very important one for Canada, as allcanadians understand.
It is very important in terms of the economy, in terms of the social aspects of our lives, and also militarily.
As Canadians understood, it is relationship that's very important in terms of health.
For each Canadian and every Canadian government working with the United States and representing and defending the national interest of Canada in our relationship ISS priority.
It remains a priority and it is for the government.
I cannot tell you it's always an easy job, but I can tell you it is a priority for us and I can also tell you that every Minister, starting with the Prime Minister, has a good relationship with their United States counterpart.
I could perhaps add just one more thing.
The coronavirus is a global pandemic.
It is not surprising that faced with a worldwide pandemic, all countries are finding themselves in a crisis, in an emergency situation.
During a global crisis, it's normal to find this kind of issue cropping up between countries.
I can assure you that Canada will continue to defend itself interests, as we did to solve the issue of military personnel at the border.
[end of translation] all Canadians understand that the relationship between Canada and the United States is an essential relationship for our country.
This is a relationship that is extremely important for the Canadian economy.
It's a relationship that is extremely important when it comes to Canada's security in the world.
I think we're now understanding it's a relationship that is very important when it comes to meeting our healthcare needs.
In times of crisis, like this global pandemic, all relationships at every level can face challenges.
This is no exception.
Having said that, we have been working extremely effectively with the United States throughout this pandemic.
The reciprocal and collaborative way we reduced travel between our two countries is an example of that, also the way we resolved the placing of United States troops at our border which we opposed.
We're going to continue to face challenges in this crisis that every country has.
We're going to work hard to resolve them.
I want to assure Canadians this is a huge priority for our government.
The good news is that every Minister in our government, starting with the Prime Minister, has a very effective working relationship with his or her counterpart.
We have a great --
