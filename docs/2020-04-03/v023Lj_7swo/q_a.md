The first question is from Elena dibs.

---

**Question**:

My question is for Minister hajdu.
More and more people are asking for scenarios that you have or don't have.
The Prime Minister this morning said that you first want to make sure that the data is consistent.
So I want to hear you on how consistent is the data, especially from Ontario, and maybe also from British Columbia.
Are you okay with the numbers that you see? do you think they do represent the reality?



**Answer**:

For the question I'llstart and then turn to Dr. Tam for some specifics.
First of all, I echo the Prime Minister's statement that in order to do modelling we need accurate data and the provinces and territories have been working hard to get to a place where they can provide us with that.
We have facilitated that by providing portals and all types of technical support for them to be able to provide as much granular data as possible.
All of that data feeds into the modelers both in the government of Canada and other modelers that are professional modelers from our academic society and research community.
The reason why this is a difficult question to answer is it's because each particular scenario depends on a number of different measures.
Let's just take, for example, what we could anticipate in terms of the volume of deaths incanada.
In order to actually answer thatquestion, we have to get a better handle on how many people we anticipate will be infected in Canada based on what we currently see in terms of infection rates.
Of course that's dependant on the number of measures that are taken in various jurisdictions and how stringently they're being applied or listened to by Canadians.
It also depends on the number ofcanadians that end up hospitalized and in some cases using intensive care services.
All of that depends whether or not Canadians apply those measures in their own lives.
That's why it's hard to give modelling that's accurate.
Having said that, that's the work that we're doing right now, to give Canadians a better sense in the days to come.
Should we be able to see a mild outcome, moderate outcome, more severe outcome.
and what kinds of decisions, what kinds of measures, and what kinds of capacities would affect those outcomes.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam, and maybe you can speak about the work you're doing to get the data from provinces that would help us with that modelling work.



I think everyone is working hard to get the information.
Right now I would say we are looking at how do we interpret the information we receive as well.
So when we talk about modelling, there are many different types of modelling.
There are scenarios for planningpurposes, where you could have ate am look at how many percentage of the population may get sick to plan ahead for your hospital beds.
What we're doing with the provinces is taking the data, like the positive and confirmed cases, to see if we can track where we're heading.
You can't go too far.
You can't guess months down the road.
What you're looking at whether the numbers, the numbers that we get reported every day are reporting us to a certain direction, whether that curve isbending.
Let's try and figure out is the curve bending, it's in early days, as we've said.
The next weeks are very important.
We're not expecting to see too much at this point.
In setting up that curve and looking at whether it's bending, what we're doing is fine-tuning the interpretation of our information.
B.c., for example, we need to know exactly what happened to their testing strategy.
As I've just said, the testing strategy depends on where you are in the epidemic curve, how wide a net you might be casting.
So until we get the nature of the testing strategy at each point in time, that will help us to see if we can compare the data from each of the jurisdictions.
It's not easy because people are tested all over the country and we need to make sure we understand how to interpret.
Now, public health, of course, as I said, don't just move on perfect data.
We will take what we have and make the most of that in terms of giving us our best interpretation as to where this epidemic is heading.
We also do have packets for each of the different areas of Canada.
They're not experiencing the same outbreak and the same trajectories.
So we are relying on each of the jurisdictions where they don't have the modelling capacity to get that done in each of the provinces and territories.

**Question**:

Okay.
So, Minister hajdu, if I can go back to Ontario, what is being seen in Ontario is not enough testing.
Do you share the concern about the way Ontario is handling thissituation?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question.
I'm going to turn that directly to Dr. Tam because she is much more closely linked with the public health officers of Ontario and can answer it from am ore precise place.



So I think the evolution of the outbreak is, as I said the timing and everything is a little bit different.
B.c. Started a little bit earlier.
I think the Ontario situation --Ontario is a very vast place.
So -- and they're at some of thebeginnings of that epidemic curve.
So I think we will provide support as much as possible to Ontario to enhance the testing capabilities for sure.
We want to absolutely, though, as I said, test and focus the testing in the most high-risk situations if you like.
You must test long-term care facilities, healthcare workers, and all of those situations where the tests result in a significant public health action.
So you must control those outcomes.
Making sure that's where you're focusing is very important for Ontario, particularly, for example, in the toronto area right now.
It may be reasonable then to cast the net wider elsewhere in Ontario where the disease epidemiology might be different.
So it's not a simple answer, butall I can say is they need more testing capacity.
We are absolutely working together to make sure that capacity is improving.
We can certainly provide you more information in the upcomingdays.



Thank you, doctor.
Operator, question.



Next question.
Thank you.
The next question is from Jamie paselgum.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Thank you.
My question is concerning Canada's prisons and jails.
People with respiratory illness, they may see that this epidemic is almost a death sentence for them.
What is the committee doing for them?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question.
We are very aware of the particular challenges that people in jail and the people working in jails and prisons face in this situation.
Minister Blair is very seized of this issue and addressed it at the COVID-19 cabinet committee earlier this week.
He and his team are working very hard to ensure protective measures are in place to protect both inmates and guards.
You're quite right to focus on this issue and we are as well.
Minister Blair is looking at whether further action may be necessary.



If I can just add Dr. Tam Hausa few words because she's been working on this issue as well.



Correctional facilities are one of the high-risk settings and they are -- precisely when we talk about lab testing, we need to be able to provide lab testing to those settings.
They are one of the highest-priority areas for focusing our lab capabilities.
We provide guidance to these types of settings and also the medical officers at the federal level at correctional services Canada is part of our group of chief medical officers who are constantly looking at the evidence and looking at how bestto protect this population.
Of course the key is to not introduce this virus into that setting.
So the preventive measures whichare really, really important, I can't stress enough about that.
So absolutely double down in prevention of the virus.



Thank you, operator, one last question before we turn to the room.

**Question**:

I had a follow-up. My question is for Mr. Miller.
You mentioned 305 million going out to communities.
Could you clarify, has that begun now? are communities now receiving this money?



**Answer**:

Thank you, Jamie.
Two things occurred.
We had emergency funds in our regional offices that have been dispersed.
That is only a fraction and not included in the 305 million.
That has to the best of My knowledge been distributed.
Over the course of the weekend, My regional offices sent out letters on late Friday, early Saturday confirming the individual community allocations.
Those have been received and dispersement is expected in the next week.



Next question.

---

**Question**:

Good morning.
Minister hajdu, I think this is for you unless it's for Dr. Tam.
I would like to go back to the medical equipment that was promised for quÉbec.
Yesterday it was said some equipment would be delivered in the next few days.
I would like to know what day it will be shipped to quÉbec, what equipment is being shipped, what quantity of that equipment is being shipped.
Also on the 10 million masks that the Prime Minister mentioned is going to be delivered and redistributed to provinces, can you tell me what portion of that is going to go to quÉbec?



**Answer**:

Thank you for the question and I'll give you numbers.
I know there is interest in personal protective equipment and what's gone out.
Since the start of the week we've received over 10 million masks thanks to medic om and overnight we received a shipment of 1.1 million masks from a supplier in Hamilton.
We also got 500, 000 masks from the jack miff foundation and some from the stockpile that will be going out.
We are in the process of shipping 174 ventilators and more are being dispatched.
We have more shipments on the way.
The procurement Minister and her team are doing an amazing job Ina difficult procurement landscape.
In terms of what is going where, that work is happening with the provinces and territories through the special advisory committee that Theresa works through and through the deputy ministers of health.
That is a very difficult, as you can imagine, conversation, but important one because the provinces and territories are working incredibly collaboratively to make sure that not only their needs are met, but we can anticipate surges in parts of the country as they occur.
I cannot give you specific numbers of which provinces and territories have received what.
Certainly you can ask various ministers of health if that is information they want to share, but at the federal level we are encouraged about the collaborative nature of these conversations in a difficult time.
That is what we need to see, Canada pulling together.
Provinces and territories obviously preparing for their own particular scenarios and their own particular surges.
Also to be understanding that if product is needed across the country in an area where there is an surge, that they will be there to help their fellow Canadians.
We have seen every indication that that's what's happening.

---

**Question**:

Thanks for all the numbers, I appreciate it. Maybe if you can't give me the specific numbers, can you tell me how all those resources are being allocated.
What I mean is, is it in a percentage where there are the most dire needs, they get a bigger percentage or through the regular proportion of the population of Canada.
I.e., quÉbec and Ontario would get 20, 25%. My other question is we've seen some smaller distributors in Canada who are trying to order shipments of medical equipment but are getting outbid by the United States amongst others and they can't keep up in the bidding war.
I'm wondering if there is any potential role for the federal government.
Could the federal government sort of take over being in charge of these orders of medical equipment to avoid that smaller distributors get outbid?



**Answer**:

That's technically two questions, but I'll answer them both.
On the allocation formula, part of it is population based and part of it is based on need.
It is a careful formula based on the population, but the ability to rapidly deploy resources to an area we see a surge.
Those proportions are being worked on now.
At the end of the day what we would like to see and what we'regetting is a consensus from all provinces and territories that the formula meets their needs and they're comfortable with that formula.
In terms of bidding wars and people scooping orders and all the other kinds of crazy things that are happening in the procurement space of personal protective equipment, certainly I've heard those stories as well.
That's why we're encouraging provinces and territories to work closely with us to do bulk procuring at the federal level.
It gives us bigger clout when team Canada is buying products.
In terms of that work, obviously we know that provinces and territories do have separate orders and we encourage them to communicate that to us so we can keep an eye on those orders and assist them as well with any logistical challenges that they're having.
We've contracted services for domestic distribution through amazon and other providers, and that will help make sure things can get to places very quickly in Canada.
We also have the capacity to help them with orders that are stranded around the world.



[voice of interpreter] thank you.
Question from the room.

**Question**:

My question is morems.
Freeland.
Does Canada support global coordinated cuts in oil production and is it involved in talks with the United States, Saudi Arabia, or Russia or others about limiting production?



**Answer**:

We are very aware of those reports and we have been concerned for some time about the ways in which the actions ofrussia and Saudi Arabia have disrupted the world energy market that has had grave consequences for the Canadian energy sector and for the Canadian economy more broadly.
That is something we are really focused on. Canada has been in very close contact with the United States about this issue.
I have spoken with secretary Pompey about it. Our ambassador Kirsten hill man has been working closely with the state department on this issue.
We have also been in close touch with both the province of Alberta and leaders in the Canadian energy sector.
Just late last night I spoke to premier Kenny about many things, but very much including the global energy market and also with Russ gierling and Minister o'regan has been in very close touch with his Alberta counterpart and also with his United States counterpart.
So we have been very engaged.
We are watching the situation closely and are very involved.

---

**Question**:

So is Canada considering participating in a global coordinated effort to curtail oil production?



**Answer**:

Let me just say that this is a very fast-moving situation.
The current situation in the global energy markets is something that we're very concerned about, the impact on Canada, on the canadian energy sector, and on the canadian economy for broadly has been negative at a time when our economy is suffering a lot of other strains.
It's too early to say how this situation is going to develop, but we're very closely engaged.
I would also like to say premierkenney is very involved and he has also been personally involved in conversations with the United States and that has also been very helpful.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.

**Question**:

Minister Freeland, the people that make up the short fall that CERB won't cover, should they run up their lines of credit or their credit cards? there hasn't been much forward-thinking what happens after four months, where should they get that credit?



**Answer**:

I don't agree with many of the premises packed into that question, but let me just say the following.
The government of Canada very much understands that the impact of the coronavirus, both on the global economy and on the Canadian economy has been huge.
We also understand that the steps we are strongly urging Canadians to take to protect the health and safety of all of us have a devastating economic impact in and of itself.
That's why the government has stepped up with the largest economic response in Canadian history to support the Canadian economy, with the CERB to support people who have lost their jobs or can't work because of the coronavirus, with the 75%wage subsidy.
That in and of itself is the biggest economic program of any Canadian government and with huge injections of liquidity into the financial system to allow banks to lend.
This is truly an immense response and, that's right, it is commensurate with the size of the issue.
Now, you asked what happens after four months and to that point I would like to say that Canadians this situation is under constant review.
I don't have a crystal ball and Dr. Tam doesn't have a crystal ball, no one does.
What I can assure Canadians is we will do whatever it takes for however long it takes to keep individual Canadians able to not just get by, but really support themselves in a decent way and to keep Canadian companies whole and sound.
So we are here for the long termobviously.
The government of Canada truly has the fiscal fire-power to do whatever it takes.
No g7 country entered this crisis in a stronger fiscal position than Canada, and that really should reassure canadiansthat we are there for them today.
These economic measures arehuge.
We are going to be there for them for however long we need tobefore the canadian economy -- until the crisis ends and it will.
This will end.
We can't say when, but we know it will end, and when it does our job as a government is to make sure individual Canadians and canadian businesses are ableto come roaring back.

**Question**:

My second question what I meant to clarify was are we providing -- are we asking banks to defer personal loans so much as the same action we've taken with businesses.
But My second question is for Minister champagne and Minister hied and Dr. Tam.
U.s. Intelligence yesterday, it was reported that it has been shown that china took steps to cover up the outbreak when it initially happened and continuing thereafter under reporting numbers to the W.H.O. and there are stories of them discrediting one of the doctors that discovered this too.
Do we trust china to provide accurate information to the Canadian government? and also, if we're making projections based on outcomes globally and what we see at home, how can we be sure of accurate modelling if the country that was the centre of the outbreak has been lowballingor hiding its data?



**Answer**:

I would say first off we are very concerned about thisinformation.
I just had a call with the NATO allies a few hours ago.
Canada gets its data from the world health organization.
We trust the international u. N. body to provide accurate information to different bodies around the world.
We can continue to do that, but we're very much aware of the stories that are going on around the world.
We need to speak with one voice in democracy upholding facts when it comes to a crisis like that.
People watching at home deserve data and the truth when it comes to actual data.
I can assure you not only we're working with the g7, g20, and NATO partners this morning, we are well aware of the fact that we need to work on a multilateral basis so that not only can Canada base its assessment on data, but also other allies.
I can assure you this, there's never been a better time to cooperate, consult, and coordinate in the world when it comes to this.
This is an enemy that is invisible and no knows -- knosno border.
I will turn over to Minister hajdu.



We don't rely on any one country's source of data.
It's the world health organization who coordinates thedata.
Dr. Tam is the special adviser to the committee that's been working on the pandemic since the very early days.
Dr. Russ eldrige led the committee to determine what they could do on the ground in terms of china's capacity to have a full understanding of what was happening.
There is no indication of the data coming out of china in terms of infection and death rate was falsified.
If you look at the death rate inchina, it's higher than the one we're seeing now.
So we rely on the world health organization to do this important work because of coursewe're all in this together.
I think one of the most important things to understand about this global pandemic is that as long as coronavirus exists in one country, it exists in all of our countries, that we actually have to work collective as a world now to defeat this virus, to find better ways to treat and then eventually prevent this virus through vaccination or other types of methods and that's going to take everyone working together.

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] --



Please let her finish.

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] --



**Answer**:

I would say your question is feeding into conspiracy theories that many people are perpetuating on the internet.
It is important to remember there is no way to beat a global pandemic if we're not willing to work together as a globe.
We will have to come up with a global solution to this virus.
No country is an island.
I am so proud of the Canadian researchers part of the world health organization solidarity project that are working on developing vaccines and treatments for this virus that undoubtedly are going to be a big part of the solution about how we all get ourselves out of this situation.



Thank you, Minister.

**Question**:

Ms. Hajdu, we know that hundreds of foreign-traineddoctors really want to help out in this situation.
We know that they've passed required tests, but they haven'tbeen certified by officials.
We're pointed to the fact that one of the first syrian refugeeswho arrived in 2015 is a doctor and wants to help, but he can't. is there any way to facilitate getting these doctors into the system?



**Answer**:

I'll give a general statement and maybe, Dr. Tam, this has come up on your special advisory committee.
Yes, the short answer is provinces and territories are looking at every possible way to get front line healthcare worker son the frontlines, including getting retirees back and including how we better get at the credentially for professionals.
It's difficult work.
I'm sure that Dr. Tam has more specific updates.



It's important to look at every angle at improving our health human resource during a difficult time.
Health Canada has initiated a recruitment approach, whereby --and I don't know if it's launched on the website or not, essentially is asking people who have the skill sets to do public health, contact tracing and other skills that provinces are looking for, to apply through that portal.
It's not the same as getting your licence.
That is a provincial licensure area.
But we would like people who think they can help in the health response to be applying through that portal.

---

**Question**:

The second question is for Dr. Tam.
At the health committee in January you said even though it was possible with people with symptoms to spread the virus but it was rare.
Now that we know it's not rare, I wonder if you regret being so definitive.



**Answer**:

People with symptoms are obviously very important in the spread of this virus.
We're always obviously looking at science as it evolves.
and we have of course had patients that are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.
What we didn't know before was how much that plays in the forceof transmission.
That impacts the science a bit and this is very much live in terms of the scientific community and in terms of its analysis.
It may depend on what setting you're in, as to whether that particular component plays any part in driving the actual outbreak.
So as I've said, areas like long-term care facilities, we now have to look at what does this mean exactly if -- particularly in patients or residents who can't really describe their symptoms or doesn't really -- they may be pre-symptomatic.
So all of this is currently being integrated in terms of thescientific analysis.
So if we have to change our approach, we will according -- because this is just the sciencethat's building up right now.



[voice of interpreter] thank you.
We're going to return back to the phone for three questions.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] My question is for Dr. Tam.
I would like if you can tell us in french how right now while you're saying that modelling and analysis will be coming shortly, what is important, what are you following right now to be able to give us this information and this analysis in the future.
Also, I'd like to know about your ability for projections in Ontario.
You live there.
What are you doing right now to increase capacity there?



**Answer**:

--



Dr. Njoo will answer the question.
Go ahead.



**Answer**:

Thank you very much for your question.
Dr. Tam and all our provincial and territorial counterparts are working together closely.
We have experts working on modelling and of course Dr. Tam has said every province has their own experts doing their own projections and modelling.
On the federal level, we're working closely together on projections.
But as we've already said, there are two aspects to this.
First, the quality of the data.
If we don't have good-quality data, our projections and what we're going to do in terms of results won't be reliable.
That's the first point.
The other aspect is that if we do modelling, it always depends on what we're doing now with measures in terms of physical distancing.
If we're really effective at this -- on this as Canadians, what we're doing right now will also have an impact on the modelling in terms of what we can expect in a few weeks.
So we're continuing to work together.
It's hard to give you figures because it depends on these two aspects, the quality of the dataas I said.
We're working closely together.
We know that the provinces and territories continue to work hard to give us the best-possible data.
The other aspect is that what we're doing now is very important.
It's critical because if everyone, if all Canadians continue to practice proper physical distancing, this can have an impact on the data and also on the outcome of the modelling.

---

**Question**:

and in terms of Ontario?



**Answer**:

Well, in terms of Ontario, we're enhancing their capacity for testing, and Dr. Tam and myself and our counterparts continue to work very hard to help Ontario's health authorities to enhance their capacity to test ontarians.
[ please stand by ]



We've reached an agreement with the United States to close the border.
We needed coordination --we had to allow truckersthrough.
Since the beginning, Canada has spoken tocountries.
We've even talked about air bridges that were in place during the second world war.
We have to ensure that essential servicescontinue, whether it is in terms of researchers or technicians or equipment.
Obviously supply chain shave been related to various initiatives.
I think the Minister was explaining that this is the plight of ourhumanity.
We're facing a commonenemy.
This pandemic that isworldwide.
