On the CBC news app and around the world on CBC News.
Ca. Canada has hit a milestone in the number of COVID-19 cases, more than 10, 000 now.
We are expected to hear more about that in the Prime Minister's briefing outside his home at Rideau cottage.
We will be having updates from officials and health authorities across the country.
We know that Canada's premiers and the Prime Minister will be speaking later today, we hear about 5:00 eastern, about the situation in their provinces and whether each province has enoughsupplies.
We will hear more about that as the day goes on. More than 10, 000 cases of COVID-19. 1, 800 Canadians now recovered from the virus.
We know of course that these numbers are not up-to-date by the minute and they don't reallypaint a picture of what is happening in terms of the pandemic inside our country.
The biggest concern right now isvulnerable populations like the long-term care centres, particularly the one everyone iswatching in bobcaygeon that havebeen hit hard, but also community spread which now accounts for 67% of new cases.
As we wait for the Prime Minister, My colleagues "power & politics" host Vassy kapelos andcatharine cullen joining me today.
That is a stark and maybe worrisome number for people, more than 10, 000 cases.
Obviously not everyone has been hospitalized and not all of themare in terms of intensive care.
We know that the fatality rate is about 1% or so at least in terms of the reported deaths that we know about.
and the general consensus from public health officials seems to be the healthcare system still has the capacity for this.
But more testing is being done and preparations for being made for what I think is fair to say, the deputy Prime Minister certainly said it yesterday, thefact that this is going to get worse before it gets better.
What are we expecting to hear from the Prime Minister today, Vassy?



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I think a lot offing -- messaging that you just laid out.
We got new details from the Prime Minister and the finance Minister where the wage subsidy is concerned.
I know there are a lot of people questioning what do I qualify for and how do I qualify.
Those details are now available.
Today is more focused particularly on messaging around heeding the warnings that we keep talking about and hearing from various public health officials, minding the physical distancing, staying inside as long as you can, only going to the grocery store.
There is a lot of anticipation right now focused on whether or not those measures are beginning to work, are we starting to see signs of that.
It does depend on the province that you're in. I think the call with the premiers will be significant.
Expect to hear something about that and the working relationship with the provinces right now.
When you talk, for example, about the level of preparedness that the hospitals in this country have, it does vary province to province and so does the hospitalization rate of this or the I. C.u. Capacity.
We don't even have the data necessarily from each province where those things are concerned.
We were talking about franÇois legault, the premier of quÉbec, laying out that he only thinks he has three to seven days of supplies.
and an acknowledgement from the federal government that their emergency stockpile is not enough.
I heard jason kenney say that they have what they need.
Newfoundland and quÉbec are worried about it. That coordination, the distribution of those supplies, and even the acquisition of themare all questions that the Prime Minister I think will get from reporters but also from premierslater today.



**Rosemary**:

I think that's a good point.
I will bring you in on that, Catharine.
QuÉbec accounts for half of the country's COVID-19 cases.
There are reasons for that because spring break happened before and because testing has increased.
We see in quÉbec much more extreme measures to try to make sure that nothing further happens.
This move to shut down the cross-border traffic between ottawa and gatineau.
But the concern around personal protective equipment seems real on the frontlines and is real inquÉbec.
Vassy is right, it does depend who you're talking to. I've talked to a number of doctors and nurses during these specials and the vast majority feel pretty well equipped.
It is hospital dependant and region dependant.



Absolutely.
Another striking statistic, more than 500 long-term care facilities in that province haveat least one reported case of COVID-19. So quÉbec struggling on a numberof fronts.
Putting in check-points in different parts of the province, trying to restrict movement within parts of the province as they deal with what is a growingoutbreak.
Certainly we can expect that to be part of the conversation withthe premiers later today.
The question of personal protective equipment is a major one.
The government announcing it will spend up to $2 billion to procure this personal protectiveequipment, but the questions arepressing.
Our colleagues on radio-Canada have a question talking about what is essentially the way it'sdescribed there certainly something of a war internationally, talking about equipment actually being bought off of airport runways essentially.
It's headed to one country and another country tries to buy it up. There is a competitiveness out there.
Public health officials in Canada trying to offer assurances, but the competition and that effort is an ongoing one.



**Rosemary**:

We did hear from the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, that quÉbec is going to get some more equipment.
It is something the federal government is hearing, but it is an ongoing challenge around the world and in this country.
As we wait for the Prime Minister to emerge there from his home, I want to go to Mona Niger in Ottawa, the chief science adviser in Canada, to talk about the testing and data parts that we as laypeople try to understand.
Maybe I can ask you to start with how you think we might be doing in Canada.
There have been lots of questions to federal officials around the data and trying to understand the data.
If you were to give us an example or comparison to anothercountry, south Korea, Italy, where would you say we're going in the scheme of things?



**Interview**:

Good morning.
I hope we're going more towards south Korea than Italy, althoughitaly is ramping up its testing and data sharing.
What you want is to be set up actually to do it before you hit the peak of the epidemic because this is when your front line healthcare workers are swamped with care and data becomes a sort of secondary issue for them.
So I think we've put things in place now and we have more data that's coming from the provinces from the national microbiology lab as well.
Let's hope we're heading in better position in terms of data.
We're calling for more testing.
I'm pleased in a we're having more testing done.
So the numbers should not necessarily scare us, but they reflect the fact that we're doing more testing.



**Rosemary**:

More than 250, 000 tests completed when we got the last update from public health officials.
Probably higher now.
We're talking about when we're going to hit the peak and Dr. Tam talked about that and how hard it is to determine.
Do you have any sense from the data you've seen about when we might hit the peak?



**Interview**:

It is difficult to say when we hit the peak and the peak may hit at different times in different provinces.
It's not necessarily the same time across the country.
I think Chinese numbers are telling us we're heading towards that in the coming week or two, but again it can vary greatly between one province and another in the country and for that matter in one area of a province to another.



**Rosemary**:

is there a province right now that is particularly troubling for you? I point to Ontario because it dust seem like there is a real lag in the data or a lack of data.
Would that be of concern to you or is there another place that is worrying?



**Interview**:

Well, based on what we're seeing and the number of tests, I have to say I am a little bit preoccupied by the situation in Ontario because we should be doing more testing in Ontario.
I hope that they're going to be able to ramp this up. I know they've decentralized the testing towards the academic hospitals as well and other academic labs are stepping in as well.
So I'm preoccupied by the lower number of tests that we're seeing in Ontario.



**Rosemary**:

What would be the key thing for Canadians to keep our eyes on? Dr. Tam and the Prime Minister have both signalled that this week, the next seven to 10 days or so, is really critical to seeing whether the physical distancing is working.
What are you keeping your eyes on over the next week or so?



**Interview**:

I think for sure the total number of tests that -- of cases that are recorded, but more importantly than this is the number of hospitalization.
I think that we have to be careful not to draw conclusions based on one day or two.
We really need to see a trend and a trend is several days, not just one or two days.



**Rosemary**:

What would the percentage of hospitalizations tell you right now?



**Interview**:

Well, given that the number of hospitalization --first of all, let's remember that the folks who are hospitalized, most of them actually recover and there's only a very small percentage that will go into more complications and ultimately perhaps death.
Nonetheless, the number of hospitalizations are telling us the severity of the cases.
The ones that are going to perhaps overload the healthcare systems, so that's why it's veryimportant.



**Rosemary**:

You had talked about previously doing more testing, particularly trying to start using the blood testing model, which would give us a sense of who has already contracted the virus.
Would you like to see government broaden the testing criteria an dhow quickly should that be happening?



**Interview**:

Yes, I think it's really important to appreciate that there are two types of tests that are being carried out.
Mostly right now one of them.
The other one hopefully we'll start doing it as well at a large scale.
The first one what we're doing now, the DNA Test, which determines who presently has thevirus.
The blood test determines who actually was infected and evidently recovered.
Together they give us a better sense of the percentage of people who have been infected and the number who had recovered.
This is very important in terms of calculating the exact infectivity rate, if you want, how many people are infected by one person.
The other is the percentage of fatalities and the percentage that are needing hospitalization.
and lastly, equally important I think, once we get over the crisis -- and I'm confident we will -- is to understand the measures that can be put in place for return to normal.
So the number of people who have developed immunity to this is extremely important.
In fact, it's important right now in terms of the deployment of healthcare workers and other essential services individuals.



**Rosemary**:

Can I ask you to weigh in on the mask debate.
There have been some -- maybe conflicting or unclear advice of whether it is the most useful thing for people not infected to wear a surgical mask or a homemade mask.
What is your opinion on that?



**Interview**:

First of all, I have to say that right now the most effective measure is social distancing or physical distancing and clearly washing your hands.
Without going to a lot of details about the masks, of course the masks are protective and that's why we want to have them for the healthcare workers.
Homemade masks are not as effective.
Sometimes even masks that are surgical grade masks, if you don't know how to wear them and -- there are a number of studies that actually show that people who are wearing masks still touch their faces and they touch their face sometimes more often than others.
It's really uncertain and unclear whether the masks would be effective.
Certainly right now putting the population out with masks is notrecommended, is definitely not the most effective way of dealing with this crisis.



**Rosemary**:

I only have about 30 seconds before the Prime Minister comes out his front door.
We talked about how we are doing in terms of other countries and testing.
Do you think we are close to flattening this curve? do you think we will be successful?



**Interview**:

I think we will besuccessful.
Again, it depends on every one of us. But certainly we have taken the measures earlier than other countries.
I am confident that we are flattening the curve.
I think the question is how flat is it going to be and that is dependant on all of us.



**Rosemary**:

Mona nemer, chief science advisor of Canada.
I appreciate speaking to you and picking your brain on these issues.



**Interview**:

Thanks and thanks to the media for your good work.



**Rosemary**:

Thanks.
We appreciate that.
As we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister to emerge for his daily update to Canadians on thepandemic, we are expecting, as we talked about earlier, that the Prime Minister will speak with premiers later today.
Of course premiers have also been in close contact with the deputy Prime Minister, who is chair of the COVID-19 committee, where they have been discussing the various challenges, both from containing this on a public health perspective, whether or not there is enough equipment in certain parts of the country, what more is needed, but also economically, which is the other huge challenge from this pandemic which will go on after this is over, but what are the messages we've been hearing from the Prime Minister and his colleagues is really this is not the time to let up on that physical distancing, that that is still so vital to making sure that we emerge from this faster and healthier.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
