**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:



[voice of interpreter] good morning, everyone.
It is clear that the last few weeks have been difficult for a great many people.
You were wondering how you could work from home and how you were going to be able to pay your bills after losing your job.
That can be tough to stay positive and it's normal for you to be frustrated, but if you are going through a particularly dark period, ask for help.
There are people out there who can help you.
If you think that friend or a member of the family needs help, give him a quick call.
Tell him that you are there to listen.
We are going through a difficult time now, but we're going through this together and help is coming.


[end of translation] this evening I'll be chairing a first ministers meeting with the premiers.
We're going to talk about how we can work together to keep people safe and supported.
Over the last few weeks in the face of an unprecedented challenge, we've seen all levels of government cooperating on a response and going forward that collaboration will become even more important.
We will be there to support the provinces and territories with whatever they need.
This includes sending personal protective equipment and other supports for the healthcare system.
Last night we received a shipment of over 1 million masks to a Hamilton warehouse.
I know people there have been working overnight to validate these supplies.
This is in addition to the 10 million masks that have come in over the last days and are being distributed to the provinces and territories as quickly as possible.
This team Canada effort goes beyond government.
About two weeks ago we launched Canada's plan to mobilize industry to fight COVID-19. Since then, we've spoken to almost 3, 000 companies, helping us secure millions of pieces of vital equipment.
I want to share a quintessentially Canadian example of this collaboration.
Our government has ordered hundreds of thousands of face shield from Bauer, the people who make hockey gear.
They're creating shields to protect nurses and doctors against COVID-19. This is exactly the kind of innovative, collaborative thinking we need right now, and I know we're going to see more of it in the coming days.
 

[voice of interpreter] tonight the premiers and I will talk about the coordination of our efforts and data sharing.
We must work together to identify what our communities need right across the country.
The provinces have made considerable progress when it comes to quickly analyzing the screening tests, which M.P. means that experts have new datathey need to look at. 

[end of translation] in our conversation tonight, the premiers and I will discuss our continued coordination and sharing of data modelling.
We need to work together to knowwhat's needed where and when forcommunities right across the country.
Provinces have been making significant progress on testing backlogs which is giving expertsimportant data to analyze.
We're constantly getting and validating more data.
That means we can share more information with you.
You can go to Canada.
Ca/coronavirus for the latest information about cases, growth, and spread.
I know a lot of people are stillwondering when this will get better or how much worse it might become.
You want to see the numbers and the predictions.
You want to wake up in the morning and look online for the latest, more credible data you can find.
You want to plan.
You want to prepare for the worst.
You want to know what to be hopeful about.
I know and we'll have more information keep coming to you with it soon.
But the biggest variable in shaping these projections is youand your behaviour.
You must listen to the world-class doctors who are already sharing the best available information and advice.
Ignoring them puts lives at risk.
It's up to you to do the right thing.
While many of you are staying home and limiting trips to the grocery store, too many still aren't. What the experts are telling us is that we must do everything we can today and tomorrow to set uson the right path for next week and next month.
It takes time for the effects of our actions to be felt.
So if we don't want our hospitals to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks, we need to make the right choices and we need to make them now.
Our public healthcare system is strong and our public healthcareprofessionals are remarkable.
They're facing a threat.
If every single one of us steps up now, we can help them.
If you listen to doctors, if youstay home, if yous stay away fromother people, we won't overwhelmour hospitals.
We will protect our doctors and nurses.
We will protect our friends and neighbours.
It's going to take distancing and time to flatten the curve, but that's how we'll get throughthis.
So let's save lives together by staying apart.
We will keep wording around-the-clock to get you the help you need to do just that.
 

[voice of interpreter] to protect your job, businesses, and wage loss, we have a three-point plan that will help you until things get better.
Thanks to the emergency wage subsidy, we are helping your employers to keep you on the payroll.
With the new guaranteed loans for all businesses, we have business owners who can now receive credit in order to come through these tough times.
With the Canada emergency benefit, we will be helping people until things get better, if you've lost your job or your paycheque.


[end of translation] I want you to know we're giving this fight everything we've got.
Yesterday we announced the biggest economic measures in ourlifetime.
Governments of all orders are mobilizing the most significant mobilization since world war ii. Doctors and nurses, truckers andair cargo operators are scaling up operations to levels we've never seen before in our history.
But here is the truth, none of that will be enough without yourhelp.
 

[voice of interpreter] the idea of servingone's country changes from one generation to the next.
Your grandfather may have gone abroad to fight a war.
Your mother may have fought for more equality, but now it's yourturn.
It's your turn to contribute to the general effort.
You can serve your country by staying home and following the rules.
I know that that may seem simplistic, but it's the only way to come through this trial.
Every single one of us has to dohis part.
We must all sacrifice our routine so that life will returnto normal at some point.
I know that we can and that we will together.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to talk about the supply chain and P.P.E. We're hearing all sorts of stories about medical equipment being diverted.
Have you been talking to the americans about medical equipment intended for Canada and the need for that equipment to come to Canada?



**Answer**:

Now, I was very, very concerned when I read the report about medical equipment being diverted.
We will follow up on that and we understand the concerns of premier legault and others in that regard.
We will be following up with ministers Blair and garneau to ensure that we know exactly what happened and particularly to ensure that equipment intended for Canada comes to Canada.
[end of translation] I've heard reports on this issue, and of course they're concerning.
We need to make sure that equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada.
I've asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports.
We are working not just here at home, but overseas as well to ensure that the equipment canadahas ordered makes its way to Canada.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] and will you or have you raised this issue with the United States administration? did you get any guarantees or have you already received such guarantees with the United States?



**Answer**:

We are working with the Americans and we are following up on that specific issue.
We are working together and we understand that the needs in the United States are very extensive, but it's the same in Canada.
So we have to work together to ensure that we can control the spread of this virus.
So we're working with the United States and we will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we have the equipment that we need.
[end of translation].



The next question, Alex baumgam, Toronto star."

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
You mentioned getting more information on the numbers and predictions soon.
What does "soon" mean and what predictions are you referring to?



**Answer**:

I think first of all we can highlight there has been tremendous transparency on the raw data, on the numbers, on the numbers of cases where they are, and we're adding to and collaborating closely with the provinces on making sure those numbers get out there.
The question of analysis of those numbers is the next question.
People want to know what the model is, how long they're likely to be in this situation, when kids can see their friends again, when we're going to be through this phase and get back to work.
Those analyzes depend directly on Canadians' behaviours.
They depend on whether or not people follow the rules around social distancing, around staying 2 metres apart, around isolation, about not going out for groceries more than once a week if you can.
These kinds of things will have a direct impact on which of the various models that are out there will be the one that we take.
We're going to continue to work on those analyzes and crunch the data and numbers, and we're going to continue to be open with Canadians about those expectations.
 [voice of interpreter] I understand that people want more information.
They want to know how long we'regoing to be in this situation, when they're going to be able to their jobs, and when they're going to see their friends, particularly the young people out there.
But we are sharing the data, in other words, the number of cases there are, where the cases are each day, so that people can know what's happening.
Through the they're also interested in the analysis of that data and the modelling that may let us know how long this could last.
Now, obviously those models depend directly on the behaviour of Canadian citizens today, yesterday, and tomorrow.
That's why it's so important that every single one of us does what is necessary, follows the rules, stays home, keeps a safe distance so that we can succeed in coming through this.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

You yourself described some of the scenarios as fairly dire.
Why is it that you can't release the projections that you have now, the range of scenarios that you talked about about things working to being fairly dire?



**Answer**:

I think people can imagine a range of scenarios that shows everyone gets suddenly better in the next few weeks to this situation just keeps getting worse and we face a situation like some other countries in the most dire situations have.
There is a range out and there highlighting that range is not as useful or important as being able to get clearer numbers and analysis of what we are likely to face.
Everything we are going to face will be directly linked to how people behave today and that is why it is so important that people stay home, that they continue with the social distancing, continue keeping 2 metres apart, continue to look to minimize their movements as much as possible so we can get through this in the best shape possible.
 [voice of interpreter] I understand that people may imagine all the different scenarios could be from not too serious to very, very serious as we've seen in other countries.
The important thing for us is to be able to provide realistic modelling and that depends directly on the behaviour of Canadians today, whether they continue to self-isolate and maintain the proper distance from others and their behaviour in general these days.
All of that will have an impact on what we see in the future.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Prime Minister.
Just along the same lines, those modelling scenarios, is it because you're concerned the data will cause anguish and panic? because a lot of people want to know where we're at. In other countries such as the United States, they are providing that information to citizens.



**Answer**:

Well, I do think it'simportant for people to get information so they can know what to expect, but at the same time the important thing is for people to know that their choices and their behaviour now have a direct impact on any model we end up seeing and what happens in the next few weeks ofself-isolation.
As I said, we're going to be in this position for several weeks and perhaps several months, but we need to send a clear message to Canadians.
In order to give clear information to Canadians, we need to analyze the data.
The fact is we are sharing data, there are models out there that people are looking at. There will be more to come in the days and weeks to come.

---

**Question**:

Your health Minister said that the healthcare system is not in a position to deal with a huge surge.
Now, why is it there wasn't enough P.P.E. In the national stockpile?



**Answer**:

Well, I think that many governments around the world are going to be reflecting on that very issue once we come through this and we will learn great deal from this experience and this crisis.
Right now the essential thing is to ensure that we are able to deliver the necessary equipment to the healthcare system, that we try and flatten the curve as much as possible so that we will not end up in a situation where our hospitals and healthcare system are overwhelmed and we no longer are able to care for people who are seriously affected by COVID-19. That's why everything we're doing right now is aimed at protecting people.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

Good morning.
I'm wondering if you could explain to us if you're not going to tell us what those analyzes say yet, can you tell us what metrics are going into that analysis? what are the key things you're asking to be told about that's guiding your decision-making right now.



**Answer**:

We have been working with the provinces to make sure we have the best-possible data.
There has been a lot of clearingof the backlog of testing in a number of different places over the last days that is giving us more accurate images on how COVID-19 is spreading, where it is spreading and how it's being transmitted and how the measureswe are putting in place are working.
I'll be speaking tonight with the premiers about this data andabout the modelling and analysisthat's going on. We look forward to being able toshare tore information soon.

---

**Question**:

I'm also wondering if -- you're talking about Canadians not staying home, that some are, but there are still too many that are not.
Does Canada have the ability and would you consider issuing a mandatory stay-at-home order?



**Answer**:

That would be part of the emergency measures act that could be brought in. At this point we've been working closely with the provinces that themselves have more measures and abilities to put in. We've seen certain provinces bringing in more and more stiff measures.
We will continue to work with them, and the federal emergency measures act really becomes necessary once provinces have existed all their significant powers under the emergencies act.
We're not quite yet at that point.

---

**Question**:

Other countries have been able to release detailed modelling.
For example, new Zealand is projecting a 65% infection late for its population, a 1% fatality rate and a 20% fatality rate for the Maori people.
I wonder why you can't release the data in your possession now for Canadians to prepare.
What's stopping you from releasing this information rightnow?



**Answer**:

One of the things we'll be talking about tonight with the premiers is how to make sure that all our various sources of data are aligned so that we can get more accurate models, how we make sure that the analysis that complies to the data that's being published daily so Canadians can see it reflects what's going to happen in Canada and in various regions across the country which will be different from what happens in other countries around the world.
That is sophisticated modelling work that's being worked on right now that is ongoing.
We look forward to sharing more with Canadians in the coming days.

---

**Question**:

What are your government's plans for returning cruise ship passengers from Florida, how will they get home? will they be quarantined or allowed to self-isolate at home?



**Answer**:

Anyone who returns from overseas needs to be quarantined for 14 days, needs to be isolated so they do not spread COVID-19 in the population.
We've received many, many Canadians who have returned home over the past couple of weeks.
There's still a few more to come, but far less than have come.
Those people have been isolating.
We ask people to make sure they don't stop in the grocery store on their way home from the airport, that they go straight home, that they isolate, that they understand they pose a real risk not just to their neighbours and loved ones, but to the entire country.
We need to make sure and will ensure that those people are isolated.

---

**Question**:

Respectfully, the question was specifically about these passengers from Florida.
Will they be quarantined or asked to go home?



**Answer**:

My understanding is they will be flown home on a charter flight, but we're still looking for those details.
We will ensure that they are isolated when they get home.
 [voice of interpreter] we understand that there is a charter flight that will be bringing them back to Canada and of course they will be isolated when they return.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

Just to go back on the modelling numbers, the data, why not release the numbers now if we're really trying to get Canadians to understand the difference their behaviour makes, given the warm weather, given that people want to go outside, why not release the numbers now so they understand how much of an impact their behaviour will make.



**Answer**:

We have released the numbers.
We're coordinating with the provinces to make sure that the data is consistent right across the country.
That is the numbers that we are putting through into various models.
As we get those models more accurate, we look forward to sharing them with Canadians.

---

**Question**:

Just to switch gears on china, United States intelligence reports reveal that china concealed the degree and the severity of the outbreak.
I'm wondering if Canada has the similar intelligence.
In the past we said we trust china and their information.
Do we still trust china and their information?



**Answer**:

We know that countries around the world have been sharing information on their cases and what has been effective in terms of measures.
We've learned a lot from south Korea and Singapore and other countries, we've learned unfortunately a lot from Italy as well about what worked and what didn't there.
We need to keep learning from other countries.
We also need to be really thoughtful at the process and understand that information.
Obviously, there will be many, many questions as this is all worked through over the coming months and indeed years about how this was handled, what lessons were taken, who did well, who didn't, and who was perhaps not as forthcoming with the global community as they should have been.
Those are questions, though, for future times.
Our focus right now is on getting through this in a way that keeps Canadians whole and safe.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize there is a great deal of information out there about what various countries have done and we can learn from what has worked or not around the globe.
In the months and years to come, there will be a great deal of reflection and analysis about what country did this, how did they manage the crisis, and whether there are countries that were not honest with the rest of the world.
Certainly, it will be important to know that, but for right now our emphasis and our priority is on how we can protect Canadians.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

The Canadian centre for policy alternatives released numbers today saying 800, 000 Canadians will get no income support, these were people unemployed or looking for work before the crisis.
They don't qualify for e. I. and won't get the emergency benefit.
Are you looking at anything to help these people?



**Answer**:

Yes, absolutely, we're looking at ways to help everyone in Canada that needs it. The two measures, the wage subsidy through employers, and the Canada emergency response benefit will help millions of Canadians.
We know there are many vulnerable people who won't be able to access this support.
We're making sure to flow funds through shelters and non-profit organizations and charities.
We are making sure our most vulnerable are safe and we're keeping communities safe and giving them support.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that even with the unprecedented measures we've introduced with the Canada emergency response benefit and help for employers and employees, there are people who will not qualify.
Therefore, we're going to continue to work to support the most vulnerable Canadians to protect themselves and the community.
That's why we will continue to reflect and see what we can do to get through this together.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

-- of course quÉbecnow has police check-points along the Ontario border.
If you enacted the emergency act, this could be uniform across the country.
Should we be locking down each province in lieu of that?



**Answer**:

I think each province is looking at what they need.
The northern territories brought in much greater measures earlier because they realize the extreme vulnerability of northern territories in a situation like this.
The federal government will provide the support to all provinces that need our support as we move forward.
Yes, there is a federal emergencies act that we can bring in, but as I said the moment to bring that in is really when there are things that the provinces and canadiansneed to see done that can't be done by the provinces.
We will continue to work very, very closely with the provinces and all jurisdictions to ensure that the tools that everyone ha sat different levels are used as they need to be.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] radio-Canada.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
As certain medical equipment becomes more difficult to secure, are you concerned that the provinces will become more protective of their own P.P.E. and perhaps not as inclined to share? is that part of your concerns and will you be discussing this with the premiers?



**Answer**:

We want to ensure that once we come through this time where there may not be enough equipment available, thatwe're in a place where Canadian production is sufficient for the entire country.
Even once we have enough for ourselves, to be able to share that equipment with other countries that need it. This is something we're working towards now.
In the meantime, we can ensure that all the regions receive all the equipment they need.
We know needs are different from one region to another.
That's why we're coordinating all of this with the provinces.

---

**Question**:

Mr. Trudeau, you seem to be -- have a bit of a scratchy throughout today, so are you still okay and healthy?



**Answer**:

Oh, yes, I'm very healthy.
I spend an hour with you every single morning and perhaps I should wear a scarf, but no, I'mabsolutely fine and thank you for asking about it. [end of translation] you might have noticed I've cleared My throat a couple of times.
There is nothing to worry about.
I have no symptoms of COVID-19. I should get back to wearing My scarf even though it's sunny.
Thank you for your time.



**Rosemary**:

That's the Prime Minister of Canada experiencing the same thing we all do these days, if you cough, everyone turns and looks at you and wonders if you're okay.
He says he is, indeed, fine.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos andcatharine Cullen watching the updates on me. I'll give some updates on equipment updates that I thought were important, that they received over 10 million masks and that Bauer is going to start making facemasks.
The message from the Prime Minister is really around data and how much data and information the Canadian government will be sharing with Canadians, given that they had about a week ago said they would share more.
It sounds like that is still theplan, but it isn't happening just yet.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I thought it was pivot yesterday from the positioning of the federal government and the Prime Minister yesterday.
Certainly more of an acknowledgement that Canadians are interested in that data.
There is transparency around the raw data.
We get to hear every day from the provinces how many cases there are, how many hospitalizations, so that is true.
What we're seeing in Alberta and British Columbia is more detailed modelling on various scenarios that could play out on not only projections, but current behaviours.
I would reiterate today that the prime Minister is right that our behaviours are going to obviously have a major impact on what happens.
That is why it's so why it's so important that we observe those rules around physical distancing.
People want to find out what scenarios we're dealing with, whether we go full out with mitigation efforts and whether some provinces don't, ET cetera, ET cetera.
What the Prime Minister said today is that he acknowledged that that data and analysis should be provided to Canadians.
He said it should come soon.
He predicated it on data sharing with the provinces and that information coming from the provinces, more testing being done and analysis of that testing, and then being sent to the federal government.
So we're still lacking a very specific timeline on when those models will be available.
He was pressed repeatedly about why can't they right now.
There was a more clear acknowledgement from the Prime Minister today that Canadians do want to know the -- they want access to the analysis.



**Rosemary**:

I think that's natural as human beings that we want a sense of how bad it mightget, when it might be over, what kinds of things we're looking at. The president in the United States did largely have to present that modelling for political reasons because he had downplayed the severity of the virus for so many weeks, not to mention the way he undermines journalism andreporting.
It was necessary for him to give that information to Americans for them to understand.
One of the things that stood out for me is highlighting the range is not as useful as pointing to what we're likely to face.
That suggests to me that even with the data they have which may not be complete, given they're relying on the provinces for it, that range exists.
What they are not willing to do is to put that forward because it doesn't sound to me like they have a lot of faith in the accuracy of it right now anyway because they're still trying to get that information from the provinces.



He seemed to spell that out when he spoke about the conversation with the premiers.
He said we want to make sure the data is aligned and we want more accurate models.
Obviously implicit in that is that the data doesn't go all theway.
He may be concerned about how people react.
The numbers that we saw come out of there dealing with their particular scenario, the Prime Minister didn't engage with thatquestion.
He went back to the idea that people want information and they want to know what's happening, but do they bring it back to this question of do people want to know what's going to happen and is your behaviour going to influence that.
One of the things that was interesting about personal protective equipment, he said going forward, not necessarily in the next few days or weeks, coming out of this he said he wants Canada to be self-sufficient when it comes tomaking that equipment, not only to supply the whole country, butperhaps to supply it to others, just some of the reflection the government is doing -- and not just this government, but governments around the world in terms of how prepared they are.



**Rosemary**:

If it repatriates economic opportunity and new industry out of a pandemic, you can see why that would be useful.
The promise I guess is there for more modelling and more analysis of the data.
As Vassy rightly points out, all those numbers are there.
I think one of the concerns that we have been reporting on is the accuracy of the raw data, particularly Ontario seems to be struggling to keep up and give full picture of what is happening.
We've heard from Canada's chief scientist that that is a concern as well.
All of those things to get a better picture of what is unfolding in Canada and in the weeks ahead.
Of course to note this is unprecedented and extraordinary.
It is difficult for all of us to wrap our heads around it too.
I'm going to leave both of My colleagues there for a moment as we wait for the press conference from cabinet ministers and public health officials and tell you that hospital unions in Ontario actually held a press conference while the Prime Minister was speaking and they are upset about a new Ontario policy.
The union says it Eng dangers some of their workers by excluding them from proper protection from the coronavirus.
Union officials call it cruel and unfair.
and the hospital union pointed out that there are a high proportion in Ontario who have tested positive for COVID-19 and they are healthcare workers.



There's a fear and desperation and a fair bit of anxiety and a feeling of abandonment.
97% of their members said they feel abandoned by the provincialgovernment.
87% of them report shortages of personal protective equipment.
In some long-term care facilities the equipment runs out in a day or two and we haven't even felt yet the full extent of this virus.
We're told that equipment is coming, but it never really arrives and there was a huge style, as you know, of this equipment, expired masks on the recommendation of the sars commission, 55 million masks were stockpiled.
Those masks were allowed to expire.
Many of them were destroyed.
We are asked that they be distributed.
The manufacturer says we can usethem and we would like them to be distributed.
We would like the government to take immediate action to direction industry to ramp-up production.
There is a lot of unused capacity in the Ontario sector that can be put to use.



**Rosemary**:

That is Michael Hurley from the hospitals union.
Obviously this conversation around shortage of personal protective equipment like masks and gowns, is a big concern for healthcare workers right now.
You heard from the Prime Minister that 10 million more masks have arrived over the lastdays.
Alan drummond is a doctor from Perth, Ontario.
Good to see you.



**Interview**:

Good day.



**Rosemary**:

One in 10 healthcare workers make up the COVID-19 cases inside this province.
Can you tell me about how you are feeling about how well-equipped you are when you go into work.



**Interview**:

Well, actually, I feel I'm actually prepared for the circumstances that are forthcoming.
We are being careful with our personal protective equipment.
Some would say rationing.
I don't think we're quite there yet, to be honest with you, in sense that our emergency departments are largely fairly quiet.
It's the qualm before the storm.
So the equipment that we have currently I think is adequate for the current circumstance.
If, however, this amounts to something significant in terms of the critical care load of the number of people that need incubation ventilation, then the question is do we have the number of n95.
It's a work-in-progress.
I think many parts in this country people are seeing a quietness and a calm and I thinkwe're okay.
Both most of the doctors and nurses are anxious about adequate protection equipment.
We hope that these promises materialize into cartons of stuff arriving at our doors.



**Rosemary**:

When you say you'renot quite at rationing things, where are you then, you're cautious when using equipment because you don't feel you have a stockpile in the hospital or describe to me where you think you're at.



**Interview**:

Right now the emergency departments are quiet and that's because people are getting the message about social distancing or there's panic and fear.
The volumes aren't there.
Yes, we are seeing COVID-19 patients even in My small town, but the number of people requiring critical care intervention is low.
Using precautions is adequate at this point.
But that's not to say we're not concerned.
We understand from our colleagues in both Italy and newyork city, that it's not a gentle ebb and flow.
Suddenly they appear on your door and you're overwhelmed.
We need to have some personal assurances that these aren't just promises, but they'll materialize in the coming days.



**Rosemary**:

What are your concerns around your town in Perth and the capacity if there was a surge? obviously it would be not just in your area, but if there was asurge, would you be -- would the hospital be prepared for it?



**Interview**:

Well, we have beenpreparing.
We've had some lead time seeing what happened in Italy and new York city.
I think a lot of emergency departments have taken that lead time and channelled that energy into positivity and preparedness.
We can't predict what is going to happen.
All we can say is we will do our best given the circumstances that present.
We are as prepared as we're going to be in terms of the emergency department setting.
In terms of would we be overwhelmed locally in Perth? the answer is absolutely yes.
We have one negative pressure one, one ventilator for a hospital of 50 people that serves a community of 20, 000.
I have a colleague who Jerry rigged some of the equipment to use as ventilators.
We're as prepared as we can be and we'll do our best.
If we're overwhelmed, we're overwhelmed.
All we can do is look after the patient in front of us on the stretcher, with one eye to what's happening in the waiting room and balance offload ramp and the other eye to greater societal demands and what the community will need.
It's part of the equation now.
It's not just the patient in front of us, but the greater community and their time of need.



**Rosemary**:

I only have 30 seconds, doctor, but are you worried about yourself? are you worried about going intowork? how concerned are you for your own well-being?



**Interview**:

So, I'm 66 and at a higher risk, but I'm not concerned.
I'm obviously careful and My wife reminds me constantly to wash My hands and all that, and I am. I'm doing all the right things.
I'm almost eating tofu, but the bottom line is it's My job, it'smy community.
We're going to serve and live up to the challenge.



**Rosemary**:

Doctor, so good to talk to you.
It's been such a pleasure getting to speak with so many medical professionals during all of this.
You are impressive human beings.
Good luck, doctor, and we will check in as things unfold.
That is Dr. Alan drummond who also needs to be reminded to wash his hands.
We are standing by for an update from the cabinet ministers and public health officials.
I'm rosemary Barton.
See you back here tomorrow.

**Rosemary**:

Welcome back.
I am rosemary Barton here in thenation's capital bringing you coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, how the federal government is responding and coping, trying to contain both the pandemic and some of the extraordinary measures that are being put in place to shore up the Canadian economy at the sametime.
We have just heard from the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, talking about more personal protective equipment that has arrived over the past 24 hours.
We have hit a milestone in this country now marking 10, 000 cases.
The Prime Minister set to speak with premiers later today about how well equipped their provinces are for what many believe will be a critical number of weeks ahead.
Let me show you more about what the Prime Minister said moments ago.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I know people are wondering when this will get better or how much worse it willbecome.
You want to see the numbers and predictions and look online for the latest and most credible data you can find.
You want to plan.
You want to prepare for the worst.
You want to know what to be hopeful about.
I know and we'll have more information for you soon, but the biggest variable shaping these projections is you and your behaviour.
You must listen to the world-class doctors who are already sharing the best available information and advice.
Ignoring them puts lives at risk.
It's up to you to do the right thing.
While many of you are staying home and limiting trips to the grocery store, too many aren't. What the experts are telling us is we must do everything we can today and tomorrow to set us on the right path for next week andnext month.
It takes time for the effects of our actions to be felt.
If we don't want our hospitals to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks, we need to make the rightchoices and we need to make themnow.



**Rosemary**:

That's the Prime Minister of Canada speaking to Canadians today about not only the promise of some more information to come.
There's a lot of raw data out there as we heard from the Prime Minister.
Certainly that is the case if you go on the coronavirus website, but it's analyzing thatinformation, what it means, what it might mean going forward for us that lots of people have questions about.
But the central message from the prime Minister, and I'm sure we will get it today from federal officials and cabinet ministers, is if you want to change the outcome of that data, the best advice is to do what they're telling you to do, stay home and limit your physical contact with other people.
My colleagues "power & politics" host Vassy kapelos and the cbc'scatharine Cullen joining me now.
Talking to these medical professionals, it's so -- you really -- I am very deeply impressed by them in terms of their fearlessness in the face of all of this.
It seems from that emergency room doctor in Perth that they sort of have enough for now, but what they would like to know is there will be enough or not when they get the influx in cases.



**Vassy**:

The Prime Minister announced that there have been 10 million masks that have arrived in the past few days and that they are being accounted for and validated and then they can be distributed.
This question of supply is such an important one as we head into period what public health officials have been telling us over the next few weeks there could be not a peak, but a surge in various parts of the country.
While we keep asking people we are talking to on the frontlines, do you have enough and do you think you have enough, the follow up is so dependant on what happens now, how we all observe those behaviours.
Sometimes it's difficult to assess and it also, as I said earlier, it really depends on which facility you're in and which province you live in. There are so many various accounts of it. The one thing I would highlighted from a federal level, it sounds like that will be a big part of the discussion with the various premiers tonight.
That call is expected to take place at 5:30 eastern between the Prime Minister and the premiers.
It is confusing from My perspective because the answer to whether we have enough has changed a bit over the last few days.
At first the Prime Minister said we have all current needs covered and for the foreseeable future.
For the foreseeable future, I don't know what that means.
Then we heard accounts from individual provinces, particularly quÉbec, and the premier said that they don't have enough and he's worried about the next three to seven days.
and then we were asking ministers how does that match up what you are saying.
Each province is calculating how bad it can get.
We are also hearing from nurses in long-term care facilities that they don't have what they need.
It is difficult to figure out from My perspective if there is enough.
Obviously there are efforts underway to secure more, but will more also be enough in the future.
Again, that depends on how things go now.
It's difficult to find a straightforward answer to that question, but today the Prime Minister acknowledged and yesterday the health Minister that maybe the stockpile the federal government has isn't going to be enough for provinces.
Then you compound that with all the competition around the worldeven south of the border for those supplies, it's not going to be easy.



**Rosemary**:

There may not be a straightforward answer for all of those factors.
Minister Anita anand, the Minister of procurement and public services, has tweeted that a plane carrying goods purchased from manufacturers in china arrived last night.
She said this helps fill orders for our fight against COVID-19. If the cases really start to take off in one region of the country and not another, you could probably move things around.
I imagine that part of the collaboration the prime minister is talking about that is also that, that premiers will step up if needed in certain places.



He was actually asked by one of our colleagues, rosemary, that if he's worried as this goes on provinces will be less willing to share.
The Prime Minister has put the emphasis on a collaborative attitude and going forward.
We did get that acknowledgement from patty hajdu that the stockpile is probably not what it should be. All governments are going to look at this situation, learning from it as it happens.
There are healthcare workers correspond about this.
The Prime Minister talking about the goal of making Canada self-sufficient when it comes tosupplying this protective equipment, something that they're working on. Something that they're putting alot of money into, trying to getother businesses to become involved in this too.
Our colleagues at radio-Canada reporting how fierce the competition is for this.
Noting that in one case the United States, according to whatthey're hearing actually bought a bunch of masks destined for france right off the tarmac, offering to pay three times the price.
That raised eyebrows.
The Prime Minister was asked about this issue and he talks about the importance of collaboration, although that's not always happening internationally.



**Rosemary**:

It's a competitive market for limited supplies and all that stuff.
As it comes in, it has to be verified by health Canada to make sure it's up to the standards we and want and explains why, in large part, as you pointed out that industry is trying to get online as quickly as possible to create some of this stuff in house so the competition aspect, the procurement aspect of this probably isn't needed as much.
I think we have about two minutes until cabinet ministers arrive here, so I think I will stick with that.
Yes, I will.
We are expecting an update from cabinet ministers and public health officials on the measures the federal government is takingtoday, the state of play in this country right now in fighting the pandemic.
After hearing from the Prime Minister, who is going to speak to provinces tonight at around 5:30 to get a handle on what the provinces are doing, what might be needed from that perspective.
I think we'll be hearing from the Minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Champagne, about repatriation efforts.
There are more and more flights scheduled from India, Pakistan, from countries around the world to try to get Canadians back.
That diplomatic and consular effort continues.
I believe he is there to give us an update too.
Here is the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland.



In our fight against the coronavirus.
Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
Stay strong and stay at home unless you are doing essential work like stocking the shelves of our grocery stores or working on the front lines of our healthcare system.
I know that we as Canadians are resilient.
Things are going to get worse before they get better, but I know that working together we are going to get through this.
 [voice of interpreter] this is a critical week in our fight against this virus.
Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
Stay strong and stay at home, unless you are doing essential work such as filling shelves at the grocery store or if you're providing healthcare.
Canadians are resilient.
We are going to get through this crisis together.
[end of translation] today we will hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa tam.
 [voice of interpreter] we'll hear from the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Champagne.
[end of translation] the Minister of indigenous services, Marc miller, patty hajdu, Dr. Tom Wong and the deputy health officer, Dr. Njoo.
Dr. Tam, please.



Good morning.
So as usual I'll start with an update on the numbers of COVID-19 cases in Canada.
There are now 10, 466 cases, including 111 deaths.
These represent infections from previous exposures and not what is happening right now necessarily.
So even if you're not hearing of cases in your community, that doesn't mean there is no risk ofexposure.
We must all consider that anyone could be infected and keeping our 2-metre distance is the safest step.
We continue to test at a very high rate in Canada, one of the highest in the world.
With tests completed for over 260, 000 people already.
Around 3.5% of these people have been confirmed as positive and 95% confirmed as negative.
So we talk about these percentages, what does it mean? Canada has been maintaining around a 3% to 4% positivity rate, which is in a good range for accurate detection of where the disease is circulating.
The W.H.O. Suggests somewhere between 3% to 12%. if we drop below this to 1%, it may mean we're casting our net too wide.
We're testing a lot of people that might not otherwise need testing.
People with mild illnesses in anarea of Canada where the diseaseis not circulating or you're testing too early yb sometimes the test is not 100% and people might need to be retested.
It shows that we have a highly sensitive testing system.
Of course we are continuing to increase our laboratory capacityto make sure that that is still the case.
So the number of cases and outbreaks connected to high-risksettings continue to be reported at a concerning rate, and in particular long-term care facilities are being infected inhigh numbers as well as reports of some hospital facilities withhealthcare workers impacted.
At least 50 deaths are related to long-term care facilities, senior residences, and other care facilities.
I cannot stress enough that we absolutely must double down to prevent the acceleration of spread in these settings, this means strict public health and infection policies to minimize arisk of introduction in these facilities.
It also means that every one of us must take all precautions.
For those not essential workers, this might mean staying away from long-term care facilities, while finding ways to keep in touch with loved ones, using virtual means like a phone call or video is not the same, but staying connected has never beenmore important.
 [voice of interpreter] once again, I must stress that this disease spares no one.
Each day as we get additional data, we are seeing that all agegroups with impacted.
The consequences of this illnesshas been severe and fatal in older and medically vulnerable Canadians, but adults under 40 years have also experienced severe illness, accounting for over 10% of hospitalizations with some reports of critical illness and at least one death.
[end of translation] the diseasespares no one.
Each day as we get additional data, we are seeing all age groups are impacted.
The consequences of this diseaseare more fatal in older and medically vulnerable Canadians.
But adults around 40 years of age are also at risk.
Many Canadians are using their innovation, creativity, and ingenuity to think outside the bubble and to plank the curve.
We need youtube users and tiktokusers to help us fight this at #stayhome.



[voice of interpreter] now I give the floor to the Minister of foreignaffairs, franÇois-philippe champagne.



Thank you.
We started two weeks repatriatedcanadians.
Myself and My counterparts in other governments have facilitated the return of thousands of Canadians on over 40 flights and from some 30 countries.
In coming days other flights will allow Canadians to return from Peru, Colombian, India, Pakistan, Poland, Cuba, trinidadand Tobago, and various African countries.
Canadians on board cruise ships and various locations also have been able to return to Canada.
Yesterday evening we received the good news that Canadians on board the zaandam would soon probably return home once the ship docks in Florida, which we hope will be later today according to the latest information that we receive.
[end of translation] I understand that Canadians returning home are all looking forward to being re United with their families and loved ones, but before they can do that, as the Minister of health has said many times and Dr. Tam, I want take this opportunity to remind them of their obligation to self-isolate for 14 days.
This is the law, full stop.
This is not the time to stop by the grocery store on the way home from the airport.
Our ability to overcome this pandemic depends on everyone behaving responsibly for their own health and safety, for the health and safety of their lovedones, their neighbours, and their communities.
In closing, I would like to say a word to Canadians who are still stranded abroad.
I understand fully your anxiety.
I read your messages.
I understand your desire to comehome.
We are working literally around-the-clock and doing everything we can to bring you home as quickly as possible, buti have to say to Canadians we are facing the most unprecedented challenge that we have ever faced in trying to bring people home, whether it's about airport closure, air-spaceclosure, border closures, restrictions in some countries, we are working around-the-clock to overcome these barriers to bring you home.
I must repeat something I've said before.
Unfortunately, despite our very best efforts, it will most likely not be possible to ensurethe return of all Canadians who wish to come home.
For those Canadians abroad who are watching us in the meantime, I want to say please continue tofollow the recommendations of local health authorities and take precautions to protect yourhealth and safety.
We will assist you in every way we can.
 [voice of interpreter] our country's response to this COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the best of what we are as Canadians.
The strength of our values, our sentiment, solidarity, and resilience in these exceptional circumstances.
Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.



Thank you very much.
[end of translation] we'll hear from the Minister of indigenous services, Marc miller.
Marc, please.



Good morning.
[end of translation] over the last week indigenous services Canada has sent out significant personal protection supplies is asking with urgency, we announced and are in the midst of transferring 305 million directly to indigenous communities across Canada and are continued to be focused on supporting the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.
 [voice of interpreter] with everything we've done to date, we are focusing on being flexible and rapid so people will get what they need and to meet their needs, notably by distributing food and giving material to those who are isolated or in quarantine.
School supplies for children, help for child care and essential workers.
[end of translation] to date there have been a total of 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in indigenous communities.
Communities are taking exceptional measures to prevent the spread of virus, including restricting travel in and out ofcommunities, self-isolation, andquarantine of returning travellers, and we will continueto adapt plans and provide surgecapacity as the situation evolves.
I will reiterate that hand washing and physical distancing remains the most effective ways to prevent and slow the onset ofcovid-19. I say all this in consciousness of the fact that there is a historical mistrust of government in a number of indigenous communities.
This is a gap that needs to be filled by indigenous leadership and they are filling it exceptionally well.
But it does provide -- it does create a barrier to getting thatimportant message out and as always indigenous leadership is stepping up and I want to acknowledge that.
During this pandemic many thingsmay arise.
We want to make sure that indigenous youth who reach the age of majority continue to receive the needs.
We will continue to cover the costs to first nations youth whowould have aged out of care, taking care of those most vulnerable.
Some provinces have undertaken this change already and I would encourage to do the same in support of vulnerable indigenousyouth.
 [voice of interpreter] we have also ordered first nations with coming elections not to hold them for the time being given the health risks associated withthese.
We're working with these communities for a temporary solution to meet their needs.
This will guarantee that there won't be any gaps in governance.
If they do decide to move ahead with elections, as is their right, we will be giving them instructions how to protect their communities.
[end of translation] challenges faced by inuit communities, including the essential access of air transportation.
We're working closely with inuitpartners, provinces and territories and the public health agency of Canada to ensure adequate preparedness, supplies and response levels in inuit communities.
We're exploring a number of options to provide essential airtransportation and ensure service continuity is provided.
Unfortunately COVID-19 is not the only challenges that indigenous communities may be facing in the coming weeks, but it can compound it. As we're heading into flood season, we are working with indigenous communities to help.
We are working on having solid flood mitigation measures in place, while preventing the spread of COVID-19. I want to reassure everyone thatwe will continue to support first nation, metis, and inuit int responding to natural disasters such as floods or fires, and we will work with regional health to make sure that first nations, metis, and inuit have supports needed during these times.
We have seen measures taken by indigenous communities to protect their population.
I want to acknowledge their workand the strength they have shown.
Let me be clear, this is just the beginning.
We know more support will be needed and we will be there to make sure no indigenous community is left behind.
Canada is here to support you during this uncertain time.
.



[voice of interpreter] now I'm giving the floor to the president of the pressure board, Mr. Duclos.



Thank you.
Let's be clear, the coming week swill be determinant.
It's not just enough to say # everythingwillbefine, we're calling on citizens to follow public health guidelines and this will allow us to protect our self as well as those who are protecting us, namely, all those in the healthcare system who Arron the front lines and working hard.
After the key announcement yesterday about emergency wage subsidy that the Canadian government will be giving, I would like to ensure all sectors of the economy, notably the agricultural sector, that all companies and organizations receiving funding are eligible for the wage subsidy.
[end of translation] I would like to add following the important announcement on the Canada emergency wage subsidy, would add for the attention of all sectors, in particular for the attention of the cultural sector, that all businesses and organizations that are receiving public funds are eligible to thecanada emergency wage subsidy.



[voice of interpreter] thank you.
Now we will be ready to answer questions.
[end of translation].



We will take three questions on the phone and return to the phone, one question and one follow up.
