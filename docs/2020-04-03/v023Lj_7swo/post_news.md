**Rosemary**:

All right.
We're going to turn away from this federal briefingtoday, where the focus was largely on personal protective equipment.
The health minister reporting that tens of millions of masks have come into the country over the past number of days, and they will now be shipped out to provinces as needed.
and, so, let us turn toquebec, which is dealing with the highest number of cases in this country for their daily briefing.
I'm rosemary Barton, andi'm signing off and mycolleague, Andrew Nichols, will pick up. 



**Premier:[Speaking throughinterpreter]IT REMAINS THERE AREPEOPLE WHO ARE NOTRESPECTING THE GUIDELINES. THERE ARE PEOPLEGATHERING, LESS THAN TWOMETRES AWAY, AND THERE AREBUSINESSES THAT DO NOTOFFER ESSENTIAL SERVICESAND PRODUCTS THATCONTINUE. AND AT SOME POINT, WE HAVETO PUT ALL OF THE CHANCESON OUR SIDE TO REDUCE THESPREAD OF THE VIRUS. SO TODAY -- TODAY I HAVESENT, AND I AM SENDING AMESSAGE, TO THE POLICEOFFICERS OF THE SÛRETÉdu QUÉBEC, AS WELL AS THEPOLICE DEPARTMENTS OF THEGREATER CITIES, TO BE LESSTOLERANT. I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW WECAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THATTHERE ARE PEOPLE WHERE AVAST MAJORITY ARE MAKINGGREAT EFFORTS, AND THATTHESE EFFORTS BE BANISHEDBY THE ACTIONS OF A FEWWHO DON'T TAKE ITSERIOUSLY. SO POLICE OFFICERS WILL BEHANDING OUT MORE FINES, AND I REPEAT THAT THEYVARY BETWEEN $1,000 TO$6,000 PER PERSON. SO I THINK THAT THAT ISWHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARENOT RESPECTING THEGUIDELINES SHOULD HAVE. SO I'M ASKING THE MAYORSOF THE GREATER CITIES, ASWELL, TO MAKE SURE THATTHE POLICE OFFICERS HAVETHOSE GUIDELINESRESPECTED. THIS IS SERIOUS. THERE ARE LIVES BEINGENDANGERED. AND IF WE CONTINUE SEEINGGATHERINGS AND COMPANIESTHAT ARE STILL OPEN WHENTHEY'RE NOT ESSENTIAL, THERE WILL BE LIVES ANDTHERE WILL BE DEATHS. SO IT IS VERY SERIOUS. AND THOSE DEATHS, WE DON'TKNOW, IT COULD BE YOURGRANDMOTHER, IT COULD BEYOUR BROTHER. SO PLEASE, LET'S SHOW ABIT MORE SOLIDARITY. MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. LET'S BE LESS TOLERANT. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEENDENUNCIATIONS, I THINKTHERE WERE 7,000 TO THEPOLICE OFFICERS, WHILE THEPEOPLE WHO SEE THAT THEGUIDELINES ARE NOT BEINGRESPECTED, I THINK THAT'SWHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. NOW, THE NUMBERS OF THEDAY. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVETHREE NEW DEATHS, SO WE'RENOW AT 36. AND I OFFER MY SINCERESTCONDOLENCES TO THEFAMILIES AND LOVED ONE OFTHOSE THREE NEW VICTIMS. WE NOW HAVE 5,518 CASES, AN INCREASE OF 907. 365 PEOPLE BEINGHOSPITALIZED, AND THAT ISAN INCREASE OF 58. AND WE NOW HAVE 96% ININTENSIVE CARE. AN INCREASE OF 14. AS YOU SEE, THE NUMBER OFCASES IS INCREASING. BUT IF WE COMPAREOURSELVES, IF WE LOOK ATTHE DEATH RATE, BECAUSETHAT IS, AT THE END OF THEDAY, ONE OF IT'S THINGSTHAT IS IMPORTANT, LIMITING THE DEATHS. OF COURSE ONE DEATH IS ONETOO MANY. BUT WHEN WE LOOK INPERCENTAGE OF THEPOPULATION, WE HAVE FEWERDEATHS, MUCH FEWER DEATHS, IN QUEBEC THAN THE UNITEDSTATES OR ANY COUNTRY INEUROPE. SO IT HAS TO STAY THATWAY. BUT IN ORDER FOR IT TOSTAY THAT WAY, EVERYBODYHAS TO FOLLOW THEGUIDELINES. ALSO WHAT I WISH TO TELLYOU IS THAT OUR HEALTHNETWORK IS READY. I WAS TELLING YOUYESTERDAY, WE HAVE BEDS, ALOT OF BEDS. UNLIKE OTHER STATES IN THEWORLD. AND ALSO WHAT ISIMPORTANT, AND WE MADE AFULL EXERCISE OF THIS, YOUKNOW THOSE VENTILATORSTHAT WE KEEP TALKINGABOUT, WE HAVE ENOUGH INWHAT THE PREDICTIONS ARE, AS FAR AS THE PEAK ISCONCERNED, AND THERE ISNOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THEWORLD THAT CAN SAY THAT, THAT WE HAVE ENOUGHVENTILATORS, SO THAT IS AHUGE ADVANTAGE. NOW, AS FAR AS THEINDIVIDUAL PROTECTIVEEQUIPMENT IS CONCERNED, THE MASKS, THE GLOVES, THEGOWNS, WE RECEIVED A FEWORDERS. IT IS TRUE THAT IT ISARRIVING BIT BY BIT. WE'RE STILL AT ABOUT AWEEK'S WORTH OF INVENTORY, AND IT IS CONTINUING TOARRIVE IN THE NEXT FEWDAYS. IT IS POSSIBLE THATESTABLISHMENTS SAY I DON'THAVE ENOUGH FOR SEVENDAYS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ISEVERY DAY IT HAPPENS THATWE TAKE EQUIPMENT THAT ISIN ONE ESTABLISHMENT THATHAS MORE THAN SEVEN DAYSWORTH, AND TO SEND IT TOANOTHER ESTABLISHMENT THATHAS FEWER THAN SEVEN DAYSWORTH. SO LET'S BE PRUDENT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERYESTABLISHMENT HAS SEVENDAYS' WORTH, BUT IN TOTALIN QUEBEC, WE HAVE ENOUGHFOR SEVEN DAYS. I SAW SOME NEWS, AND IT ISTRUE THAT IN CERTAINCOUNTRIES THINGS ARE, YOUKNOW -- THEY'RE ROUGH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO NAMETHEM. BUT WE ARE ALSO PLAYINGALONG WITH THE RULES OFTHE GAME, WHICH MEANS THATSOMETIMES WE HAVE TO HAVECASH, WE HAVE TO HAVEPOLICE OFFICERS, WE HAVETO HAVE PEOPLE FOLLOWINGTHE ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION. BUT DON'T WORRY, WE AREDOING EVERYTHING THAT CANBE DONE SO THAT THE ORDERSTHAT WE ARE ORDERING MAKEIT TO OUR HOSPITALS HEREIN QUEBEC. MY DAILY THANKS TO ALL OFTHE HEALTH CARE STAFF. AND PERHAPS WE HAVEN'TSAID IT OFTEN, BUT I ALSOWANT TO WISH -- I ALSOWANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUTTHE STAFF THAT IS WORKINGWITH DR. RUTA AT PUBLICHEALTH. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OFSCIENTISTS, AND I THINKTHIS IS A GREAT ADVANTAGETHAT WE HAVE IN QUEBEC, WEHAVE SCIENTISTS WHO EVERYDAY COMMIT RECOMMENDATIONSTO US, AND I WISH TOREALLY THANK THEM BECAUSETHEY WORK NIGHT AND DAY. AND, OF COURSE, THERE ISTHE STAFF THAT WORKS WITHA SENSE OF DUTY AND WITHHUMANITY. AND I WISH TO THANK THEM. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEEDMORE THAN JUST THANKINGPEOPLE. WE ALSO NEED CONCRETEACTIONS. AND THIS AFTERNOON THEPRESIDENT OF THE BOARD ANDTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AREGOING TO BE ANNOUNCING ANIMPROVEMENT TO THE WAGES. WE'RE TALKING A TOTAL ANDAN AMOUNT THAT IS GOING TOBE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT, $297 MILLION. AND THAT IS GOING TOIMPROVE THE WAGES OF THOSEWHO ARE IN DIRECT CONTACTWITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ILL. AND, AS WELL, BECAUSE ITHINK THAT IS WHERE THEREIS THE MOST WORK TO BEDONE. THE ATTENDANTS IN PRIVATERESIDENCES AND HOMES, IT'SBEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT. THEY HAVE A VERY LOWSALARY. WE WILL BE INCREASING IT, BUT BY $4 AN HOUR. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEWORKERS OF THOSE HOMES INTHE PRIVATE SECTOR BEPAID. AND I THINK THAT WHEN WELOOK AT ALL OF THESEIMPROVEMENTS AND THESEINCREASES, I'VE NEVER SEENA GROUP THAT DESERVES ANINCREASE IN WAGES AS MUCHAS THESE PEOPLE. SO THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCEDTHIS AFTERNOON WITH MOREDETAIL. AND I WILL END WITH MYTHREE PRIORITIES, MORETHAN EVER**:

Don't go out unless it is absolutelynecessary.
Don't go out.
I don't want us to empty the grocery stores, but if you can go less often todo the groceries, that's Good idea.
and when you do go out, even when you go to thegroceries, even when you go for a walk, always keep two metres and don'tgather up in parks.
and when you come back, you wash your handscorrectly, with soap.
So I'm convinced if everybody -- and I repeat, absolutely everybody -- if everybody respects theguidelines, we will save hundreds of lives inquebec.
and let's look at thestatistics, such as theyare.
I'm proud to see that inquebec we have fewer deaths per million people.
Than in new York, than in the United States.
and that's how we want to keep it. Thank you, everyone.

**Premier**:

Today'snumbers shows us an important increase incases, but our health network is ready to faceit.
The most important thing is to follow the public health directives.
If someone still though tit wasn't serious, it is time to wake up. Non-essential businessesmust close and gatheringsmust stop.
If they don't, please willdistribute fines and forcepeople who isolation.
It's a question of life ordeath.
So everybody must continueto follow our threepriorities: don't go outunless it is necessary.
If you do go out, keepyour distances.
and when you come backhome, wash your hands.
It is quite simple.
If everybody followedthose rules, we will savelives.
and I will thank you all.
