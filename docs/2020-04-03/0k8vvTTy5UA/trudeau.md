**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

This is how we'll protect Canadians and the economy and it is also a lot to take in. People are having to figure out how they can work from home or close up shop temporarily.
Partners are trying to explain to their kids what's going on and why school is canceled.
Right now, the last thing anyone needs is to be worrying about how to make ends meet.
People need to know they have support for their jobs, their businesses, their industries and that is what our government has been focused on since day one.
Yesterday we announced an $82 billion plan that will support all Canadians.
This includes a whole range of measures.
and people should be checking Canada.
Ca for the latest information.
Our team is hard at work with the public service and making sure these new supports get to Canadians as quickly as possible.
They are doing a fantastic job already and I'll have a long discussion with the clerk of the privy council later today to talk about how we can support our public servant and ensure that Canadians can access these new programmes.
The bottom line is this -- we're giving you more help when you need it. If you are a parent, we're here for you.
Just like for the single mom of two who will get nearly $1500 by the end of may because of the increase in the Canada child benefit and the g. S.t. Credit.
If you're worried about making ends meet, we've got your back.
Just like for the family that was concerned about their mortgage and now doesn't have to make payments for the next six months.
and if you are helping others, we're standing with you.
Like with the samaritan house in brandon, Manitoba that, on Wednesday, was able to open and deal with COVID-19. Thanks to new funding.
They were worried because their clients had nowhere to go since everything else closed.
But now, with the new support, they can stagger entry to 10 people at a time, extend hours and stock up the food bank.




**Interpreter**:

We're going through a difficult time, but we will go through this together.
WHO you need more time to pay back a student loan or whether you're a farmer who's worried about his income, we are there for you.
and we will continue to do everything we can to help you.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We're continuing to pull out all the stops to keep you safe.
We're moving forward on vital research for everything from better understanding how this virus spreads to developing vaccines and treatments.
As par of the $1 billion fund I announced earlier this month, $25 million will directly support 49 researchers and their teams across the country.
Their work is focused on developing and implementing measures to detect, manage and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Across the country, scientists and researchers are working extremely hard.
I want to take a moment to specifically thank them for all the essential work they're doing.
At the same time, we will expedite access to COVID-19 lab test kits and other medical devices.
The reality is that the need for these test kits is growing.
Yesterday Dr. Tam said that officials have now tested more than 50, 000 Canadians since the beginning of the outbreak.
25, 000 of those were done just in the last week alone.
So while we ramp up, we're making sure Canada is ready to keep up. Ministers hajdu and ministers Freeland will continue to work with the provinces and territories so that everyone has the resources they need.
In times of crisis, Canadians come together.
We've heard from businesses from coast to coast to coast who are telling us they want to help.
Soon I'll have more to say about procurement and how industry can help with this effort.
But until then, I want to let people know that we're working tirelessly to keep our hospitals, health care system and Canadians supported.
On that note, let me take a moment to recognize, again, the incredible work of our nurses, doctors, technicians and other health care professionals.
They are on the front lines of this and they're doing a remarkable job.
We need to support them and keep them healthy as well.
But even if you don't work in amend ho, you can still keep people healthy.
For example, we still need blood donors.
So if you are able, consider going in and donating.
Book an appointment online through blood.
Ca or by calling 888-236-6283.




**Interpreter**:

We still need blood donors.
If you are able to make a donation, we encourage you to do so. To make an appointment, you can look at the site or call 888-236-6283.
We are also looking for other ways to help Canadians abroad.
Earlier, I spoke with president zelensky of the Ukraine to talk about how we can co-ordinate our work.
Now earlier this week we announced a new fund to help people to receive up to $5, 000 to return to the country or meet their needs in the meantime.
We are also working with businesses and telecommunications organisations.
They have agreed to send a text message to Canadians abroad about the consular services available.
Ministers Bains and champagne are working with their partners to put this in place and we'll continue to ensure that people receive all the necessary information.
There is a lot of misinformation circulating and we want to ensure that people know how to obtain help.
I want to remind you that Canadians can come back to Canada and that they should do that.
All of those having trouble coming back, I'm telling you we can work hard to resolve that situation.
Westjet and air Canada talked about this very situation yesterday afternoon.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There is no doubt these are uncertain times.
But no matter what happens next, we can count on each other.
So keep supporting your neighbours by picking up some groceries for them if you are already at the store.
Check in with people on the front lines, like cashiers and truckers, pharmacists and hospital staff.
Take the right steps, like staying home and working remotely to help flatten the curve and, as you do, know that your government is right there with you.
We're working to slow the spread of this virus.
We're taking steps to support you through tough times.
There is nothing we won't do to keep you safe and to protect your health.
Thank you.
Merci.
I'm now happy to take your questions.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Yesterday premier Kenny in Alberta estimated that it won't be until may or June that social distancing measures will be lifted.
How long do you think social distancing and having people work from home will be in place for?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We'll continue to follow the best recommendations of experts.
We've heard anything from weeks to months.
We know this is a difficult and extraordinary time in which Canadians are taking difficult and extraordinary measures and we will continue to do that until Canadians are safe.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Two questions -- border closures between the United States and Canada.
Do you know exactly when that will come into effect? this will go on longer before it stops.
So, what is the worst possible scenario? first of all, with respect to the United States-Canada border, we are working together to try to finalize the details with our american counterparts.
and we expect these measures to go into effect probably in the night of Friday to Saturday.
So in a day and a half.
Now with rm to the various scenarios out there, we are aware of a variety of possible scenarios and what we're doing with respect to the social distancing and closing shops, we believe all of this will keep Canadians safer and we will continue to be ready for any eventuality.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada and the United States.
I think it is almost there.
My understand is that the measures will probably come into place in the night between Friday and Saturday.
So in about a day and a half.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, president Donald trump yesterday signed the defence production act which would allow the United States military to help in the development of personal protective equipment such as masks and the Italian military is also helping to produce ventilators.
Canada has its own defence production act with similar powers.
So, are you considering using them and under what kind of circumstances?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Yes, we are considering using any measures necessary to ensure that Canadians and our health care systems have the supports they need.
We've already been engaged with industry on production and ramping up capacity to build and create more equipment.
We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well.
There is a range of things that we can do. We'll do what is necessary.




**Caller**:

Yes, we are looking at all the possible measures that could be necessary to ensure that the equipment people need is available.
We have already talked to many different manufacturers about the needs of our health care system and what they can do to help.
But we will also be looking at other sing options and that could include the military's participation.
Mr. Trudeau, with respect to the air lifts decided on by Mr. Champagne, do you think that there is certain countries that are determined on a priority basis and will you repatriate the people on the ship in Marseilles? well, we are receiving an enormous number of requests from all around the world.
Canadians did receive a text message, Canadians abroad did receive that message, which told them who to contact if they need assistance.
As I said, I talked to the c. E.o. S of westjet and air Canada last night and we pointed out to them that we need to work together to try to repatriate as many Canadians as possible on an emergency basis.
With respect to the cruise ship, I have no information at this time.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we said, we're going to work very, very hard to bring Canadians home.
It is time for Canadians to come home from around the world.
We recognize that will be a challenge.
That is why we sent out a text message to all Canadians overseas with information on how to share their information and get in touch with consular services.
I spoke yesterday with the heads of our two large airlines at west jet and air Canada to talk about how we can work with them to ensure that there are flights to bring Canadians home.
We'll continue to respond to the overwhelming demand by Canadians for support.
We will be there to help them and get home as many people as we possibly can in the coming days and weeks.
On the cruise ship in question, I don't have any specific information on that, but I'm sure there will be further updates at noon on the regular press conference.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
What is your thinking of using the emergency measures act and would that work? would you need the approval of the provinces or of parliament? and this is an option in terms of restricting movements between the provinces.
As I said, we will be looking at everything that can be done.
We are not ruling everything out in terms of the options that we may want to rely on. At the same time, we do recognize that the emergency measures act is an extreme law with certain implications that would also require us to bring back the house of commons to pass these measures.
It is a major tool and I can tell you right now we already have a lot of tools that allow us to do what we need to do. It is our other steps that need to be accomplished and can only be accomplished through invoking the emergency measures act.
Then we will do so.



**Reporter**:

Yesterday you mentioned $305 million that would go to indigenous communities to help with this pandemic.
You mentioned the distinctions-based approach.
Can you explain what that means for first nations, status/nonstatus inuit and mÉtis first nations?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We'll be sending money to indigenous communities for them to use the way they need to to keep their communities safe through COVID-19. and support access to supplies they need and get through this difficult situation.
We recognize that indigenous Canadians are faced with greater health and economic challenges that most Canadians, at the best of times.
There is a need for special report and special care for indigenous communities and indigenous across the country.
There will be a press conference later to discuss what we're doing with indigenous Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Thank you, Prime Minister.
On small business, small businesses who have had to shut their doors already and have zero revenue coming in say that the help that was promised yesterday won't help them if it doesn't get there in time before they go bankrupt.
What about immediate payroll support?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have made credit a lot easier to access for businesses of all sizes right now.
Those were moves we made last week to ensure that there are loans and financing available for businesses large and small.
We've also taken specific measures on payroll support for small businesses that will be available in the near future.
The help for Canadians will be flowing in the coming weeks.
We recognize that this is a difficult time both in terms of getting these new programmes in place quickly and a enough to help Canadians and that is why I'm going to be working with the public service to ensure that all of our efforts are focused on supporting Canadians through this difficult time.




**Interpreter**:

We recognize that small businesses are facing special challenges and that is why we announced measures yesterday to help them.
At the same time, we had announced access after credit last week, a credit facility to help those businesses going through tough times.
and also help for Canadians that need sources of revenue.
Those sources of revenue will be coming in the coming weeks and we're doing everything we can to get this done as quickly as possible.
Obviously we're introducing new problems in government and that is why we're working with the public service in order to deliver.



Thank you.
We'll go to the phone for a few questions.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
That was certainly the strategy behind it. I would agree that the news out of this today is that he expects it to come into force overnight, Friday night.
I would note that from the information I had yesterday, they almost expected the ts to be crossed and the is dotted by last night.
So, I am curious to find out exactly what specific details still require agreement on because the deal isn't essentially, formally I guess, signed at this point or agreed to. But I do anticipate it to come in. That is significant.
a couple of other things that I picked up on and will start with the end of the press conference.
and that was the message to Canadians abroad.
Again, just thinking to the kinds of communication that I've been receiving from Canadians.
Every time I put out that message, it is time to come home which comes, of course, from the Prime Minister, from the various ministers.
The response is often it's not that easy and that they are really having a difficult time being able to secure that transportation.
I thought it was interesting that the Prime Minister said, look, we're not going to make any judgments.
That is speaking directly to people who left in the middle of stuff that was unfolding.
He said we'll be there for you and he also said that they are in conversations with airlines to try and secure more flights back to this country.
I know and I think that that is information that Canadians are really hungry for right now.
There are a lot of nervous Canadians kind of around the world thinking Ok. I get this message, but I'm having a really hard time booking a flight or finding the means to get home.
So I think that part was significant as well.
and finally I thought he was a bit more specific when it comes to using the emergencies act and a little bit more -- less reticent to say that he would employ it. Again, I'm curious as to the specific means for doing so or exactly how they would target that.
But it may come into play when the house is called back and he was laying the groundwork for Canadians to be ready for the possibility of that.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
If it's needed, I guessful David, you reported yesterday about the cell phone messages that went out to Canadians.
We can show people really unusual and new measures that the government took.



**Reporter**:

You talk about a whole of government response, this is a whole of country response.
Reaching out to key player in the telecommunications sector to reach out to Canadians to not only get this information to them, but try to help them quantify exactly how many Canadians are out of the country, where they might be. and how many want to come home.
and we wanted to make sure we all did stories on this because there are all these scams going on. E-mail and on text messages and they really want Canadians abroad to know that, look, the government of Canada is legitimately trying to reach you to either help you get the money you need to get home or help you get the means you need to shelter in place.
If you know someone abroad, tell them to expect these specific meseneding as from the government of Canada.
To help you get home.
and rosey, in terms of what happened today, the Prime Minister is tlm prime comforter the way he was the prime consoler after the iranians shot down the canadian airline.
Telling Canadians we'll give you money and help you keep your home.
If you are abroad, we'll try to get you home and we're also going to support your local hospital to deal with this, like accelerating procurement measures which we may get an announcement on that tomorrow, I understand.
and working with industries and businesses across the country to retool their production facilities to maybe do things like manufacture new vent lays toer and much needed medical equipment.
The one other bit of news, I think, if we're looking at that beyond the messaging of keep your distance, stay home, work from home, is that seniors who are getting hammered by these daily stock market meltdowns, people on a fixed income, relying on a retirement savings, he says there will be measures coming to help you there.
I think what we've seen in the what is now over $93 billion that they spent in a week, just think about that.
$93 billion in a week responding to this is that there is a series of more things to come as the ripples of this go through the economy and through society and as they see exactly what the need is going to be. They didn't want to roll everything out all at once.
So reassurance is really the theme of the day.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.
I thought his one line there in the middle of the press conference.
He said there is nothing we won't do to keep you safe.
You know, obviously an important message for people right now.
I do think that there are some bits left over from yesterday's announcement that people are still unclear about.
We talked about repatriating Canadians.
Good to know that he's had a couple of conversations with airline companies to see how air Canada, west jet and others might be able to help.
Our colleague j. P. task er has a great story today about Canadians sort of stranded in all sorts of places.
Some countries they simply can't get out of because they are on lockdown, like Peru, for instance.
There is also the component of the money, how quickly people need the money and how quickly they get the money.
Let's get both of you to weigh in on what we understand around that.
I'll start with you, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

My understanding is, and we had Minister Blair on. I know heather had Minister morneau on to talk about this last night.
I think that what their messaging is right now, especially for the big chunk of change that they made available for people who are not normally covered by e. I. and we have certainly heard a lot from those Canadians.
You have to take sick days and your employer doesn't cover it. There is money that you could access and it will be done through basically the e. I. system but it is going to take time to get you that money.
and they're estimating probably at least three weeks.
Two to three weeks.
Could be April before you see it. There is concern from Canadians about the need for money sooner than that.
The Minister so far who I've heard from, at least on the record, this is why they wanted it done.
The other concern I heard a lot of is the technical capacity to get this money out the door.
I remember doing a story years ago about e. I., you know, normally.
You're on hold for a long time.
It is not easy.
Here even the sort of clarification is around what you have to prove.
How do you show that you have to stay home with your kid.
I know that's all being developed.
But that is a very sort of procedurally heavy way of going about things.
and so it is going to take time.
I just wonder, they have assured us that the technical capacity is there, but those questions are genuine.
Will all that money be able to get out the door, even in three weeks, and three weeks for people worried about paying rent on the 1st, you know, it's a bit nerve racking.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
That is absolutely fair.
The Prime Minister mentioned if you have a mortgage payment, at the very least, you are able to defer your mortgage payment and you can do that for the next six months.
a couple of points around the capacity.
I do think that -- first of all, around recalling parliament.
Bill morneau told heather his cox this morning that it is possible that they could get a quorum of M.P.s in place in ottawa by this weekend, even so they can pass the legislation because most of those changes do require that.
and they mentioned the capacity to actually do this.
I think we know that governments on a good day get overwhelmed.
Their I. T. systems get overwhelmed.
We're seeing things like telehealth, for instance.
People having to add a lot more people and phone line capacity.
I'm sure that is a legitimate concern.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
The telehealth systems in Ontario and other provinces will be overwhelmed by the surge of what is happening in a pandemic situation like this.
The more fundamentalist at the federal government level is look at the phoenix payroll system.
If you are a public servant in Canada, you have been fighting a battle with your own employer to get the money that you are owed for quite some time now.
So the issue with this, just to walk you through it, it's important to look at the totality of the measures, rather than break it down to a single piece.
So, yes.
It is going to take two to three weeks to ramp up through parliamentary approvals and through building the I. T. systems before money starts coming in. But the agreement from the banks to play nice with everybody in Canada, to stop taking money out, takes some of that pressure off.
You have to look at these initial measures as almost like battlefield medicine or emergency room medicine.
There are longer systemic problems in the economy that are going to come from this and the personal, economic well-being coming from this that will take a longer period of time.
But within two to three weeks, the two new programmes they announced yesterday should come online.
The emergency care benefit, which is for people who get sick or have to self-isolate or look after a sick family member or elderly family member or child with all the schools and daycares closed, that is going to be relatively simple.
You can enroll online and say yes, this applis to me. You don't have to prove it and they will start giving you money.
The emergency support benefit, which is essentially e. I. for everyone, whether you qualify for e. I. or not, we don't know the mechanics of that yet and how that is going to work, whether you have to prove income or employment loss, but this is putting a financial floor under people who lose their jobs and didn't have enough hours to qualify for e. I. or might be self-employed or might be a small business owner or independent contractor who can't work because of all of this.
They will be able to avail of the equivalent of employment insurance.
How you sign up for that and how you get it, we don't quite know and the two other measures, a boost to the g. S.t. Credit being a low and modest income earners that.
Will come in May and that is a simple spiking of the amounts that you send out when those cheques are delivered and there is a boost coming to the Canada child benefit and that will likely come in May as well.



**Rosemary**:

I should say.
Interesting that they're not going to require proof for that.
That first measure.
and I do remember morneau yesterday saying -- bill morneau saying yesterday that there was some capacity within the revenue agency itself and he was talking to his colleagues so maybe there is a way through tax returns filed in the last year, just being if you are self-employed to get you access through that.
I'm speculating here.



**Reporter**:

On the emergency care benefit, imagine if you suddenly said to everybody who needs it, go get a doctor's note.
[laughter]that would be ridiculous.



**Rosemary**:

For sure.
For sure.
Ok. So if you are tuning in now to CBC television or CBC news network, CBC gem or online around the world, the latest update we have from the Prime Minister on his fourth press conference in the past four days is basically that they are working hard, first of all, to try to repatriate Canadians who are stuck overseas.
and they have been in contact with air companies, airline carriers to see if they can help them in that move.
The Prime Minister making it clear that the government's not judging anyone who may have left in the midst of this and is now stuck somewhere else.
and also a key part of announcement yesterday, we learned a little bit more from the Prime Minister today and that is that those new measures at the Canada-United States border will go into effect likely overnight on Friday.
So that is going to be a quick turn-around.
This will start to have an impact immediately and that is the ambassador bridge between windsor and detroit.
Those border restrictions, of course, limited to nonessential travel.
and no going across to detroit to get a special kind of chips that you are interested in. All of that is over.
There will be some allowance for that to continue.
Our windsor host, chris ensing, has been through the week as well bringing us lots of good perspective from that part of the country, chris.
Good now that we have a sense of the timeline here.
That allows people to prepare in some ways.
How are people feeling about the fact that nonessential travel is no longer going to be possible and do they understand exactly what that means for them?



**Reporter**:

For a bit, no, to be honest.
We were having calls into our newsroom and e-mails of wondering when exactly this all takes place.
I was still taking calls from people when these measures of just United States citizens were crossing back and forth wondering if they could drive out on their vacation because they couldn't fly out anymore.
So this is, again a reiteration of how important that border measure is and the self-isolation of coming back and if you come back from international travel for 14 days and the idea of avoiding the nonessential travel.
That clarification of it being closed to everyone except for essential industries was pretty big for that to come through and get the full understanding.
I think we'll give some reassurances of when it is happening.
The other big thing we've been getting calls and questions about is can I come back into Canada if I'm in the United States and I'm trying to get home from a vacation or a travel.
Again, the Prime Minister saying that Canadians will be welcomed back into Canada, but told once again to isolate for 14 days once they get back to their hometown.
Those are real key points that we were looking at locally to try to get some more guidance on as we let people know what they can and can't do, our local health unit as well.
I was interesting to hear him address that specifically today and it is certainly going to ease some minds here about what you can and cannot do during a time when the situation keeps changing.



**Rosemary**:

I should remind people that overnight, the new measures at the arrivele as for airports has changed so that overnight if you tried to get on to an airplane, you were overseas and you showed symptoms of the virus, you're no longer allowed to get on the airplane.
However, if you present like where you are at a land border with symptoms, that is perfectly fine.
You will be allowed in and told to self-isolate as you mentioned.
I guess one of things we're still asking is if there's still lots of essential travel happening between the border, across the border, rather, to make sure that goods and services continue.
What kind of measures willable in place for truck drivers, for instance, to make sure that they are not bringing the virus in with them? and I'm not sure they have the answers to that either.



**Reporter**:

I have a perspective.



**Rosemary**:

Good, good.
[laughter]



**Reporter**:

I spoke with holly noble -- I know.
We're getting the idea of what it is like right now at least.
She is a 28-year-old truck driver.
She works in the auto industry and bringing parts from windsor to detroit every single day.
She criss-crosses that border multiple times.
14-hour days.
Honestly her life sounds exhausting right now.
and what she said when she crosses into the border is she is getting asked different questions, they're handing her different forms.
But her office, her work from home, if you will, is that truck.
It's the only one she is inside and no one else is inside of it either.
So she's got gloves on. She saw border agents who routinely have gloves on anyway so she is feeling comfortable with the precautions in place.
That is one truck driver of the 8, 000 and 9, 000 trips that go back and forth but gives us an idea of what life is like in a cab right now.
So she is continuing to see the essential service going back and forth.
and then the other big part of this as well, rosey, talking about this yesterday, the frontline health care workers that live in windsor and work in detroit.
I spoke with someone at henry ford hospital who told me that effectively the detroit hospitals couldn't run effectively without the frontline health care professionals who live in Canada and work in detroit.
So, keeping that open for essential services is really key.
We know about 6500 people live in windsor-essex and work in detroit or the michigan area every single day and 2, 000 of them are people who work in the health care industry.
We've heard from some of them that are going into that work from home model, though, because they are not necessarily working interactively with patients but doing something on the secondary side so they're able to stay safe in their isolated home office that they have.
But the frontline people, the nurses, we're being told once again allowed to cross into the United States to make sure that they're able to provide that during a time when that is going to help the crisis, the pandemic that we're all living through.



**Rosemary**:

Lots of good perspective there.
I'll end on this.
We have the live shot of the ambassador bridge on the other par of the screen.
It looks fairly busy.
What will it look like Saturday, come Saturday or Sunday? will we still see the same amount of traffic, given that goods will still be going back and forth?



**Reporter**:

One of things we're expecting is to sleep a slight dip in the amount of transport trucks that go back and forth because of what happened at the autoplants.
The g. M., f. C.a. and ford have announced that they temporarily suspended production.
When that happens, there is a trickle effect.
There is 40, 000 people according uniforwho work on those assembly lines in Canada.
If they are not building as many cars, they don't need as many parts.
and those trips back and forth might ease off.
So, they're anticipate Ing that they could see that kind of change.
But Canada wants to protect the food supply injury in. Windsor-essex, we have a huge greenhouse industry as well and making sure those avenues are open for that type of trade.
It will be key here and we heard that with henry ford workers that they will be allowed to come into Canada following self-isolations when they arrive and making sure that they have been screened for symptoms and COVID-19 before traveling into Canada.
There is more details about that on our website.
But it is really the key points of making sure that supply chains stay alive and in a place like windsor-essex, I can't imagine how much -- how many jobs or families haven't been impacted by that border closure here in our community.
That is how big of a role it plays.



**Rosemary**:

and, of course, this is a community that feel this is on a daily basis but other community like this across the country.
You have been so helpful over the past number of days.
Let me go to Vassy kapelos.
As we heard from the Prime Minister, not so long ago, likely that these new border measures will go into effect overnight.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and I wanted to add a few things to what you and Chris were discussing.
Like you and David and all of us were trying to get as many details about what is going to be in this as possible.
With the caveat and everyone I spoke to very much stressing this caveat that it hasn't entirely been formalized or finalized.
This is what they told me. Who can cross and who can't. In defining it and the way that it is going to be presented, it will focus on who isn't allowed.
Not so much a list of the people who can still cross, but a list of the people who cannot.
and that list is actually really similarly . it's people who are traveling for leisure or just traveling, per.
My question is similar to the one you asked is how much of a dent is that really going to make.
If we're still leaving it porous to everything else, I understand the xhij per tiff.
Will that really affect the numbers and the public health concerns that a lot of people have and the government has as well.
I was shocked by the answer.
There are still -- and they couldn't quantify it perfectly.
But anecdotely, based on the numbers they've seen over the past five days, there are still really, really high levels of people who are crossing the border to either travel or just go for dinner in the United States or vice versa.
So, it is actually -- you know, it shows My sort of naivety in that I assumed because this message is out all the time that it was truly getting through to people.
But not to the degree necessary.
So the internal discussion or the assess meant is that these measures will make a difference.
I heard from a lot of people on this as well.
There will be exceptions, is My understanding, for compassionate grounds.
If you have a relative, like an immediate relative like your mother or father or child or something and your border separates you and there is an illness or death, you will still be allowed to traverse the border.
So My understanding is that will be part of the agreement as well.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
Lots of good details there.
Let me bring people up to date on where things stand on the country right now.
As of last check and the CBC is counting this on a regular, hourly basis, obviously.
772 case of coronavirus now this this country.
Nine deaths overall.
Again, seven in British Columbia.
Many related to that long-term care centre.
One in Ontario and then one death that was confirmed yesterday in Quebec.
Let me bring in Dr. Joshua tepper, the c. E.o. and president of north york general hospital in toronto and a family physician.
Good to see you.



Good to see you.
Good morning.



**Rosemary**:

Good morning.
One other bit of information we got from the Prime Minister there is that there have been about 50, 000 tests in this country but that 25, 000 have been done just over the past week.
Which is part of the reason I would gather that we're seeing these numbers crawl up a little bit because we're just testing more people and discovering more cases of it.



We are testing more people, for sure a. Lot of people would be saying we need to do even broader testing.
We're really getting to the point now where we're clearly seeing community-based transmission.
Not just transmission from people who have been to travel.
and I actually suspect that if we were able and had the capacity to have been doing more testing, at least in some parts of country over the last five days, the numbers would have been even higher in what we've seen.



**Rosemary**:

Do you think that we're not doing enough testing or getting to the right place or how would you evaluate that?



You know, there's two schools of thought.
There's some who think we should be doing a lot more testing.
and really get a feel for where this is. There is others saying listen, we know it's out there.
We know this is widespread.
The people get a fever, if they get a cough, stay home.
If people are getting really sick, come to emerge and we'll start testing the people who we can make clinical decision-making about.
There's a couple schools of thought.



**Rosemary**:

One of the other things that the Prime Minister spoke about is the abilities, if needed, to get military procurement involved in trying to find more supplies and I know that they are working towards building up all of those things.
I think Dr. Tam said yesterday they have about 75% of what they need.
Just from your perspective, do you feel assured or re-assured? do you feel like you have the tools you need in order to deal with this?



I think we're going need to steadily invest in our capacity.
With masks and personal equipment and ventilators.
It is really hard to know exactly what we'll need.
When you look at other jurisdictions, there is -- we know this could be very, very serious and we can't wait too long.
To begin to ramp up that capacity.
So I think we need to hear about that potential.
We need to look at the potential for action and start to get this capacity and the supplies into front line resources.



**Rosemary**:

Can I ask you if you treated anyone so far with the virus?



I definitely screen people with the virus.
Our hospital has -- the hospital I work at has cared for many people.
Several people anyway with the virus.
Fortunately most people to date have had relatively mild disease and that is true with the rest of the world.
But I think in the days ahead, we are going to see more people with more significant disease.



**Marcy**:

All right.
Dr. Tepper, keep up the good work.
Thank you.
Dr. Joshua tepper.
Just a couple of updates on employment insurance.
I know after that announcement yesterday, many of you then immediately obviously went on to the website to try and see how you could start to access some of those benefits once they become available which should be in the days ahead.
On the website right now, it says that they are currently receiving a high number -- there it is there -- high number of e. I. applications.
If you are unable to access the systems or receive an error message, please try again later.
So already people overwhelming the system in terms of just getting information, learning how to register and how to access these benefits once they become available.
I imagine the government is on it. But that is what's happening right now.
a lot of you looking for some support there.
I guess take that message and try again later and see if you can just be patient as the government ramps up its ability to take in those requests and those demands.
Louise martin is the host of "compass" in Charlottetown and she is with us now.
So what kinds of things are people doing there that has changed their lives, I guess, in some way, Louise? because all of us are dealing with that.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
The whole country.
and the measures taken here echo the measures that have been taken across Canada.
Our chief public health officer has been asking people, that critical message, social dis ens thating, self-isolation, if you have traveled outside the country.
It was announced that nonessential services would be included and that incurred liquor and cannabis stores, that I that would be closing at 2:00 p. M. a few hours a after that announcement was made, the chief public health officer expressed her disappointment on what she saw there on your screen.
and that is long line-ups at the liquor and cannabis stores.
Despite these repeated warnings about social distancing.
So, we're anticipating -- so every day we're having a 1:30 briefing from various members of P.E.I.'s government and with Dr. Heather morrison.
So, we're anticipating today to hear that they're changing that somehow.
There will be some measures announced to that liquor store issue and how to stop this panic buying.
There's some private liquor stores who said no need.
We'll be fully stocked.
But everyone is clearly very stressed out and anxiety is running high.
First it was the toilet paper, rosey and now it seems to be liquor and weed that people want to get their hands on. We still only have one case on Prince Edward Island.
But I should note that Dr. Morrison has said that is likely going to change soon.
Our tests are all sent to winnipeg so we have -- I'm looking at our website now.
142 persons under investigation.
So, test results pending.
We should be getting more of those test results today.
In a couple of weeks, P.E.I., Dr. Morrison saying that we should be able to do our own tests here in a couple of weeks so that will alleviate the backlog.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Curious decision to close the liquor and pot stores right now.
But, you know, we'll see how it works out.
I know Newfoundland was also running out of alcohol.
All right, Louise.
Thank you for bringing us perspective from the island.
Appreciate that.



**Reporter**:

Ok. Nice to see you.



**Rosemary**:

The main germ-killing ingredient in hand sanitizer is alcohol and who has more of that than distilleries, of course.
Some of them are changing what they're doing and switching their production to help fight the shortage there.
Cbc's meagan fitzpatrick is at one of thome now and joins us from toronto's distillery district.
Tell us what's been happening and what we're seeing now.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
As you can see, they are distributing the hand sanitize through a window.
This place is closed, of course, to customers.
Normally they would be open for business.
But not under the state of emergency in Ontario.
So they're selling the bottles out the window.
They are donating the proceeds, rosemary, to local food banks and we've seen a lot of people paying lot more than they are being asked to and wanting to support the local food banks.
One woman paying $50 when these are costing $3 so a lot of people wanting to support this effort.
Obviously as we know the need for hand sanitize had been huge.
It's been hard to find.
and spirit of York distillery where we are right now, saying that they have been flooded with requests for this hand sanitizer.
They just started making it a few days ago.
and let's talk to the founder of spirit of York.
I'm going to keep My distance a little bit and ask him some questions from this distance.
This is Jerry and he will Eli the us why they decided to do this.



It has always been part of our mandate to give back to the community.
a couple of weeks ago we thought what can we do? we saw the need for sanitize and realised that, according to the world health organization, one of the key ingredients with us 96% ethanol.
We make it here.
We distill water here.
We just needed two other pieces of puzzle.
We thought we'd shift to support our community in need.



**Reporter**:

It has been a team effort here.
The staff working very hard.
Just let us know how you're feeling about doing this.
How are you coping?



We've been going 24/7 for the past couple of weeks.
We're tired but also kind of proud and kind of excited about being able to do something to help our neighbours and the community around us. Tired but feeling pretty good.



**Reporter**:

Tell us more about the support you've been receiving from some of your partners and the community.



Listen.
We've had -- we had a supplier offer to do labels for us. We had corrugated companies offering to do corrugates for us and we have individuals and labour to help us bottle.
The community has been fantastic.
We've put programmesing to with the lcbo.
They stepped up as well to make some adjustments to our pricing and helping people with economic duress at this point.
It has been wonderful to see the flow, but sad to see the demand.
First line res ponders and medical communities and people taking care of people with preexisting conditions and that has been the toughest thing to deal with.
We need to make more a lot more and need to get everybody that can to maybe shift their operations in order to help.



**Reporter**:

is that your message to other distilleries perhaps? what is your message, Jerry, for them.



Certainly distiller is are stepping up, which is great.
Let's keep doing it. My message is also to the overall business community.
Communities are stepping up. This may be a time for all businesses to look at what can we do? whether it is agreeing to take a smaller profit during this period of time, reduce pricing, give confidence to consumers on the supply chain.
We all need to rally around this.
That's what we do as Canadian, we rally.
We're a small player in a pretty big market.
But it would be great to see the big guys come on board and they have the capabilities and I know they have the values.



**Reporter**:

Thank you, Jerry.
We know a lot of people on scene coming up to the window are really grateful to get their en has on some of this.
a lot of people asking to get it for others, elderly people.
But they have a limited supply right now.
They're working very hard to produce more.
So, so far one bottle per person limit and the line is stretching down the street.
We're in the distillery district, an appropriate place and it is very busy, people coming by and looking for this and wanting more if they can get it. But so far a lot of people showing their appreciation, too, that this distillery here is stepping up to help out the community.
Rosey?



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for that.
Tell all those people in the line to stay far apart because that is not --



**REPORTER**:

That is part of the reason the line-up so long because people are spaced out.
[laughter]



**Rosemary**:

All right.
Thank you, Meagan.
Appreciate that.
You're watching a CBC news special, the latest updates on the coronavirus from the Prime Minister earlier today saying that the border restrictions will go into force likely overnight on Friday.
So be prepared for that.
Suggesting as well that he is working hard with airline companies to try and find ways to bring Canadians back home.
Many still looking to be repatriated.
There was an extraordinary move last night and continues by telecom companies in this country to send out a text message to anyone who has been on a roaming plan with their cell phone.
and we're told by government officials that that was fairly successful in terms of getting people information and telling them what to do next.
Of course, there's still the matter of trying to get them home.
Let's bring in for one last thought, David and Vassy.
I know we're going to hear from a handful of ministers again today to bring us up to date on the latest.
This is going to be a regular occurrence now that we'll see more from all these people on a regular basis.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, it will be regular and that is not a bad thing.
I think Canadians are as hungry for as much information as possible.
You mentioned the border.
I am interested to see the fine print of the agreement once it's finalized, what exactly it ends up meaning for Canadians.
You mentioned travel.
I'm very much paying attention to what I know among our contemporaries is everyone's coming home now for March break, right? so we've been in a bit of a state of flux over the last three days, last four days.
But everyone who left to go on their March break, at least particularly here in Ontario, is coming home at the end of this week and given the announcements we're seeing from airlines and the thing that the Prime Minister said about getting airlines to help, I am watching to see how that process goes, how people are able to come home and what it does to the potential spread of this virus, looking very intent sly at what is happening in the United States today.
The spike of cases that they announced and I know that has a Lot do with testing but also something that we need to look at here and sort of see and watch how it ends up affecting the spread of the virus in this country.



**Rosemary**:

For sure.
and airlines are scaling way back as well.
Air Canada gradually suspending the majority of national and international trans border flightsful west jet is suspending all commercial trans border flights starting on Sunday for a period of 30 days.
Porter airlines suspending all service starting on Friday.
Air transat, gradually suspending flights.
Sun wing has scrubbed all southbound flights.
That is an industry that is feeling the effects of all these travel restrictions and you can well imagine, we heard from Minister Garner a u that there has to be discussion about keeping that industry going the next six to 12 months.



**Reporter**:

I think the thing that people need to be prepared for is a big spike in the number of cases in this country.
Patty hajdu told us yesterday that they approved two new methods of testing.
We had independent testing labs.
More and more people are coming back from abroad and they're going to be symptomatic and going to be tested and we're going see a spike in numbers.
The self-isolation measures that the country is following right now will not see the impact of that for the next couple of weeks.
It takes two weeks at minimum for us to see the impact of all the social isolation and social distancing we are doing right now.
So not freak out when you see the numbers going up because that is expected at this point in time.
Some of it is better data collection through the expansion of testing and heightened awareness.
We need to be prepared nar AR a country because those numbers are scary and eye popping and the curve will spike before it flattens out so people need to be prepared for that.
The thing I want to see over the next little while from the government is the industrialization measures to get equipment into the hospitals, to make sure when it does get worse they can help people get better.



Ok. Thank you for that.
Vassy, thank you.
You can see her at 5:00 p. M. eastern on "power & politics" and David Cochrane later on "the national." thank you both.
Appreciate it again.
Today.
Just a reminder that we're expecting a press conference from various cabinet ministers coming up at the top of the hour.
But the Prime Minister out for a fourth day as he comes into now the middle of his own self-isolation.
One week left for him to basically re-assure Canadians, to remind Canadians that the government is there and as he said will will be there for you as you move forward.
There's lots of information at Canada.
Ca if you are looking for ways to apply for employment insurance or tap into these other measures.
I'm rosemary barton.
This has been a cbc news special.
Continuing coverage continues on cbc news network.



**Suhana**:

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to our special CBC news programming on the coronavirus pandemic.
For the now millions of Canadians staying home and social distancing, we're here for you.
The Prime Minister just addressed the nation from Rideau cottage.
We now know when those Canada-United States border restrictions are likely to come into effect.
We will hear from Ontario premier doug ford this hour.
It is the province, as you know, with the most confirmed cases and we will certainly bring you an update as well from ottawa from.
The COVID-19 response team.
I'm suhana meharchand.
This is cbc news network.
I want to thank you for joining us across Canada and via live stream around the world.
Prime Minister justin trudeau says there is nothing the government won't do to keep Canadians safe.
He addressed Canadians, trying to re-assure them in these unprecedented times.
He also provided an update to the closure of the United States-canadian border to nonessential travel.
Trudeau says those measures will be implemented by this weekend.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The -- we are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada and the United States.
I think it is almost there.
My understanding is that the measures will probably come into place in the night between Friday and Saturday.
So, in about a day and a half.
We are considering using any measures necessary to ensure that Canadians and our health care systems have the supports they need.
We've already been engaged with industry on production and ramping up capacity to build and create more equipment.
We will, of course, look at military procurement as a solution as well.
There is a range of things that we can do. We'll do what is necessary.



**Suhana**:

Cbc's David Cochrane is tracking this story live from our nation's capital.
You could say much of his address was about re-assuring Canadians, david.
There were a few nuggets of news as well.
What did he say about the border, about procurement?



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Re-assuring Canadians a top priority for the government right now, as all of Canada, from the Prime Minister on down struggle to deal with the serious health and economic threats of COVID-19. We saw a lot of that reassurance role, the prime comforter for the government, reminding people that the government within the next two to three weeks going to give money to people who need it most so they can keep food in their fridge and medicine in their cabinet and roof over their head.
That banks are taking pressure off them by allowing people to skip mortgages and defer credit payments if that is required and working to get Canadians stranded abroad home.
Speaking to air Canada, speaking to westjet about what measures they can do. Relying on the telecommunication companies that run cell phones, to send messages and text blasts to Canadians all over the world, to tell them how to inso up and get the help they need and also to get a sense of just how many Canadians may be abroad who haven't registered with the government through their cell phones to find out how many there are, where they are clustered and how they might be able to get them back.
Also, promises from the Prime Minister today to accelerate procurement aggressively and get badly needed equipment into the health care sector.
Working with small and medium-sized and large businesses across the country, to retool their manufacturing capacity, to deal with the peak of the viral outbreak here.
and also focusing, suhana, today on a group that didn't get a lot of mention in the $82 billion of support that was announced yesterday and that is seniors.
People living on fixed incomes.
Maybe they have c. Perform p. and o. a.s. and a pension plan, but a lot of people have their savings and retirement in a market right now that is getting absolutely slaughtered.
So there was a promise today from the Prime Minister to do something in the coming days to help people who apeople living on fixed incomes.
Maybe they have c. Perform p. and o. a.s. and a pension plan, but a lot of people have their savings and retirement in a market right now that is getting absolutely slaughtered.
So there was a promise today from the Prime Minister to do something in the coming days to help people who are living off market sensitive earnings.
Here's what he had to say.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The market disruptions are massive and many Canadians have seen their retirement savings and pensions reduced significantly.
We'll be taking measures to ease the impact of that.
We know that our seniors have worked hard all their lives to be able to retire in comfort and there is a lot of anxiety there.
That's why we will be there for our seniors as well.



**Reporter**:

Suhana, the Sang now.
-- the anxiety is now.
The need is now.
People are worried especially when you look at the social isolation and distancing that is happening but a lot of these measures will take time.
The import measures for caregivers and people who lose their job and don't get e. I., that will take two to three weeks to ramp up. They need to build systems to get things done.
The federal government isn't running at full capacity right now either.
and other measures like a boost to the g. S.t. Rebate.
But that won't happen until may.
The benefit there, the help there is that Canada's big banks have reached an agreement with the government to say we'll stop taking money out.
You can skip your mortgage payments and hold off on your credit.
We'll give you six months of breathing room, at minimum.
So we can get through this as a country and what is truly, suhana, Han unprecedented time.



**Suhana**:

Absolutely.
We'll talk again.
David Cochrane is in Ottawa.
This story is changing, developing all the time.
Happening live from Ontario, this is the province's premier, Doug ford.
Basically holding this press conference to remind not only Ontarian but people across the country that the time is critical now to practice social distancing.
We'll listen in live here on CBC news network.



To help practice social distancing in stores such as offering pickup for customers.
One of things I heard on the call today is they need more flexibility with deliver is from the warehouses so they can restock their shelves.
Right now municipal noise bylaws prevent them from accepting deliveries at certain hours.
They're going to bring temporary changes to allow them to accept deliveries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
So people can continue to get the essentials they need.
and what I heard was despite some pressure on the system due to panicked buying or the supply chains in Ontario and Canada remains strong.
So I'm asking people once again, be patient and do your part to take pressure off our supply chains.
Please don't hoard and don't panic buy.



**Suhana**:

That was Ontario premier there reminding people about social distancing and the need not to buy out of panic.
Taking you live now to our nation's capital where the COVID-19 cabinet team is giving us their briefing.
On your screen right now is deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
We'll listen live now on CBC news network.



Public safety is working hard to ope rationalize this and as we heard from the Prime Minister this morning, we expect the agreement to be enforced by Saturday.
I do want to repeat for Canadians.
What we have agreed to with the United States is the restriction of nonessential travel across our border.
Travelers will no longer be authorized to cross the border for recreational or tourist purposes.
In both of our countries, we are encouraging people to stay home.
This collaborative measure is reciprocal and it is part of the same prudent approach we are taking in each of our own countries.
Border crossings that are essential, however, will continue.
Essential border crossings will not be impeded.
Trade between our two countries will not be impeded.




**Interpreter**:

I would like to repeat this.
What we have agreed upon with the United States is to restrict all nonessential travel across our borders.
Travelers will no longer be entitled to cross the border for tourism and recreational purposes.
and, therefore, each of our countries -- in each of our countries, we're encouraging people to stay home.
This collaborative measure is reciprocal and is part of our prudent approach.
However, border crossings that are essential will continue.
Essential border crossings will not be affected.
Trade between our two countries will not be affected either.
I would also like to discuss the situation of asylum-seekers on roxham road.
I have had two conversations with the Quebec Minister of justice and the person who is responsible for Canada relations, sonia la belle, and I've also consulted with all provincial premiers, including with premier legault.
We have agreed to temporarily house, as of tomorrow, all asylum-seekers in order to ensure that they are all quarantined for 14 days.
From anyone else who -- rather, just as everyone else coming into the country should do.



I want to thank all of the Canadian, whether it is health care workers, the people who will clean this room after we leave it, the people keeping our grocery shelves stocked for working so hard to get us through this difficult situation.
Ok. We will now hear from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Tam.
After that, we'll hear from the Minister of indigenous services, mark miller.
and then as you see other ministers and medical officers are available to answer your questions.
Dr. Tom Wong, the chief medical officer of public health at indigenous services Canada and in addition to Dr. Tam, we have Dr. Njoo available and, of course, our Minister of health.
Ok. Dr. Tam



Good afternoon.
So, globally, there are now close to 230, 000 cases of COVID-19 in over 177 countries.
In Canada, as of now, there are 772 cases and nine deaths of COVID-19. We now have 10 confirmed cases in c. F.b. Trenton.
We tested over 55, 000 people for COVID-19 across Canada.
That is approximately 10, 000 since yesterday tested.
What continues to concern us is the day by day sharp increase in cases and the reports from provinces of new cases with no links to trafm.
These signals of community spread are the focus of investigations and interruptions to slow the spread of the virus.




**Interpreter**:

Public health authorities across Canada remain dedicated to finding cases and their contacts and interrupting transmission chains.
By changing our behaviours and practicing social distancing.
Each one of us can and must find all possible ways to introduce opportunities for this virus to spread.
We know that COVID-19 can affect any community anywhere in Canada.
However, we must recognize that first nations, Inuit and mÉtis are at higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, given health inequities, higher rates of underlying medical conditions and unique health challenges such as those faced but remote and fly-in/fly-out communities.



As the epidemic continues to grow in Canada, public health authorities remain dedicated to finding cases in the contact and interruptioning transmission chains.
By changing our behaviours and practicing social distancing, each one of us can find owl possible ways to reduce opportunities for this virus to spread.
We know that COVID-19 can affect any community anywhere in Canada.
However, we must recognize that first nations, Inuit and mÉtis are at higher risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19, given health inequities, higher rates of underlying medical conditions and unique health conditions by remote fly in and fly out communities.
We have the opportunity to learn from each other about resolve and resiliency.
a news release issued by the first nation in Alberta speaks to this really well.
It stated we have always been survivors.
We survived residential schools, we survived a massive flood in 2013 and we are resilient people.
We, too, will survive and overcome this most recent adversity.
To get through this health crisis, we need to support each other, find ways to practice social distancing and protect our elders and those with medical conditions.
The measure of a society is how it protect its most vulnerable.




**Interpreter**:

To get through this health crisis, we need to support each other.
Find ways to practice social distancing in different context and protect our elders and seniors and those with medical conditions.
The measure of a society is in how it protects its most vulnerable.



Our checkive resolve must be solid and unbendable.
We don't just need to flat en the curve, we need to plank it and we need everyone from government to communities, families and individuals to work together.
We all have to get it right and get it right right now because the price of not doing so is too high.
This is our chance right here, right now.
Merci.



**Interpreter**:

Thank you, Dr. Tam.



Now we'll hear from Marc miller.



Thank you, Dr. Tam.
Merci.
 good afternoon.
Bonjour.



**Interpreter**:

Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
I'm going to start by acteneding j-acknowledging that we're on the unseated territory of the algonquin people.
The situation with COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and I would like the say that the government's top priority is the health and safety of all people in Canada, including first nations, inuit and mÉtis.



a priority that is shared by the entirety of government.
We can't shy away from the fact that indigenous peoples in Canada are more vulnerable than non indigenous Canadians.
We saw this during h1n1.
We saw this during sars.
We've learned from those events but the reality remains that indigenous people in Canada experience more overcrowding, a higher burden of chronic disease and some live in highly remote places in this country.
It's because of this vulnerability that My department and this government is focused on the specific needs of indigenous communities.




**Interpreter**:

Canada's response to date is based on science and conclusive evidence.
That is something that we should be very proud of. We must also remain focused on sharing this information and adapt our practices to reflect genuine needs of indigenous communities in Canada.
So that we can recognize the vulnerability of many of these communities in Canada.
Many of these communities volume these measures by taking to heart the advice issued and this includes the cancellation of large gatherings and support for individuals who must self-isolate as well for mental health as well as mental health supports.
I encourage all leaders to follow this advice and the directive given by experts in your regions.



Make sure that essential services like primary health care or social services are in place for everyone in Canada.
and especially for the vulnerable.
This means making sure integration to the health systems -- [inaudible] but also means taking specific actions to support indigenous needs.




**Interpreter**:

We haven't waited for the next pandemic to start planning for the next one.
We have invested some $87 million in the planning of these supports and that puts us in a situation that is much better than the last pandemic.



The vulnerability of indigenous community, then we need to back this up with action which is exactly what we've done.



**Interpreter**:

In response, indigenous services Canada has begun proactively putting in measures and to plan emergency intervention.
In collaboration with indigenous ed looers, we have examined indigenous pandemic plans, stocked supplies and evaluated health care demands.
and this will all be implemented.



The $100 million announced last week will go a long way to ensuring these critical needs are met.
We invite communities to submit requests to their regional networks to access funding which will be distributed in line with public health advice and based on need.
This funding will also further enable the provision of supplies and nursing capacity in communities.
Including ensuring resources are available where needed.
Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that we will be investing $305 million for a new distinctions based indigenous community support fund to address the immediate needs of in digit now communities.
These additional measures will help families get through the difficult period.
This funding will also enable indigenous organisations and communities to make their own decisions about where critical support is needed to address this public health emergency.
We're working closely to develop the community support fund and ensure rapid access to those who need it the most.
We'll have more to say on this very soon.
The most important message I want to communicate today is to indigenous community and leaders.
Indigenous services is here to help adapt and activate plans for your communities.
No community will be left behind.
We are here to mobilize supplies.
We are here to address the vulnerabilities of the indigenous community and we can only do this in close collaboration with indigenous leadership across this country.
Meegwetch.
Thank you.
Merci.



Ok. Thank you very much.
We're ready to start taking your questions.







**Interpreter**:

As you know, we're going to go with the room and then go to the telephone.



First of all, a question in English.
It is on the equipment.
I was wondering what were the province's requests at this point.
Did you receive any request and dead you share any equipment with them?



I'll start and then send it to Dr. Tam.



Turn on your mic, patty.



Very good point.
We've been working with the provinces and territories for quite some time on trying to determine what equipment they think they might need, what kinds of testing equipment they might need.
Personal protective equipment including ventilators that obviously has been spoken about quite a bit.
We have a federal stockpile, as you know, that has been requested by provinces in terms of shortages that they might be having right away.
It is very difficult to talk about exact numbers because it is like a revolving door.
There is equipment coming in. There are materials coming in. Just as fast as those are coming in, they are going out.
I've had personal conversations with ministers about what they might be facing in a couple of days and we've been able to resolve those very quickly.
We're continuing that work to determine what provinces need immediately.
They anticipate their long-term needs are going to be and then in terms of what -- how we can prepare at a federal level.
So, I'll turn it to Dr. Tam if you do have anything more specific than that.



No. I think as the Minister said, it can be extremely specific about things like lab supplies but we've been able to get the swabs and other things that the provinces needed, and including trying to get on board these new tests, for example.
I know one item that people have always looked for was masks that are for health care workers and we know there's been a request in the shorter term for seven million.
We got suppliers to be able to cover about 75% of that.
These are ongoing discussions with suppliers to keep getting more.
We anticipate that may not be enough.
So we anticipate on keep going and getting more supplies.



Asking for masks and swabs.
Are they already asking for ventilators and how do you decide who you give to?



So I have to say it has been a positive conversation at the political level.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam for the medical professional level of collaboration.
We may be in a position where we need to share and may have the capacity to do that.
Because it won't that everyone is sick all at once and hoping to flat en the curve, we can actually protect communities that don't see a high degree of community transmission from getting a first case in some cases or getting multiple cases, that there may be a capacity then and having a surge in one part of the country to cover those critical cases.
This is the work happening on a regular basis at thee the Yale, provincial and federal level, both on the political level to make sure that we have political will and direction to do so and at the technical level that Dr. Tam is involved in.



All right.
Next question.



**Reporter**:

Minister miller, I have two questions for you.
Manitoba is part of the bulk [inaudible] and saying that they're not giving them enough masks and equipment.
Who gets first dibs? how do you prioritize between the federal plan and the provincial demands?



Go ahead and answer that one.



Thank you, Dylan.
First, this is key and it speaks to the coordination that we need to have at all levels.
In din now services Canada has been working quite directly with the health officers in communities to establish needs.
a lot of the communities and the information we have is that 87% of indigenous communities have pandemic or epidemic plans.
Obviously they need to be updated.
What we're encouraging leadership to do is work with their health authorities and their health officers, health leadership, nurses, doctors to establish the needs and priorities that they need to co-ordinate and filter through the primary health provider, which is the provinces and then supported by indigenous services Canada to the extent and I've said this quite clearly they feel they are not getting the response that they are entitled to. They are to directly contact me and My team directly in order to have a discussion about what the needs and resources are so that we can fill them.
There is a surge stockpile available to be used specifically in that instance of a surge.
In terms of initial health message in getting that message out, we are adamant in ensuring that communities have that message and directing their members to observe it. and then confirming the next stage of the pandemic.
Whether it's hand washing devices, gloves, gowns, mask,, etc.
and those are needs that we will address absolutely promptly.



That's been criticism over the amount that has been allocated.
The $100 million.
It's not clear if it's going to equipment or if that's enough to ship thing along the ice roads and elsewhere.
I'm wondering how you can walk us through how you came up with that number and how it is sorted among distinctions and if it is prioritized for most need and population.
It's super is unclear.



On the amount that was announced by the Prime Minister, the $100 million, this is to address specifically that surge capacity.
We know from our experience specifically with h1n1 that not only are these communities disproportionately affected, it continues with the first wave and second wave in difference regions in a disproportionate fashion.
We have to be ready for that and I would defer to tom wong to develop on that.
So, we need that money to co-ordinate with regions and that involves the feedback and discussions that we have with leadership and medical officials in community as they share that information and coordination with territories and provinces.
and as you know, different parts of the country have different delegated authorities when we speak about the territories and fnha and British Columbia.
there are different ways of channeling that information in responding to it. The $305 million was to address the immediate needs of communitis that are bulking up and addressing key needs in community on top of getting out the most important thing that has proven to show the outcome, which is getting out the public health messages that were hitings on so hard across Canada.
That is money that will be addressed in very, very short order to reflect a number of elements.
Obviously population.
Obviously remoteness.
Obviously need.
We will be elaborating and getting out in short order.
So, all those demands we're asked for will be put out in community and deferring to them.
At the same time, My regional officers are deploying more modest emergency funds that we had in order to address even more immediate needs.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

There is work being done to establish air bridges to evacuate people stranded abroad.
Can you be specific, please? what are the countries that are a priority for you where people could go to be repatriated? what are the priorities there?







**Interpreter**:

This afternoon, during the COVID-19 cabinet committee, Minister champagne will be speaking to the committee about his consular plan.
I would like to point out that this is something that is a massive effort.
There are many Canadians who have not, through no fault of their own, are abroad and who are trying to come home.
and we are trying to help them.
I cannot be more specific to that at this time because there are a great many Canadians who are abroad right now.
But I would like to say that Minister champagne and global affairs Canada are doing excellent work.
They're making major efforts to help Canadians who are abroad at this time.
There is one detail.
That is complicating these efforts.
and that is there are countries and everyone know this is now because everyone has become an expert on coronavirus.
But there are countries who have completely shut down their borders and I know that for Canadians who happen to be in those countries, this is especially difficult.
But we are also seeking to fix the situation for those people.
Would you like to add something, Minister?



Yes.
Thank you, Chrystia.



**Interpreter**:

Very quickly, we know how much we're thinking of Canadians who are abroad.
Our thoughts are with them.
Usually there are some three million Canadians who are abroad and many of them want to come home now.
For the next weeks and there are four levels of intervention.
One is for people who need a little bit of time but who are -- so there is $5, 000 in emergency loans for people to come home.
The second something that for airline companies, we know that they are continuing to fly commercially but these flights are more and more rare.
So these companies are calling on the government's assistance and we're trying to cooperate with them to bring back Canadians from abroad.
The third measure is to work with the countries concerned to ensure that consular services are provided as usefully as possible.
and the last thing is that the Minister champagne will give more details later.
We're working to take into account emergency conditions because some of these countries are unable to work with airline companies.
All Canadians have the right to come home.
That is very important to point out because I've had a number of questions even from family members in My riding and so I want to point this out.
and also as Minister champagne said on the weekend, and as Dr. Tam has said this is not the time to engage in nonessential travel.
Inaudible for the interpreter.
Answer -- we strongly encourage Canadians who are abroad to come back to take advantage of commercial flights that still exist.
We know that these are going to become more and more seldom and, as deputy Prime Minister said, we're going to have the conversations today to follow-up on this because despite all the efforts that people are making abroad, there will be Canadians who will need additional assistance to come back home.
Thank you.



Dr. Tam, you have appealed to Canadians's can-do spirit to help them fight this outbreak and slow it down.
Can you level with canadian and tell them how many vent lays toer and how many hospital beds are needed beyond what we have in the system.



I think provinces and territories in charge, of course, of the hospitals and hospital beds and they have any requirements for support, we have a mechanism to do that.
We have had no specific requests for ventilators at this point.
What we're doing at the federal level is just to pre-empt that by essentially acquiring some n any case, that should provinces or territories need it. So, ventilators have to come with an actual team and, of course, [inaudible] and so the provinces are in the best position to actually determine exactly what that arrangement is but, of course, if they need anything, they know that there is a mechanism to do all of that, support for mutual aid as the Minister said between jurisdictions.



I think trying to ask for a specific number is a little bit misleading for Canadians in the sense that so much depends on a, our efforts to flatten the curve.
B, what happens when the virus hits various populations.
We have some indication from science, but of course things -- the science is evolving in terms of the severity of expression and different populations and so the provinces and territories are doing that hard work as Dr. Tam said, to prepare as much space in their hospital systems as possible.
Clearing out nonessential surgeries, making sure that they have additional space for additional intensive care capacities.
Making sure that they have the equipment and Dr. Tam said the people available to actually provide services in an intensive way and on the flipside, doing as much as possible to prevent people from becoming that ill.
So I think it is somewhat disingenuous to say we have x number of ventilators that that would be enough or not enough.
The work is happening at the provincial and er the Yale level.
We're very confident that the province are taking this with the utmost of seriousness and they're having regular daily conversations with Dr. Tam through public health and a number of other technical working groups as we see the epidemiology in our own country that we can rap -- rapid enough to respond to any surge in the country.



**Reporter**:

How are you going to ensure that there are enough front line workers in indigenous communitis? and as well, when do you plan to have those medical screening tests in temporary shelters in place in indigenous communities?



Thank you.
Excellent questions.
As many people are aware, a lot of the nursing relationships are around short term contracts and moving quite quickly to see what measures we can put in place to address that.
We are working with community directly to see what their health working needs are specifically.
and taking a number of concrete measures to ensure that they do have the resources, including personnel available on request as they are requesting and there is a lot of interplay that needs to be done and perfected, in fact, with territories and provinces to ensure that there is a seamless access to those needs.
Do you have something you want to add? Dr. Tom Wong is My chief medical officer in indigenous Canada for everyone's benefit.



Thank you very much.
In addition to having individual contracts in place, we have a team specifically dedicated to surge capacity.
We want to make sure that surge capacity is available from coast to coast to coast so if the west is having a problem we can mobilize resources from the east to address that so no indigenous communities are left behind.
Not one single first nations mÉtis or Inuit.
We want that to be left behind.
One of key things is that for first nations, mÉtis and Inuit, we want to support them together with our provinces and territories to run faster than the virus.
Thank you.



Do you want to say a few words on screening? on screening, and perhaps Dr. Tam will correct me if I'm wrong, there are various protocols within provinces as to how you get screened and tested as well as the availability of kits to testing communities.
So, we're very conscious of the need that exists and some of the demands that have been made specifically with respect to testing kits and the ability to have some mobility within community.
But, again, this is an element of the communication relationship that we need to have with territories and provinces to make sure, one, access is the same as with no in -- indigenous communities and where that protocol is in place to have that testing and feedback in order to put people into isolation as the case may be, as they manifest symptoms is seamless within communities as well as without.
Dr. Tam or Dr. Wong?



As the signs evolve and as our public health measures evolve, so will our laboratory testing approach.
We'll have another conversation just after this media briefing with all provinces and territories.
Needless to say, actually, when we look at groups, indigenous communities or people experiencing any illness or outbreak is actually in the priority list and for discussion.



Thank you.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Question for ms. Freeland.
I would like you to clarify what you said about roxham road because the Prime Minister and Minister Blair said something and you said that the [inaudible] asylum-seekers will be taken into custody as of tomorrow.
and so can you clarify that, please?







**Interpreter**:

Ye, isolation quarantine is mandatory right now.
What I said, is that as of tomorrow, the federal government and Minister Mendocino who will organize housing for these asylum-seekers because we understand that it is one thing to isolate for 14 days and at the federal government, we understood that we must take responsibility for that.
and so that is what we're going to do to organize housing.
To be sure that it is possible for these asylum-seekers knob quarantine.
-- to be in quarantine.
and I'd like to point out that we have decided to organize that in very close collaboration with Quebec.
With premier legault who is with the other premiers during the call that we had yesterday.
We discussed all of that.
and I spoke with Mr. La belle from Quebec and I would like to thank Minister mendoccino because this is very hard work that he is doing.
Do you want to add anything?







**Interpreter**:

I would like to assure all Canadians that we're [inaudible] in the world.
I would like to thank all My colleagues, especially Minister Blair.
He is a very important partner and the work that is being done at roxham road is very important.
So with this announcement, we're creating spaces to ensure isolation for everyone.
Everyone who crosses the border in an irregular fashion will have to go into isolation without exception.
I would like to add, to be clear, this is a crisis.
This is an emergency.
That is why emergency measures are being taken.
We need to be sure that government measures are not unlined for people crossing the border and make sure that they're isolated for at least 14 days as anyone else would have to do as they come across the border.
Thank you.
Therefore, you spoke with the Quebec authorities.
and so are you ready to obey Quebec's request about putting people in federal buildings? answer -- well, as I said, now the federal government has decided to shoulder this responsibility.
The federal government is now ensuring that all asylum-seekers who come through roxham road are isolated for 14 days and that they have the resource necessary to be able to do so. Inaudible for the interpreter.
That will be established in the next little while.
Thank you.



The social distancing measures only came into force in a big way this week.
At what point do you expect to see those numbers change? is it two weeks from now for the incubation period and what happens if we don't see those numbers go down? what action can we expect to see further social isolation measures coming from the federal government?



Yes.
So I always tell people it is a bit like watching the light coming from the star.
What you're seeing reported today is something that happened a while back.
So certainly maybe two weeks back even after the cases that would have contracted the illness and then they had to be tested, etc.
So, maybe what we're seeing now is the day-to-day increase is something that happened before.
What I would like to see, and I'll be watching very closely, is in the next two weeks or so, what actually happens to that curve.
That's really, really important.
So we'll keep everybody informed.
But beyond that, you have to keep going.
In countries like china and south korea and a others, they had many, many cases, of course.
But it took them quite a few weeks and overall about two and a half months to get their bigger outbreaks under control.
So our like to see is not even get there so that's why I'm saying plank the thing right now.



**Reporter**:

Can you give us a sense of how severe they are, what the demographic ks are in terms of age and gender and how that compares to other countries that are ahead of us in terms of this pandemic?



I think the democratic profile is similar in that there's quite a large number of cases in the working adult age group.
The severe illnesses are occurring in the older age group, particularly people over 70 years of age.
Some of the deaths that you've just heard reported was actually at least six or related to a single long-term care facility.
So My key message is that anything that we do should be to protect these very, very vulnerable settings.
Do not let the virus enter any settings where older people live and people with underlying medical conditions because this is what some of the impacts would look like.
I think that's what we're seeing now.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible]. first nations children and business communities struggle sometimes to get access to funding, which is why we have jordan's principle, for instance.
How are you going to make sure indigenous communities can access this funding quickly and cut through this red tape?



Thank you, Brett.
That funding continues.
It continues and it is on the request basis that we have addressed at the department.
Even for systemic ask.
So, we are moving as diligently as we can to deploy those moneys to children and into communities.
Over $3005 million.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible].



That is precisely what we're discussing in our department today.
Our expectation is to deploy that money out as quickly as possible into communities.
and that is My instruction to My team.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] a. What has been done to prepare for something like this?



Well, a number of things.
The historic [inaudible] that we put into housing which hasn't addressed the under capitalization in communities to address overcrowding goes to the social determinants that make indigenous community vulnerable at the outset.
This is unacceptable.
The deployment into ensuring the removal of boil water advisories, heavy investment into infrastructure to make sure that we're addressing the building of hospitals and a increasing of capacity, funding over jordan's principle.
These are all critical elements that have closed those socioeconomic gaps that are absolutely unacceptable in a country as ours.
We have the world's best health care system and indigenous peoples are the first people to be negatively impacted by it. In less sons learned from h1n1, a number of thing.
I would ask Dr. Tom wong to elaborate.
But some of measures we're putting into place, the basic public hygiene messages of social isolations, quarantining in some cases, separation, hand washing are key to ensure that that curve is flattened as a way Dr. Tam has described.
These measures should be underscored at every single opportunity and then we get into issues which you address which are capacity and making sure that communities have their pandemic plans in place.
87% report that they do have plans.
We'll help them update for this one.
In the first wave of h1n1, as I mentioned earlier there were disproportionate regions affected.
and indigenous communities were sometimes three, four, five times affected by h1n1.
We recognize this and it is because of the social determinants that I described to you earlier.
These things are not acceptable.
We cannot shy away from the fact that this is not a question of if, but a question of when.
Indigenous communitis have a chance to repair and address this and flatten the curve on a community basis.
There is a number of related elements to remote and isolated communitis that we need to address.
People that are at high risk.
I think immediately of women that need to give birth.
Sometimes they need to go out of community and have the supports in place.
They are not overcrowded, that they're transported in private cars and we'll have funds and resources deployed to them so they do not become carriers and that their birthing experiences done in a fashion as any nonindigenous canadian would expect.
These are all elements that play into a strategy that will address this.
Considering and respectful and understanding of that vulnerability, Dr. Wong.



Thank you, Mr. Miller.
We support indigenous communities in preparing and planning for any kind of emergencies, including as Minister miller said that over 85 communities have plans.
Involved in that is we support communities to plan to prepare as well as to exercise testing the plans as well as implementing the plans and with the additional investments that we heard recently.
That would be tremendous help for the communities.
One of things -- one of the things we have to remember is the social determinants of health.
We support the communities in addressing those communities and it has to be a partnership between governments, public health departments and the communities.
Indigenous communities have been telling us about something that's so important, which is culture, culture as prevention, culture as treatment and culture as resilience and that is something we support.
Thank you.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] calling states of emergency right now.
What do you do when that happens? how does the government react?



We react immediately.
We take every state of emergency declared by a community with -- with the immense respect that the decision-making process that those communities took to declare a state of emergency.
Not all state of emergencies reflect the same realities on the ground.
Some communities are more vulnerable because they are subject to historic flooding.
In tandem with that and thinking forward of the impact of COVID-19 on those communities, as a precautionary measure, that I will declare a state of emergency so they make sure that those resources and their capacity to plan internally is reflected as a feedback.
So we'll engage with them directly.
Other communities will declare states of emergency because of a significant reality on the ground.
I think of the six nations that has done so, they want to reallocate their resources and get it out seamlessly to their community that addresses their protocol and that is something we have to re. Respect.
They want to put in plans to keep people from coming and going and we need to respect and reflect allocation of resources.
If a community declares a state of emergency, that is not a recondition to accessing this funding.
They do so for their own reasons.
They're reasons that we respect.
But they are reasons that declare their state of urgency and in some cases allows them to move forward on a quicker basis with their own community planning.



One last in the room and then go to the phone.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] we were all promised questions.



a little less than 10 minutes I am told.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible]. through a variety of different programmes.
At the same time, most publicker is vans are working from home.
I know there's been challenges within the ability to work from home.
Do you think they will believe able to deliver those programmes with all of those challenges?



We are very fortunate to have in Canada a public service with amazing equal and that is true in international terms as well and we understand the challenges that they themselves go through their personal lives.
We also are [inaudible] of the important responsibility they have in serving Canadians in these very difficult times.
So, we're making it -- making everything possible to protect both their health and their security and that of their family and ones and to make sure that we have all that we need to execute the type of things we announced yesterday.
We'll do things that are extraordinary.
But that is fine in extraordinary times.
There will be ways of delivering services and benefits that we had never seen before in Canada.
But will be making it more quick and efficient to deliver the important benefits and support that Canadians will need in the next few weeks.



On the border, how exactly is this going to work? if an American visitor shows up to a land crossing on Saturday afternoon, are they going to have to make clear that they're not coming to visit family or something like that? do they have to be pulling a tractor-trailer to be getting across the border?



What will happen at the border, and by the way I hope is already happening now, is people should not be traveling between Canada and the United States.
The United States and Canada, to be a tourist or for recreational purposes.
If you have an important, essential reason to cross the border, you can continue to do that.
and let me give you an example of camp robello observe port Roberts.
There are communities in the United States and Canada for whom their daily life requires crossing the border and those border crossings will continue.
We've emphasized that trade will continue and so particularly I do want to speak to truck drivers because we need them to keep on crossing the border to supply our grocery stores and medical goods and America needs truck drivers to Be's cooing the border in the other direction.
Trade, which is essential, border crossings which are essential, will continue to happen.
What we are saying is don't make discretionary trips and that is what border officials will be enforcingment we believe that this should come into force from Saturday.
But I do want to emphasize, don't wait until Saturday to do this.
Just as we're urging people to practice social distancing here in Canada.
Part of social distancing is not making discretionary trips across the border and I really hope all Canadians are doing that.
and we've been asking Americans to do that, too.
For a while.
and the United States government is on board with that approach.
I think it's all about being good neighbours to each other.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible]. on a commons health committee that border crossings are pointless.
There is zero evidence that border crossings limit the spread of any pandemic.
Can you elaborate? the science hand changed in three weeks.
Can you elaborate on that point?



Certainly.
From a public health perspective.
But we said that border measures alone won't stop the introduction of a virus into the Ci. As I mentioned at the hearing, obviously people can be asymptomatic and enter the country.
However, we also said that border measures are one component, one layer of a multilayered system.
The most important part of the system obviously is the health care system, public health integrated to be able to rapidly detect cases, isolate them and follow up on contacts.
We've done a great job so far.



**Reporter**:

There are millions of dollars in there that would be lapsed appropriations.
$96 million for the tourism commission.
Everyone staying home.
Nobody is flying to Amsterdam for v. E. day.
Speaking of unnecessary funds that could be spent on ventilators, you have a multi million dollar cost of living increase for M.P.s, senators kicking in on April 1. Who's volunteering for a wage freeze in this moment of national emergency?



There were a lot of elements in that question.
Embedded in it was an implicit assertion that somehow there would not be enough money to buy the ventilators necessary for Canada and Canadians, and let me be very clear with everyone that we will spend whatever it takes to support the health and safety of Canadians.
What you have heard from the government when it comes to roxham road is an example of how federal-provincial responsibility is not something we're going to quibble over.
The federal government is prepared and is taking the lead.
and that very much includes the health care system.
I don't want any canadian to think that a lack of money or even arguments about who's responsible for paying the bills is going to, in any way, impede our national response to this global pandemic.
and I see patty nodding her head and maybe she wants to say something, add something.



No, I think you covered it and we've been clear from the beginning that this is an all hands-on-deck moment for Canada.
I will also point out that some of the challenges that we're trying to solve, it's actually not money.
Even though it seems like if you throw more money at a problem, some of them are actually challenges of research capacity, to actually be as adept and as quick as possible.
We've tried to solve for that with money as well and as of today, as you know, are putting even more money towards research around cures, vaccines and understanding the nature of the virus, looking long-term to whether or not there are other measures we can use to flatten the kufrn, how we move forward from a historic moment in our country and, in fact, the globe.
That is very important work as well.
[please stand by]



> and to understand more about the virus, and to have a response that can be based on science to actually contribute to the global research that is happening to end this, would say scurge, this global scurge, that weirdly enough money is not the only answer to.



Thank you.
One last question from theroom.



Countries around the world are starting to arrest people who are not operating in quarantine and self-isolating.
is there any situationwhere that could happenhere in Canada?



We're going to start with Dr. Tam offering some thoughts about that.



**Doctor**:

Well, I think our whole concept is to get everybody to do the right thing, and ingeneral, based on otherexperiences, like the sarssituation in Toronto, Canadians contribute by doing the right thing.
There are some very powerful quarantine acts within every level ofgovernment, particularly at the local level.
So there could be somecircumstances.
If someone is particularly high risk to someoneelse's health, that such approaches can beexercised.
But one is not aiming for that to be the keyresponse.



**Reporter**:

For the --



is that your personalopinion?



**Reporter**:

No. I was curious about that.
I know people are trapped in Peru.
So what consular supports are we doing to help those people trapped for this period of time?



**WE'RE DOING TWO THINGS**:

One is providing consularsupports, and they should be getting in touch with consular services andcanadian diplomats there.
We are providing, also, fund to help people support themselves during that period because people traveled not expecting that their time outside the country would beextended.
and at the same time, we are working urgently to find a way to help those people come home.
But I would say is, if you are a person in situation like that, or you know a person en a in situation like that, and each one of us is constituent M.P., and eachone of us have heard fromfriends and family of suchpeople, the first thing todo is get in touch withglobal affairs Canada, there is a hotline, letpeople know you're there, and that's how we canstart to support you.
I do want to say, it is avery complex situation.
We understand howfrightening it is forpeople, and we're workingto get through it.



Folks, we've already gone over.
We'll take to questions on the phone and we'll wrap it up.



**Caller**:

Thank you.

Do you have a question? [inaudible]
