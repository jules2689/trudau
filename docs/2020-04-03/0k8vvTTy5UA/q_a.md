**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
I'm wondering what your message is to retirees seeing their savings practice dramatically hit by changes in the market.
is the government looking at, for example, supplementing o. a.s. Or g. I.s. Or is there anything that you will be doing for them?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that the market disruptions are massive and many Canadians have seen their retirement savings and pensions reduced significantly.
We'll be taking measures to ease the impact of that.
We know that our senior have worked hard all their lives to be able to retire in comfort and there is a lot of anxiety the.
That is why we will be there for our seniors as well.



please go ahead.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Today you unveiled an economic support plan.
What are the work scenarios that you are thinking of? are we expecting job losses across this country? do you have any numbers on what you're expecting in that regard? obviously we're looking at a lot of different scenarios and preparing for these various scenarios.
We do hope that it will be as few as possible.
and that is why we're trying to counter the spread through these various measures.
Whether it is by encouraging people to stay at home or encouraging people to work from home or helping people to get new sources of revenue if they cannot work.
We're hoping people come through this with as little impact as possible and few hospitalizations as possible.
We're prepared for a more severe impact.
But we are focused on the idea that we can avoid the worst possible scenario.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Merci.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
There are a number of people who are stuck abroad and asking for help to come back home.
They left several weeks ago when the pandemic was already under way.
Some people are saying perhaps they weren't careful enough.
What do you think about this and do you think we should nevertheless deploy resources to bring them back home? I think what we're doing now, it's designed to help all Canadians.
We're not going to make any judgments with respect to what people have done.
We want to help them.
That is why we're working with the airline companies to try and facilitate their return to Canada wherever they may be because they are difficult times.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are focused on bringing Canadians home.
We are focused on trying to get our air operators to facilitate more flights to get Canadians home.
We recognize that this is a very difficult and exceptional situation.
and we're just going to be here for each other.
Merci.



The first question is from the Canadian press.



Caller:



There are numbers aboutdemographics, and numbers about communitytransmission, and when you said a little earlier this is a picture of what happened before.
Can you tell us, are those numbers transmissions that happened 10 days before, two weeks before? can you be specific?



**Doctor**:

First of all, there are a lot of numbers in there.
and I encourage you to look at our website.
and it should have some breakdowns in terms ofage, for example.
You will see that there ISS bulk of cases in the more adult, working agegroup.
But, of course, the severe illness is more at theold-age groups or peoplewith underlying medicalconditions.
Based on the data that wehave available, approximately 83%, ithink, is now linked totravel or the contacts ofpeople who have traveled.
Of the rest -- that's theinteresting part, that'sthe bit where we want tounpack it to see if thereis any evidence ofcommunity transmission.
But what we do know is itis important to describethe clusters, like in thelong-term care facilities, and cases linked tocertain complexes.
It is domesticallyacquired, and maybe therewas a traveler somewherein that particularcluster.
But if we can trace it toa cluster and link it, that's a good sign.
It is when you haveindividual, we call pop-upcases, where youabsolutely cannot linkthem, then that is a signthat community, howeverlimited, transmission isoccurring.
We have a few of thosecases.
The majority of provinceshave done a lot of tests, as you're seeing, and arenot seeing any evidence ofcommunity transmission.
But there are definitelycases, though, that don'thave those links, and thepublic health authoritiesare working really, reallyhard to see how they canactually link them.
But I don't want people to be sort of complacentbecause I think with thistrajectory and increasingin numbers, we have somedegree of communitytransmission.
But anything that is morewidespread, any severespectrum, we will detectin Canada.
That much we know.



Okay.
So just to make sure, and then My question is formr.
Declaude.
This is the exact number you gave a little earlier this week, so that has notmoved, and you haven'tchecked it again.
But Mr. Declaude --[speaking throhinterpreter]mr. Declaude, you weretalking about federaljurisdiction, and wasthere some type ofparallel between quebecand Canada, and is thatwhy it took so long to getto those on roxham road? [speaking throhinterpreter]I had to leave for anotherimportant engagement, buti will try to answer.
What we want to sayconcerning the housing ofasylum-seekers, crossingroxham road, is that weunderstand that we are allin an extraordinarysituation.
and extraordinary timescall for an extraordinaryresponse.
and that is why thefederal government, Minister mendaccino, hastaken the decision to findhousing for theseasylum-seekers.
We understand thatisolation is verydifficult.
It's even difficult forcanadian travelers who arecoming back to Canada.
So we understand that itis a good idea for thefederal government toorganize spaces whereasylum-seekers canself-isolate, and that iswhat we have decided to doas of tomorrow.
and I would also like topoint out that we havedecided to do that in veryclose collaboration withour Quebec counterparts.
and I would like tosincerely thankmr.
Labelle, of Quebec, who has been a very goodpartner and has helped usto organize that.
[end of translation]



**I'M TEASING BECAUSEENGLISH OBVIOUSLY ISEASIER FOR ME. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ROXHAMROAD, LET ME JUST SAYTHIS, WHICH IS**:

These areextraordinarycircumstances.
I think we all understandthat.
and in extraordinarycircumstances, it is essential for the federalgovernment, indeed, for all of us, to behave -- to rise to that extraordinarychallenge.
For that reason, and understanding that isself-isolating is hard --self-isolating is hardeven for Canadians wholive here and who havebeen coming home fromtrips.
So we have decided, andspecifically ministermendaccino, has taken onthe responsibility, beginning tomorrow, offinding places where theirregular border crossers, who cross the border atroxham road, and<] who, likeeveryone else who comesinto Canada, need toself-isolate for 14 days.
We are going to provide aplace where that canhappen.
I don't know, marco, ifyou would like to addanything?



No. I think you have capturedeverything.
Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
One last question on thephone, please.



Thank you.
The next question is from the Toronto star."



**Caller**:

Hi, everybody.
The Prime Minister this morning mentioned the possibility of military procurement for the essential supplies that we need.
I'm wondering if you can explain how that wouldwork, what that exactlymeans, and what supplies that could be used for?



So let me -- did you want to answer that? let me just say when it comes to procurement, Minister Anita an an will be speaking about that at our cabinet committee oncoronavirus thisafternoon.
As you've heard from minister hajdu, from patty and Dr. Tam, and frommr.
Miller and fromdr.
Wong, this is an area that we are very urgently focused on. and we are looking at every single option, every single possibility, whether it is, as patty mentioned yesterday, the possibility of making some of this stuff at home.
Whether it is, you know, various really extraordinary procurement efforts around the world that we are engaged in, and also in being sure that we know what everyone has so we are able to manage surges across thecountry.
and as the prime minister said today, looking at what the military can do and what Minister sajancan do to contribute to that effort is very much apart of it. I hope people understand that from our government'sperspective, this is anall-hands-on-deck effort.
Every single person in thegovernment is involved.
We are being creative, andwe are acting Ind realtimeto respond to this.
As, by the way, I know allcanadians are.



Thank you.
