and that is the Prime Minister of Canada addressing Canadians for the fourth day in a row from his home in Rideau cottage here in the nation's capital where he is now halfway through his own self-isolation with his family.
Let's bring in the host of "power & politics" Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane both here as they have been daily to help us make their way through some of the news that's come from both the Prime Minister and various ministers who will also be speaking shortly.
The biggest bit of news, if there was any there, because I really do think that today was a message of reassurance was around the border which he says these limits to measure nonessential travel between Canada and the United States is probably coming into effect overnight Friday.
So, that is very quick.
Actually, just as quickly as they got the deal done in the first place.
I'll start with you, Vassy.
I mean, I'm not sure what else there was in terms of new information.
But I think the importance of seeing the Prime Minister and him reiterating those key messages is needed by Canadians right now.
