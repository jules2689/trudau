### Summary:



This is how we'll protect Canadians and the economy and it is also a lot to take in. People are having to figure out how they can work from home or close up shop temporarily.
People need to know they have support for their jobs, their businesses, their industries and that is what our government has been focused on since day one.
Yesterday we announced an $82 billion plan that will support all Canadians.
Our team is hard at work with the public service and making sure these new supports get to Canadians as quickly as possible.
They are doing a fantastic job already and I'll have a long discussion with the clerk of the privy council later today to talk about how we can support our public servant and ensure that Canadians can access these new programmes.
But now, with the new support, they can stagger entry to 10 people at a time, extend hours and stock up the food bank.
Their work is focused on developing and implementing measures to detect, manage and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Across the country, scientists and researchers are working extremely hard.
I want to take a moment to specifically thank them for all the essential work they're doing.
Yesterday Dr. Tam said that officials have now tested more than 50, 000 Canadians since the beginning of the outbreak. Ministers hajdu and ministers Freeland will continue to work with the provinces and territories so that everyone has the resources they need.
In times of crisis, Canadians come together.
But until then, I want to let people know that we're working tirelessly to keep our hospitals, health care system and Canadians supported.
On that note, let me take a moment to recognize, again, the incredible work of our nurses, doctors, technicians and other health care professionals.
We need to support them and keep them healthy as well.
But even if you don't work in amend ho, you can still keep people healthy.
Take the right steps, like staying home and working remotely to help flatten the curve and, as you do, know that your government is right there with you.
We're taking steps to support you through tough times.
We know this is a difficult and extraordinary time in which Canadians are taking difficult and extraordinary measures and we will continue to do that until Canadians are safe.

Yes, we are considering using any measures necessary to ensure that Canadians and our health care systems have the supports they need.




As we said, we're going to work very, very hard to bring Canadians home.
It is time for Canadians to come home from around the world.
That is why we sent out a text message to all Canadians overseas with information on how to share their information and get in touch with consular services.
I spoke yesterday with the heads of our two large airlines at west jet and air Canada to talk about how we can work with them to ensure that there are flights to bring Canadians home.
We'll continue to respond to the overwhelming demand by Canadians for support.



We'll be sending money to indigenous communities for them to use the way they need to to keep their communities safe through COVID-19. and support access to supplies they need and get through this difficult situation.
We recognize that indigenous Canadians are faced with greater health and economic challenges that most Canadians, at the best of times.
There is a need for special report and special care for indigenous communities and indigenous across the country.
There will be a press conference later to discuss what we're doing with indigenous Canadians.
We've also taken specific measures on payroll support for small businesses that will be available in the near future.
The help for Canadians will be flowing in the coming weeks.
We recognize that this is a difficult time both in terms of getting these new programmes in place quickly and a enough to help Canadians and that is why I'm going to be working with the public service to ensure that all of our efforts are focused on supporting Canadians through this difficult time.
