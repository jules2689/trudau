Jump in the number of coronavirus infections across this country.
The province has reported nearly 1, 000 new cases just yesterday.
We're now closing in on a total of 6, 000 across this country.
One of cases of those who are now recovered and that number is more than 500, is the Prime Minister's wife.
Sophie gregoire Trudeau thanked the country and well-wishers in an instagram post yesterday.



I want to thank every single person who has reached out to me when I was going through the coronavirus and the symptoms and everything that that includes.
The good news is that I'm -- I have a clear bill of health now.
By medical professionals so I'm super happy.
So, it's all good.
I know it is all good for me now, but there are many, many Canadians and many people who are suffering right now and I want to send you all My love, all My courage.



**Rosemary**:

So a clean bill of health for Sophie gregoire-trudeau, but we know that the Prime Minister and his family continue to practice physical distancing, he continues to work from home and that is why we'll see him come out his front door to bring us up to date on things that the government is doing to contain the pandemic, both economically and from a public health perspective.
Tomorrow was supposed to be the date of the federal budget.
Of course, that date quickly thrown away and now hundreds of billions of dollars have been pumped into the economy through various measures to try and prop it up through this pandemic.
The government really fighting both a war on the public health front, but also trying to settle the economy in the next number of weeks.
There's bring in My colleague, the cbc's david Cochrane now who joins me on this Sunday.
So, we're expecting to hear from the Prime Minister.
Yesterday we did get some more data from the public health agency, david, that perhaps not surprisingly shows that 90% of new cases now are community transmission.
So, if you're in and around the community, and that, of course, is why we are hearing again and again about this practice of physical distancing and how important that is.



**David**:

Yeah.
I think there was an expectation for the numbers to tilt in that direction once we started denying entry to noncanadian citizens and nonessential travel at the Canada-United States border that it would move that way.
It will be interesting what happens in this country over the next week because there were those one million Canadians who came back as either snowbirds or spring breakers that came back from the country in the United States in particular and we're in the timeframe this week where if they do have COVID-19, the symptoms will start to manifest and can start testing positive.
We've seen some of that in Quebec sort of at the foreshadowing of what might happen like Ontario, because their spring break is earlier than Ontario's so this is the week we should be preparing for an increase in those numbers.
We already saw, you know, 211 more cases in Ontario today.
That is a big single-day number for them.
and we can expect more of that tick, tick, tick, tick because for all the talk of closing borders internationally, the biggest risk is Canadians bringing the virus with them from vacation and not following the self-isolation or mandatory quarantine rules.
and that is where, I don't know if they would treat that as a travel-related spread or community spread, but it's still another infection in the case load in a country that right now is taking extraordinary efforts to prepare for the virus to reach its peak.
We have not reached that point in this country.
But this, I think, willable -- will be a critical week in terms of getting those numbers to where we're going to go because of the lag and manifesting of symptoms for people who have come back from the United States specifically.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Tam still thinks at this stage, anyway, that we can handle the capacity in the health care system.
I would point out to people that the number of tests continues to increase.
187, 000 tests now completed.
I'm sure we'll get an update at the noon press conference.
and Ontario who was experiencing a real backlog in terms of result is catching up slowly but surely.
It is doing 4100 tests a day.
Said yesterday that this province is aiming to do 5, 000 a day by early next week and get this -- surging to 19, 000 a day by mid April.
So, that is significant as well.



**David**:

and not to be the voice of doom, but hopefully a voice of context.
We look at the total number of cases just under 6, 000.
The number of infections in the country are invariably higher than that.
There has been an approach to rationing tests to protect vulnerable populations like people in senior homes or in the health sector or testing the truly sick.
a lot of people may have mild symptoms or not considered to be at risk are simply not being tested.
This is something that has been necessitated by the absence of widespread availability of swabs for the nasal tests that we've been using in this country and the not-quite-ready-to go instant tests or rapid tests that need to retool, scale up and be manufactured and then validated by health Canada as effective.
The most important number to look at right now is the number of hospitalizations, number of people in intensive care and the number of deaths in the country.
That gives you an idea sense because those can concretely be measured.
We should know, I mean there are problems with the reporting of data at the national level.
Funneling up from local health authoritis to provincial health authorities to the public health agency of Canada to give a truly precise number.
That is improving bit by bit, day by day as they report its breakdown processes of exactly what the country is dealing with.
That is the number that is really significant at this point in time.
As we saw in Quebec a simple change of presumptive to confirmed cases can lead to a massive spike in the overall number.
The true strain on the system is going to come from the hospitalization, the intensive care patients and obviously the fatal is which right now are at about 63 in this country.
That is the real number to start watching for it and one that we're all pushing health authorities to give us a more realtime and accurate reporting on and just how many people there are in hospital right now.



**Rosemary**:

and just to follow through with that and then turn to the United States.
Hospitalization as of yesterday was at 7%. I. C.u. Was at 3%. and fatalities at 1%. just to put some numbers to that, day.
I'll come back to you shortly as we wait for the Prime Minister.
First I want to turn to the United States.
Because a different situation there.
Cases of COVID-19, they are continuing to grow as the country continues to struggle with enacting substantial testing and just this morning t doctor leading the fight against the pandemic made a sobering statement.



Looking at what we're seeing now, you know, I would say between 100, 000 and 200, 000 cases but I don't want to be held to that because it -- excuse me, deaths.
I mean, we're going to have millions of cases.
By just don't think that we really need to make a projection when it's such a moving target.



**Rosemary**:

That is Dr. Fauci suggesting there that millions of Americans will be infected and deaths could total 100, 000 to 200, 000 people.
Cbc's Katie Simpson join us now from Washington.
Those were stark numbers in a country, Katie, where there has been such a lag in testing.
and that has not obviously helped contain the pandemic.



**Reporter**:

No. and Dr. Anthony fauci in that same interview went on to discuss the only way he will be able to be comfortable with easing of restrictions when different parts of the country are going to have access to rapid testing t. Delay in testing is what is really being blamed for the widespread infection across the United States and Americans really feel at this stage don't have a grasp on the scope of the problem here.
They are seeing those hotspots.
In new York city, in new Orleans, in Detroit is developing very, very quickly as well.
Where the hospital system, the health care system, they are being overwhelmed at this point.
and governors in different states are very concerned that similar scenes will play out in their own districts and their own states and so they are continuing to call for strong enforcement measures and really bringing those measures into effect in their own jurisdictions.
There had been some discussion at the white house.
Donald trump publicly floated he was considering actually enforcing quarantine orders for three states -- for new York, Connecticut and new jersey.
That is where the infection rates are really exploding.
There is not a handle on what is going on. However, after some intense discussion at the white house, ultimately they opted to go with a travel warning from the centers for disease control, asking people in those three states to avoid any nonessential travel unless -- for 14 days unless it is something that is essential.
We have since learned that a push for the quarantine came from the governor of Florida who's had pressure there after he didn't order a closure of beaches as we saw scenes of everyone going to the beaches although there were the social distancing warnings in place.
It was ultimately discussed at the white house at the highest levels and decided not to go with a quarantine order.
Governor Andrew Como who has been a leader in this whole crisis, he is glad that is not the case.
He says that would be an un-american move.
Dr. S anthony fauci said a warning is a better way to go. That is where things stand right now.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Katie Simpson in Washington.
Thank you.
I'm going to go back to David Cochrane, if I can.
We're watching the front door.
The Prime Minister about to emerge in about five minutes' time to update the situation in this country.
Let me remind you of measures that he announced yesterday that will begin to be enforced tomorrow.
As of Monday at noon, if you travel anywhere on a plane or train inside this country, and you present symptoms of COVID-19, you will not be allowed to board.
You remember that the quarantine act was itself or is itself now being enforced.
Also if you come in from outside of this country, you are required to self-isolate, to quarantine yourself for 14 days.
Do we have a sense of what the Prime Minister might be talk about today? I think he was trying to reiterate heading into the weekend the importance of physical disens thating, knowing that that community transmission rate so high.



and travel restrictions yesterday.
With being able to get on planes and trains t two sorts of domestic transportation that the federal government regulates.
Today it's going to be a focus on signaling help and offering help to vulnerable populations.
We've heard the Prime Minister speak quite a few times over the past week about kids and about seniors who are having their lives significantly disrupted and may be at risk because of all of this.
I think today will focus on giving help to charities that would support kids and seniors who might have a level of risk.
Think about the United Way, which is home delivery of meals, for example.
Kids help phone.
Which offers a lifeline to children who may be in a very difficult and stressful situation.
So measures along those lines to get money into the bank accounts of the *ins using -- institutions that would support these people directly and indirectly through meal plans and supporting things like kids help phone.
I know we talked about this helping people in those communities has been a real concern in dealing with this or as money put into shelters, for example, early because of domestic violence and intimate partner violence and kids being abused and forced to stay at home.
In some cases at homes that are unsafe.
There was money put into things like that early in this.
Now is just coping with stress and having food delivered if you are a senior, just maybe has mobility issues or transportation issues and can't get out to get groceries and goat your own food to help with food delivery and things like that, to take some of that pressure off and try to patch yet another hole in the safety net.



Yeah.
Certainly mental health is something that we heard a little bit from the health Minister, patty hajdu saying that I were going to launch a virtual mental health tool.
I don't know if that's happened.
The kids help phone.
There's been a 350% increase in people reaching out.
and it is not surprising during these kinds of pandemics we saw during SARS.
People obviously this takes a a toll on what's happening and this time in particular as we head into sort of the second or third week of people practicing physical distancing, it is difficult and that is why you hear the public health agency talking about the importance of not socially isolating yourself.
I saw the premier of Nova Scotia the other day was providing 800 iPad's to seniors homes because obviously they, too, feeling deeply isolated and that is a smart idea because people are trying to figure out how to stay in touch with loved ones.



**David**:

Stephen McNeil said he saw images of people coming to see grandma and grandpa or mom and dad through the windows and the impractical nature of that given the weather, he wanted to make sure to end the social isolation that people are going through.
This is a humane and kind policy.
and just shows the ingenuity that is happening here.
You know, premiers are doing things like this, ordinary Canadians and celebrities are doing things like this.
a voice of doom earlier and hope now.
My buddy Alan Doyle has a new album out.
He's supposed to be doing concerts across the country and instead he is doing YouTube concerts and raising money for kids help phone and he's raised $100, 000 for them.
You know? in just a matter of baoex.
-- weeks.
You are seeing the scams and you see the people trying to rip people off and the worst of behaviour and people ignoring the health advice.
You are seeing a lot of examples of some of the best of behaviour and real humane, kind efforts from first ministers down to lead sungers.



**Rosemary**:

That's right.
As we wait for the Prime Minister, we have been given the two-minute warning, I want to give people new advice or some clearer advice from the public health agency of Canada.
a lot of you have e-mailed and tweeted me about whether you're allowed to take a walk.
Here is the latest advice on taking a walk.
You can walk outside.
If you have not been diagnosed with COVID-19. That should seem obvious.
If you have no symptoms or COVID-19 and if you have not left Canada in the past 14 days and that is maybe new and we will ask a little bit more about that at the noon press conference when public health officials come out.
But those are the three ways you can go outside.
and we certainly want people to do that because that also helps with our mental health.
This is the Prime Minister of Canada with an update.
