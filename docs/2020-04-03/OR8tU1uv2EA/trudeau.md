**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

It is very difficult for many people.
I understand that.
and we're doing everything we can to help you as a government.
Just this week, we announced new measures to help families, workers and businesses.
But even with that help, I know that things remain difficult.
and for people who were there are trouble, it's even harder.
Staying home, for example, is not always easy.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

For some, physical dis ens hating means juggling, taking care of the kids while trying to get some work done at the kitchen table.
Frankly, that is not everyone's reality.
Far too many people home isn't a safe place to be. For others it's somewhere they're isolated and alone.
For too many more, they have no place to go at all.
Tough times fall first and hardest on the most vulnerable in our communities.
But we can change that.
We can make sure that no one is left without help.
Let me take a moment to speak directly to kids.
I know these past weeks have been tough.
Haven't seen your friends, haven't been able to go to school.
You've been hunkered down with your parents and you're watching the world you know change radically.
The source of anxiety is a source of tension and maybe there's extra tension in your family.
But there are people who can help.
Reach out to kids help phone.
You can call or text them at 686868 or call 800-668-6868 or go online to kidshelpphone.
Ca. They are there to listen.
They're there to support you.
They're there to make sure that you know that you are not alone.
and help you and all of us through this.
No matter where you live, 24 hours a day, seven days a week in french and in English.
Indeed, to make sure that you have the help you need, we're investing $7.5 million for more counselors and trained volunteers with kids help phone.
There are people in your corner making sure you're Ok. and kids, I want to speak with your grandparents now.
Our seniors are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. We all know that and it's for them that so many of us are staying home, self-isolating, are following the rules.
But even if they're safe and isolated, this is not easy on them.
Maybe they're having trouble getting out to go to grocery, to get groceries.
Maybe they're feeling particularly alone.
Maybe they've already been isolated and this is just an extra degree of stress on them.
Well, we have help for them as well.
Minister of seniors, deb shulty, is announcing money to the United Way for everything from health check-ins to grocery delivery.
In fact, the United Way is already stepping up. Here in ottawa, they're helping people like you with things like meal delivery.




**Interpreter**:

Today we are announcing new funds for those that need the most.
I'd just like to take a moment to speak directly to young people.
I know these last few weeks have not been easy for young people.
You can't see your friends, you can't go to school, you can't do all the things that you did before.
and you see the world is changing.
That is a source of stress and and for you and for your family.
Things may not be easy at home either.
But you should know that you can always get help and you're not alone.
Kids help phone is a programme that has been in place for a long time to help children.
You can call, you can go online, you can text a message as well and they will be there to help you.
You can send a text message to 686868 or you can call the help line at 800-668-6868.
Wherever you are, in french or in English, 24/7, there will be someone there to help you.
and to help your family.
and to do even more to help these kids who need assistance, we are releasing $7.5 million to hire more counselors and volunteers.
and for the grandparents of these children, we're thinking about you as well.
We know that COVID-19 is hitting seniors harder and is more of a risk for our seniors.
So you are probably even more isolated than you may be normally.
Maybe you're having trouble getting your shopping done or meeting your own personal needs.
I just want to say that we will be providing help to you.
To help seniors who are vulnerable, we'reoffering $9 million to United Way through the new horizons programme for seniors that.
Will allow this organization to provide a whole range of services to seniors, whether it is a health check-in or delivery services or meal deliveries.
In a country like Canada, no one should be abandoned.
and to help those people who are homeless or fleeing family violence, we are allocating $00 million to shelters.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We promise to help everyone get through this tough time.
We'll work with the organisations you rely on and who will have your back.
Earlier this month, we committed $200 million for shelters.
If you need to get away from domestic violence or violence because of your gender, if you need somewhere to stay, there are places you can go and be safe.
This new funding is already having a huge impact on support for you.
Just take the shelter in Toronto that can now rent additional space to isolate residents with COVID-19 and keep everyone safe.
We'll keep working with charities and nonprofits on this.
On that note, I want to recognize the incredible people who work and volunteer in their communities through these groups.
I know it has been hard lately.
Not just because more and more people need your help, but because you are struggling to keep doing this work for marginalized and vulnerable people during a public health crisis on a scale that Canada has never before seen.
Soon, I'll have a plan to help keep helping Canadians who need it most.
But the bottom line is this.
Whomever you are, whatever you need, we're here for you.
If you are fortunate enough to have a little extra to spare right now, I'm asking you to join in and be part of the solution.
Please, donate to your favourite organisations and find out how you can volunteer if your community.
Even working from home, you can make a real difference in the impact an organization can have.
As an individual, a family, a company, think of how you can lend a hand to help others through this tough time.




**Interpreter**:

We all have a role to play to ensure our health and safety.
As we often say, it is very important for young people to continue to keep a distance of two metres from others.
Stay home and avoid different places in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 as soon as possible.
I know it is harder to stay home during the weekend.
Sometimes you can feel very alone.
But don't forget that we're all coming through this different time together and you just have to look around you to see those signs of solidarity.
Right across this country and around the world.
People are showing that the best days are still ahead.
and if you are in Montreal tonight, look at the Champlain bridge.
It will be lit up with colours of the rainbow.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I know these are hard times, but I also know that we're going to get through them together.
