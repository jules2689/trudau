**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'd like to talk about something different.
Have you received any demand or are there any discussions with respect to having the army intervene? particularly in Quebec where it's possible of shutting down access to the city of Montreal in the coming days? well, we know that the situation is evolving every day and we're ready to consider all eventualities.
We know that Canadians are aware that the Canadian armed forces will always be there to help Canada when Canada needs help.
They are there to serve.
But for now, we have not had any specific requests of that and there is no plan at this time to carry out operations in Canada with the Canadian armed forces.

**Interpreter**:

You said on Friday that you intend to remain at home, even though all of the family is in good health.
is that to give an example to others? can you really be a [inaudible] in leading Canada during this time of crisis by working from home? obviously we're very aware of the fact that Sophie has now received the all-clear.
She no longer has symptoms.
and she went to harrington lake with the children.
But I continue to work from here, as we're asking many Canadians to do. But the fact is, that I was in the same house as someone with COVID-19. and therefore, the countdown will continue because I could theoretically have caught the virus even just a few days ago so I will remain in isolation.
This is something that health can the is recommending and we're saying to people to stay home when you can.
As you can see, I continue to work every single day from home.
We are able to co-ordinate what needs to be coordinated and do the necessary work.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all, I'm very happy, as many people were, to see that Sophie has been given the all-clear.
It has been a few days since she has been symptom-free and obviouslily I want to thank everyone who has sent messages of support.
She's taken the kids to harringtonment I'm going to continue to stay here to do the work that needs to be done.
Up to a few days before she was clear, I was still sharing the roof, but share ago roof with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. So I have to continue in ice solation in order to be sure that we're following all the protocols and recommendations by health Canada, and the work continues as a government.
There are lots of companies and organisations around the country that are discovering that you can do a lot of work via telephone and video conferences and that is exactly what I'm doing and will continue to do as so many Canadians are doing as well.



Thank you.
Next question.



**Reporter**:

Merci.
Thank you.
Hi. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what help you will be providing to chair is. I know several hundred of them made a plea last week for help to be able to continue, I think you hinted that there is something coming.
Can you give more reassurances of the charities that are so relied upon right now will get some help?



Today we have an announcement for Khmer ta bl and nonprofit organisations specifically that have been doing a great work and helping out youth and our seniors.
The nonprofit sector is doing incredibly important work during incredible times and they're seeing their donations Dr. up and they're very worried about their capacity to continue to do the work they're doing.
That's why we're working closely with them and we'll have announcements to make in the coming days about how we're going to ensure that we can continue to do this incredible work so important for Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Are you concerned at all that you're putting too much pressure on airline staff, check-in staff, people at the train stations to screen people for COVID-19?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We already know that an awful lot of people are not traveling, have listened to the recommendations to stay home, to avoid nonessential travel.
This is extremely important and from the very beginning we told people that if you have COVID-19 symptoms, you need to stay home.
You should not travel.
You must not go out.
That is going to continue to be the instructions we give but we also asked airline and train staff to ensure that nobody with symptoms boards their planes or trains.



Thank you, next question.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Just along the same lines, you say that you don't need the Canadian armed forces for the imtoo being.
But do you not think that very soon that might be helpful and necessary assistance, particular will I when we see what's happening in Quebec, in Montreal, which is a big part of the province? and so that people stop traveling? well, the Canadian armed forces will always be there to help people who need help.
We are ready and looking at various scenarios through which we could provide that additional help.
But we're not at that stage yet.
We will continue our discussions with the provinces.
and with the various regions of the country.
To ensure that we can do what is necessary.
We are not shutting the door on any possible scenario.
But we are making decisions as the situation arise.
and My next very brief question is should we start counting your 14-day period from today? well, I think that's one way of counting it. Maybe a few days left because Sophie stopped having symptoms a few days ago.
But we will keep you aware of how long we'll continue to hold these press conferences.



Thank you.
Next question.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
You announced a whole lot of different funds and measures for small businesses.
But, you know a lot of small businesses are having trouble navigating through what you have announced in terms of tax deferrals, wage subsidies, credit availability, that sort of thing.
Are you considering making it easier for people to access the funding that they can access and getting the funding to the right people?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are doing an awful lot of things that have never been done before by any government in this country.
Never been a reason to. and as we're developmenting new policy solutions, new ways of helping out people so that we can get through this time and come out the other end of it stronger than ever before, we need to, you know, really figure out both what those things are and to ensure that people will be able to access them.
We are putting out as much information as we can about the different options and I recommend people go to Canada.
Ca to be able to find more information about it. I know their organisations, whether it is the cfib or banks themselves that are giving advice around these new measures were coming in. But we'll continue to communicate as best we possibly can so that everyone is able to access the help that's there for them.
I recognize the challenge and we'll continue working on it.



**Reporter**:

and Prime Minister



-- >> Prime Minister trudeau: 



**Interpreter**:

I recognize that we're doing a great many things that are new, we're introducing new programmes and that this can be difficult to find out the help that they need and navigate these new programmes.
That is why we'll continue to try and provide all the necessary information to Canadians and businesses so that they can access the help that they deserve.
At the same time, they're meeting with other organisations and banks as well to ensure that information about the assistance that is available can be accessed by those who need it.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, there have been numerous reports that prisons are a particular concern.
Prisoners are concerned about



The >> Natasha's in place to protect them from the outbreak if it reaches prisons in Canada.
What do you say to prisoner whos are concerned right now that they're dealing with one bar of soap er week and no other countermeasures?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We're very concerned about the fact that our correctional institutions could be places where there is -- are places where there could be greater vulnerability to COVID-19. That is why we've been working have closely with corrections Canada and I know Minister bill Blair, public safety Minister, will have more to say on this.
This is something that we're digging into very carefully because we need to make sure that we're keeping everyone safe in this country.




**Interpreter**:

I realised that our correctional facilities are more vulnerable than other facilities to the outbreak of COVID-19. So we'll continue to work with corrections Canada and Minister Blair to ensure that we're doing whatever is necessary to keep everyone safe.



Thank you.
Now to questions in the room.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, this morning you made a small announcement with regards to seniors and giving money to charity groups there.
What about those on fixed incomes, seniors who have watched their en vestments and their retirement savings dwindle away on the markets? are we going to see any increases to c. P.p. Or other provisions for them like you've offered to workers in small businesses?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Our focus has been to figure out how to decide to replace sources of revenue that have been lost because of COVID-19 for so many Canadians across the country who were relying on their pay cheques to get through from week-to-week until this actually hit.
But we recognize that seniors are facing greater vulnerability and we're looking carefully at measures to be able to support them through this tough time as well.



**Reporter**:

and the dutch government has sent back 600, 000 masks to china that they deemed were defective.
I'm wondering when will we receive the masks that china said they will send to us and what assurances do we have that they will be effective and have we seen a thaw in our relationship with china in the course of this crisis?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We will be receiving equipment, masks and gowns and gloves from china extremely shortly, in the coming days.
and at the same time, I can assure people that health Canada has very strong procedures for evaluating, for ensuring that what we get is up to the necessary standards and there will be no corners cut on this one.
We need to make sure that the equipment that our health care workers are relying to keep them safe as they keep us safe is of a quality that is going to actually do the job and we'll continue to engage with the world and try to work collaboratively through this difficult time.
It is a global pandemic.
and countries need to set aside their differences and work together to get us through this as best as possible and that is certainly the approach that we're taking.



Prime Minister, in the case of the quantities teen act and also in the case of the measures announced for travelers yesterday there's been no clear information about enforcement for those who make the rules and yesterday in Ontario we saw a snitch line for price gougers.
I'm wondering if you can provide more information about enforcement in general and also wondering are you encouraging other Canadians to report other Canadians who aren't following the rules to local authoritis?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all , it is very important that we all follow the rules.
What we have been doing and will be doing over the coming days will have a direct impact on whether or not Canada is able to make it through this crisis in the best possible way.
It will have a direct impact on our health care workers.
What we're choosing to do right now, these weeks, will affect deeply whether and how we get through this crisis.
I impress upon everyone to self-isolate and follow the rules and make sure that we're not putting ourselves or our neighbours or communities at risk.
Health Canada does follow up with people in terms of respecting quarantine.
That's an important part of what we do. and I would really encourage Canadians to don't spread the message, share with each other how important it is to continue to stay home.



I'd like the ask you to respond to reports that we're hearing about how truck drivers deemed essential workers are being treated when they cross the border, not having access to washrooms or restaurants and some being made to stay in their trucks.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are very concerned with the need to continue essential services and that includes obviously supply chains that are so important for keeping people fed, keeping people with the medications they need through this difficult time.
We continue to work with folks at the border to ensure that this smooth flow and respectful support for these essential workers happens.
At the same time as we're ensuring safety for our citizens.
It is always a challenging balance to establish, but we need to keep working to make sure that we can continue to get these essential ed goo's while people are taking risks by continuing their essential work.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

I'd like to come back to what you said two days ago with respect to scenarios involving the c. a.f. Particularly in montreal.
Can you give us more details on that? from the very beginning, we have been preparing based on various scenarios places where COVID-19 will hit much harder or various regions that might be experiencing particular difficulties.
Our canadian armed forces will bawls there to help Canadians and I know we have [inaudible] to help when flooding has occur in the past.
They will always be there for that and we'll continue to work with the regional and provincial authorities and the city of montreal and cities right across the country to resfonld emergency situations that could arise.
But we will not theorize before we get to a time where we have to move forward with more extensive measures.
We are taking things one day at a time be prepared for any eventuality.
Could you talk about specific scenarios? can we say whether this would apply only to Quebec or whether there are other provinces who have been discussing this as well? in terms of bringing in the army? well, we'll always respond to any request from the province if they want help from the federal government.
But I can't say which one would or would not.
But we will be there to meet any needs expressed by Canadians or the provinces to keep everyone safe during this difficult and exceptional period.



Thank you.
We have time for one more question.



**Reporter**:

Ashley Burke, CBC news.
Prime Minister, there are towns and cities across the country who are preparing arenas and community centres to prepare them into makeshift hospitals, if needed.
What does that tell you about where we are in the arc of this crisis and what does it tell Canadians about their



Hospital's capacity in >> Prime Minister Trudeau it is a message that we're preparing for any every possibility.
We're hopeful that the activity that people have engaged in will keep numbers to a manageable level for people who need hospitalization and that is why we're working extremely hard to encourage everyone to stay home and to not risk spreading this virus further.
That is how we control the spread.
Our health care systems are designed to function as close to capacity in normal situations.
Day in and day out, we need our hospitals to be able to handle normal surges, whether it's flu season or after an accident or an illness, we have a health system that works pretty well to handle the needs in regular time.
These are not regular times and, therefore, it is appropriate and necessary that we look at how to expand our health system to handle unprecedented numbers.
In an undress den ed crisis.
and I want to commend all the people who are looking at alternatives that we all hope we won't need but, indeed, we will not need if people continue to take seriously the directives and stay home and self-isolate.
But it is simply responsible for us to be thinking about worst-case scenarios and preparing for them just in case we do need them.



**Reporter**:

There's been a huge wave of snow birds and spring breakers returning to Canada and the potential that we'll see a surge because of that.
How prepared is Canada's health care system to deal with that surge?



Prime Minister Trudeau's this is why we are impressing upon everyone how important it is that if you returned from travel that you isolate for 14 days.
It is extremely important that everyone isolates and there have been a few questions recently about, well, does that mean I can go for a walk if I keep separates from people by two metres.
It's very simple.
According public health Canada, you can go for a walk unless you have tested positive for COVID-19. Unless you have symptoms of COVID-19. Or unless you have returned from overseas or outside the country within 14 days.
and when you do go outside, make sure you don't have any of those three categories, make sure that you are keeping your distance.
Don't gather in groups in parks.
Keep those distance.
If you are in quarantine or self-isolation, and you need some fresh air, open a window or step outside on to your stoop if that is a private place.
But really, we need people to be abiding by the rules that public health has put out, particularly people who have returned from travel outside the country.



**Reporter**:

Can the health care system deal with the surge?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are ensuring that we're able to deal with the surge.
People are putting situations -- putting emergency braeshs in place, but we are hoping that there won't a surge because we have seen other areas overwhelmed, even if they have strong health care systems, that's why it's so important that everyone abide by the instructions given.
Merci.
