### Summary:







For some, physical dis ens hating means juggling, taking care of the kids while trying to get some work done at the kitchen table.
Far too many people home isn't a safe place to be.
We can make sure that no one is left without help.
I know these past weeks have been tough.
You've been hunkered down with your parents and you're watching the world you know change radically.
But there are people who can help.
Reach out to kids help phone.
They're there to make sure that you know that you are not alone.
and help you and all of us through this.
Indeed, to make sure that you have the help you need, we're investing $7.5 million for more counselors and trained volunteers with kids help phone.
There are people in your corner making sure you're Ok. We all know that and it's for them that so many of us are staying home, self-isolating, are following the rules.
Well, we have help for them as well. Here in ottawa, they're helping people like you with things like meal delivery.




We promise to help everyone get through this tough time.
Just take the shelter in Toronto that can now rent additional space to isolate residents with COVID-19 and keep everyone safe.
We'll keep working with charities and nonprofits on this.
On that note, I want to recognize the incredible people who work and volunteer in their communities through these groups.
I know it has been hard lately.
Not just because more and more people need your help, but because you are struggling to keep doing this work for marginalized and vulnerable people during a public health crisis on a scale that Canada has never before seen.
Soon, I'll have a plan to help keep helping Canadians who need it most.
Even working from home, you can make a real difference in the impact an organization can have.
As an individual, a family, a company, think of how you can lend a hand to help others through this tough time.




I know these are hard times, but I also know that we're going to get through them together.
