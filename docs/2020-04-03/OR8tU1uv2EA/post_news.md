**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada giving us yet another update on the COVID-19 pandemic in this country.
It was good to hear the advice about walking.
That advice seems to have shift ad lib and hopefully we'll hear more about that from the noon press conference.
As well, after his wife Sophie gregoire-trudeau has now got the all-clear on her health, she and the three children have made the decision to go to harrington lake, which is the private residence of the Prime Minister in gatineau, not far from the nation's capital.
The Prime Minister says because he has been living with someone who, up until a few days ago was presenting symptoms of COVID-19, he will continue to self-isolate at home and work from home.
All right.
But there was other news there as well.
Let me bring in the cbc's david Cochrane here in ottawa on that part, david?



**David**:

Yeah, rosey.
Two specific announcements today from the Prime Minister with the promise of more to come.
Specifically for the charity sector.
Right off top, $7.5 million to the kids help phone to hire more counselors and trained volunteers to help young people who are dealing with the stress and difficulty of what is happening here and around the world.
People that they can reach out to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, who can offer them advice and support and counseling, especially acute for kids, for example, who can be in a house where things aren't necessarily going so well at the best of times and those challenges are exacerbated at the worst of times.
So, direct programme help there for children and $9 million to the United Way to help seniors.
In particular to expand programmes that do health check-ins on seniors who may live alone and ma I be isolated and to facilitate meal deliveries for people who can't necessarily leave to buy their own groceries or may not have the ability to prepare their own food based on what their own circumstances are.
I mean, rosey, there is also talk about the need to expand help for shelters, to deal with people who are in abusive ising somewhats, to create isolation shelters for homeless people who may not have a home to go to or people whose homes may not be safe and need somewhere to go during these difficult times.
While we've been talk about the health numbers and strain on the health system, the economic supports for people as the economy essentially goes into total lockdown, just how much the cracks widen in a society under stress like this.
and the day by day efforts to try to patch these things up. It is remarkable to look at how the government is functioning.
Not to say it's remarkable like they've done a wonderful job and everything because there will be problems along the way.
Normally the programmes of the size and scale that are rolled out are done over weeks and months f not a year.
and here we're rolling out large scale income support and wage six dids and interest-free loans and charity support in a matter of hours and days with a federal bureaucracy that is working from home, working remotely and under significant strain with a Prime Minister who's himself in self-isolation because this has directly affected his family.
The pace and enormity of what they're trying to do here is quite significantly and most of the things we focus on are in the billions of dollars.
These smaller measures are in the millions of dollars to target these more specific things happening below the surface of the large scale health crisis and macro economic crisis.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for that.
As we tack about the Prime Minister there giving more money, particularly for kids help phone.
Let me tell you some recent statistics.
They're getting more than 2, 000 phone calls or texts a day.
and they are hoping to hire 100 -- or to get 100 new volunteers trained each week for the next six weeks.
So this is a need that is happening out there in the country, particular Lu for kids and the Prime Minister had a message for them today.
We reached Raymond abdul-rahman, a ph. DH. in winnipeg, My hometown, good to see you and director of clinical psychology in man toe batch obviously some recognition from the Prime Minister today that this is putting a strain, perhaps particularly on young kids but really everybody.
Can we start with kids? I'm not sure if that is your area of expertise.
But obviously kids are dealing with this differently.
Have different levels of understanding of what's going on. What kinds of things should be happening for kids right now?



I think it is nice to see that measure being taken to help with the kids help line.
But we've had a problem with mental health in our health system for a long period of time.
My first recommendation is generally to the government that we need to be looking at putting money toward behavioral health and clinical psychologists because the issues that arid from this pandemic are not just going to be simple issues of coping with mild to moderate anxiety.
There is going to be an uptake, not just with children, but with adults who have significant problems related to anxiety and mood disorders.
It's important that we put our money with our mouth is.



**Rosemary**:

and we saw after SARS back in 2003, that this was an issue, it did increase and there were people self-harming, all kinds of things that you wouldn't imagine could flow from a pandemic because you're worried about the public health issues, but there is also this pressure on society and on people who are trying to stay away from other people.
What might you expect in terms of some of those -- the fallout from all of this in terms of mental health.



Psychologists across the country or mental health practitioners across the country are seeing a rise in a lot of difficulties.
Measures that we typically use to treat things like o. C.d. Or depression don't always work.
Our mental health can have two influence.
It could be genetics and predisposition but also our circumstances.
and our circumstances right now are quite uncertain and quite difficult.
Psychologists do have ways of overcoming that.
Behaviorally.
We need to look to ways to overcome that while we're self-isolating.



**Rosemary**:

Can you give Canadians the couple of best tips that they could use right now as they're struggling into their second week of hanging out with family or just in their homes by themselvess?



The one most important tip I would offer is making sure you're staying connected with people.
Although we're social distancing, we're v to make sure we're not socially isolating.
We've benefit encouraging people to minimize screen time, now is the time to increase it if we're using it to connect with other people.
That said, we have a complex situation because, after a period of time, people can get tired of being with family and that is the honest truth so we have to try to replicate the circumstances in situations we had prior to the social isolation or social distancing.
Where we need to be able to have those, we need to be able to take breaks from each other and communicate with our co-workers and other people so when we do return to connecting with our family and our partners, we feel a little bit more refreshed.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Good advice, doctor.
Thank you so much.
I hope Canadians are listening to that smart advice on how to get through all of this and cope with it. That for your time.
Stay healthy.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

As we've been taunting about cases in the United States continue to surge.
a warning today from the United States top doctor on this, that millions will be infected in the United States and hundreds of thousands could die.
So, what s a it like on the front lines and American hospitals? Jenna maloche is a Canadian just outside Windsor and she is one of those essential workers that's cos the border to work in a hospital in Detroit.
Jenna, good to see you.



Hi. Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

We reached out because you put this Facebook post on up and some pictures which we'll also show of you in your pro eke thieve gear.
-- in your protective gear, really eking female stay home.
Give us a sense of what you're dealing with every day in Detroit because I know Detroit, the numbers are going up there, too.



Yeah.
The past few weeks, I've had many COVID-19 patients myself and My unit has taken on a lot as well.
So I think that's something that people really need to understand is that when patients come in to the hospital with COVID-19, their family members are not allowed to be at their side with them because of how infectious this virus is. So they're not allowed to see their family members unless they withdraw care so this is how it was the last time I was at work.
So a few days ago.
and it is something difficult to watch and it is something that people really need to know is it is important to stay home.
It is important to wash your hands and practice social dis ens hating because of all of these measures put into the hospital and nobody wants to hurt their family members.



**Rosemary**:

Can you tell me what it is like for you and, again, I think we have some pictures of the enormous amount of gear you are wearing.
But how you prepare and then what happens when you leave work and you get home?



As a unit, we started doing a morning prayer together.
That is something that really brings us together as a team.
It shows how much we support each other.
and recognizes with each other how difficult it is. We talk about our feelings and our thoughts if we need them.
It is something that's very difficult personally for me to have to convey messages from families over the phone to their loved ones because they are not allowed to be there.
It is a stressful time in history.
and it sad en us sometimes.
We do have some bright moments.
We try to brighten things up whenever we can to keep that morale up. But we keep chugging along at this point.



**Rosemary**:

When you go back across the border, because this is something people will wonder, because you are considered an essential worker, what happens when you cross? do they ask if you have symptoms and what happens when you go home to make sure you protect others?



So, about a week ago, a glaring difference in crossing the border for me was instead of opening the window like the border guards usually do, they speak through a speaker to you to protect themselves.
So, that is, in My head, was like -- it was something for me that screened how serious the situation was, even for myself.
Someone who works in it. So they ask us questions like do you know that you're expected to -- that you've been in a foreign country and expected to isolate for 14 days and we would say yes.
They ask us if we've had a fever, cough, sore throat, any of the symptoms of COVID-19. and, of course, I have not had any symptoms myself.
But when I'm home, I wear a mask around My family and do everything I can to protect My friends and family.
So, for me the border is doing a great job of screening people.
They try to get to the bottom of where you've been and everything like that.
Yeah.
The border has definitely been different lately.



**Rosemary**:

Are you, after reading your post and seeing those pictures of you, are you scared? are you ever frightened and just don't want to do it?



I think you have to give yourself a little mirror pep talk in the morning before you go into work.
The way I view it is I have the luxury of helping these people get through the most difficult time in their lives and family's life.
If I can help in that situation, somebody has to do it. Why can't it not be me and that is the main reason why My mom, My sister, great aunt and a lot of My friends got into nursing is the opportunity to help these people through really difficult times.
So I feel grateful.



**Rosemary**:

Well, we're grateful to you and I'm sure all the people in Detroit are, too.
You're very brave.
Stay healthy and thank you for all the work you're doing.
Appreciate it.



Thank you so much for talking to me.



**Rosemary**:

That is jenny meloche who is dealing with the pandemic on the front lines in Detroit.
All of you, extraordinary.
We're going to leave you now on the main network.
You can watch our continuing coverage on CBC news network and CBC.
Ca. a reminder that the Prime Minister announced a few new measures to help the most vulnerable this this country.
Whether it be kids or seniors to make sure that everybody is taking good care during extraordinary times.
More at a press conference at noon.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Thank you for watching.
Take care.



**Rosemary**:

I might circle back to something that was asked of the Prime Minister by My colleague Ashley Burke which was is the country ready for a surge.
The number of cases will increase.
Everyone has said hissed going to get worse before it gets better.



**David**:

Yes, everyone is looking at the daily case updates.
There was a creation of slack in the healthcare system by moving people up to get them done quickly or cancelling elective procedures trying to free up bed capacities and procure supplies.
There are other things happeningnow, the procurement of extra space, this piece-by-piece expansion of the health system and social safety net support system by grabbing whatever public space they can.
That could be in an arena, a warehouse, even a hotel to try to deal with the crisis.
We saw this several weeks ago inquÉbec where they started askingfor several thousand hotel roomsto see if they could be made available to put people who needed to be monitored and looked after but didn't necessarily need to be hospitalized.
They wanted hospital rooms with no carpet and with catering available so it could become a make-shift ward for less-seriousthings, like a knee fracture or an injury like that.
We've seen those measures going on. Now municipal leaders trying to procure extra space for isolation centres, homeless people, or extra emergency shelters nor people who have to flee at an unsafe situation in their home when we're asking everyone to stay home.
We know with intimate partner violence, it's not always safe to stay home.
It's an expansion of the public safety net and whatever servicesare available.
We've seen through the testing centres and the drive-thru centres to move the risk out of the hospital so you're not goingto the emergency room and potentially infecting people at a COVID-19-specific facility rather to deal with this crisis.
All of this is to keep the pressure off the system, keep people out of the beds and out of the ventilators as much as we can to avoid those nightmare scenarios we're seeing in other countries.



**Rosemary**:

David, thank you.
I'll come back to you.
Let's go live to the press conference.
Cabinet ministers and public health officials.



[voice of interpreter] here in this room and over the phone because they also play an essential role in informing and guiding us through this crisis.
From a personal standpoint, we would like to thank them for all of their personal and professional sacrifices in this crisis.
We also want to thank you for your patience because clearly we are in an emergency situation and it is not always possible or even easy to answer all of the relevant questions that you may have.
[end of translation] thank you to all Canadians watching now.
We all have a responsibility to protect our health and the health of our loved ones in this particular crisis, and that starts with following the important physical distancing measures that you have heard and that you will keep hearing because they help protect your health and the health of everyone that you care for.
Thank you also to the reporters present in this room yesterday as well as those on the phone.
We understand that your role is absolutely essential in this crisis to inform and to guide us. We understand also that your personal and professional sacrifices that you are making in the current situation.
Everything is going very fast.
It is not always possible to provide the important answers that you expect from your important questions as quickly as you would normally need and deserve to get them, but we thank you also for your patience.
 [voice of interpreter] this morning we'll be hearing from Minister hussainand then followed by a presentation by Dr. Tam.
Dr. Njoo will also be here.
[end of translation] Mr. Hussain.



Thank you very much, ministerduclos, and welcome to all of you.
Although COVID-19 is affecting all of us as Canadians, certain communities and individuals are particularly vulnerable to it. As a result of that, we have to ensure that our response pays a particular attention to those individuals.
It is in that vein that just very recently the prime minister announced the additional investment of $7.5 million to --in funding to kids' help phone to provide young people with the supports that they need at this difficult time.
This will allow for the hiring of more counsellors to help those young people as well as more volunteers.
In addition to that, the Prime Minister announced that the government of Canada will contribute $9 million through the United Way Canada for local organizations to provide really important services for seniors.
 [voice of interpreter] homeless people in Canada are already dealing with significant health problems.
COVID-19 could worsen things.
[end of translation] this is a population as a community that already faces significant healthchallenges.
The COVID-19 crisis is threatening to exacerbate those challenges already.
Shelters across the country are facing additional pressures, providing Canadians with room toself-isolate, for example, whileat the same time dealing with some of the challenges that are also being faced by other non-profit and charitable organizations, challenges such as a drop in revenues, a drop inthe number of volunteers available.
Shelters traditionally have always worked tirelessly to provide temporary housing to those in most need of temporary housing in Canada.
Today they find themselves working under unforeseen pressures and we can't allow them to face this challenge alone.
That is why we're investing an additional $157 million through the reaching home program and anadditional $50 million targeted directly to women's shelters.
This money will be in addition to the $15 million that we rushed out very quickly in the last number of days to the most impacted communities in Canada.
The important thing about this $150 -- $7.5 million investment is that it is flexible.
It will allow the designated communities to use this money inresponse to COVID-19. They can use it for prevention and also for management of any outbreaks.
This money can be used to procure personal protective equipment, it can be used to buybarriers for social distancing, it can be used to procure additional space in hotels and motel rooms in order to isolate individuals when they're infected with COVID-19. and I wanted to acknowledge the public health agency of Canada for issuing really important guidelines, to providers of services for people experiencinghomelessness.
This was a very important step taken by the public health agency of Canada to help protectfrontline staff that serve the most vulnerable in our communityevery single day.
The money that we are announcingtoday will also help the shelters procure medical services and medical equipment.
This money is already making a difference in many, many communities across the country.
In the coming days we will provide additional details aboutwhere this money is going and how it will be helping holes individuals.
We will continue to work with this really important sector to ensure that they have the resources they need to get through this.
Myself and My parliamentary secretary adam vaughan have beenholding meetings with organizations that serve the homeless population right acrossthe country.
I have been in nearly daily contact with many mayors from across the country.
My message to those working on the frontlines is this, we are here for you and help is on the way.
I also want to take a moment to thank our provincial partners onhelping with housing.
As you know, we acted very quickly to make sure effective March 15 that it is easier for Canadians to get a deferral on their mortgage payments if they're facing difficulties as aresult of COVID-19. It is My understanding that all 10 provinces have now also ensured that those who have losttheir jobs as a result of COVID-19 and are having difficulties paying their rent will not have to worry about being evicted.
This is great news as we move towards the end of the month.
These are difficult times for usall, but the government of Canada and our partners have your back.
We want to protect everyone, allcanadians, especially the most vulnerable.
We are in this together.
Thank you.



Dr. Tam.



In Canada there are now 5, 866cases, including 63 deaths.
In addition, at any point in time, there are many other people under investigation awaiting lab results or not yet tested.
So again, I'm trying to emphasize that even if you are not hearing of cases in your community, that doesn't mean there are no cases or that there are no exposures waiting to happen.
We have now completed tests for over 205, 000 people in Canada, with about 3% of people then confirmed as positive and over 90% confirmed as negative.
Of the over 5, 000 cases, we now know approximately 6% to 7% required hospitalization and about 3% are critically ill and around 1% have been fatal.
Please note that this is real-time data and this data canfluctuate as and when the provinces report this information publicly, as you've seen them do so over the course of the day.
The age group breakdowns, however, are only available for a subset of cases.
This information comes from moredetailed case reports which are less timely.
So at the moment, the information we have for age groups of patients hospitalized is only available for about a quarter of all cases.
Yesterday I misspoke regarding the percentage of hospitalized patients who are under 40 years of age.
The correct figure is approximately 12%, but that's fluctuating around the 9% to 12%mark.
The point, though, that I was trying to make and emphasize wasthat younger people can experience illness severe enoughto require hospitalization.
So that's the message.
 [voice of interpreter] snowbirds are returning from outside of canadamust respect the mandatory quarantine in place.
You are required to go home and stay in your home for 14 days.
Urban dwellers should avoid heading to cottages and rural places, as these places have less capacity to manage COVID-19. Given the need for all of us to stay in our 2-metre bubble, evenour most important religious observances, such as easter and ramadan, will need to be adapted.
I ask all religious leaders to be part of team Canada's effortson physical distancing to help us plank the curve of this epidemic.

Thank you.



[voice of interpreter] thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
We can move to questions now.
Goodday.
We'll start the question period.
[end of translation] we have two questions on the phone.
We'll do two questions on the phone and then two questions in the room and then go back to thephone.



Thank you, Merci.
Please step star 1 on your telephone key pad if you have a question.
The first question is from lindadibb from Canadian press." your line is open.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] this is Lina, not Linda.
[end of translation] My question is for you about the money you were announcing for the homeless.
First, I don't -- maybe I lost count because there's been so many announcements.
Are you saying that this 157 plus 50 is brand new today and it's on top of another 50 that you announced earlier?



**Answer**:

Very good question.
The regular federal anti-homeless program is called "roach -- reaching home." that program is funded on an annual basis.
That money will still flow on April 1. This is top-up money to help specifically with the challengesfaced by the community entities serving homeless individuals, helping them with the challenge of COVID-19, enabling them to prevent the outbreak and also manage any outbreaks in that population.
So in the -- it is new money, yes.

---

**Question**:

New on top of what you had -- I thought you announced already money for homeless and for shelters, actually, a few days ago.



**Answer**:

This is that money, but it is new money in the context of COVID-19. and the additional $15 million that we rushed out of the door for the most impacted communities, that is on top of the money that I am also talking about today.



Thank you, Minister.
Next question, please.



Thank you.
Merci.
The next question is from MIA Robson from "the Canadian press." your line is open.

---

**Question**:

This is a question for Dr. Tam I think.
I'm wondering if you could talk to Canadians about this explosion of people trying to offer homemade face masks and whether or not you think these are recommended, if they can be -- if they're any good use of them or whether people should avoid them.
If you could talk about the building of temporary hospital sites in various provinces and what sort of federal coordination is underway on that.



**Answer**:

So on the question ofmasks, first of all, we ask that people with symptoms cover up their cough or cover up their sneezes.
So it can be with a Kleenex or sometimes if you don't have that, a tissue, then cough into your sleeve.
So masks can be helpful for people who are symptomatic in reducing the spread of droplets.
So that's the concept.
Of course, if you're in healthcare settings those masks are regulated by health Canada so that there's a standard that people have to meet for that sort of purpose.
Health Canada has issued guidance in terms of alternatives that can be used for different -- those kind of purposes.
So I certainly encourage people who are making masks for different purposes to consult the health Canada guidance on the website.



Mia, one follow up?

---

**Question**:

Sorry, these are people who are making homemade masks, sewing groups and things for people because it's not easy to get masks.
But I also wanted you to talk about the building of temporary hospital sites in convention centres and if there's any coordination with the federal government on that work.



**Answer**:

I'm aware that around the federal-provincial-territorial table there is a lot of efforts in preparing the hospitals but also the surge sites.
So this is underway already in the different jurisdictions, andthat is the provincial jurisdictions.
Of course the federal governmentcan provide support as needed and that's always open.
So there are certainly guidance, but we also issue for alternative care sites.



We will turn to the room.

---

**Question**:

Mackenzie grey fromctv.
a few days ago you said Canada has 5, 000 ventilators, but when we look to the United States we see governor Como saying potentially new York state needs30, 000 ventilators.
With your best estimates, how many ventilators do you think Canada will need through this crisis?



**Answer**:

I can answer that.
Certainly the number we gave earlier was based on an estimate that was done with sort of a look around the country at that time.
Obviously it's ever growing.
At the present time we're undertaking another inventory with the provinces and territories to determine how many ventilators we actually have across the country.
In terms of scenario planning, it's difficult to say what the number of ventilators is needed because, as I stated earlier, what we're planning to do is to prepare the system so we won't have to have that peak requirement for a certain number of ventilators at one time.
As we said, we want to flatten the curve.
Therefore, all the steps we're taking across the country are aimed at that.
For example, hospitals are now preparing in terms of trying to empty beds by looking at alternative sites for patients who don't need critical care.
They're looking at bringing back retired physicians.
They're looking at all sorts of measures to better prepare the system.
But if we as Canadians, all of us, practice physical distancing, then what's hopefully anticipated is that let's say, for example, in a given area you might need 1, 000 ventilators, if those patients are spread over a number of weeks and months rather than oneweek, we won't need that many ventilators and it won't overburden the healthcare system.
That's what we're aiming for.

---

**Question**:

We're going to need more than the 5, 000 that we havenow?



**Answer**:

Certainly the federalgovernment, we're in the process of ordering -- actually purchasing additional ventilators so that we can provide surge capacity across the country.
Of course it depends -- one area might need it more than another.
So we certainly have it ready and we're ready to deploy as needed.



I was just going to say that we pre-emptively ordered an additional 600 but continue to order more.
I think a little while ago therewas an announcement of looking at domestic capacity of manufacturers in Canada, so engaging key manufacturers such as thornhill and those are ongoing discussions to get access to the inventory as we speak.



Next.

---

**Question**:

Ashley Burke, CBC news.
You've been talking about how there are enough medical supplies in Canada and how you are prepared, but there is a bit of a disconnect happening because we're hearing from front line workers that they're reusing masks and rationing other medical supplies like masks.
What is the disconnect there?



**Answer**:

Well, I think personal protective equipment, including masks, are a really critical resource for which there is absolutely supply issues globally.
So it's not Canada in particular, but globally, which is why we're pulling out all stops to try to get access to whatever we have.
That is a process which is actively going on right now.
At the same time, responding to a pandemic is also about handling and prioritizing your most critical and scarce resources.
Hospitals on the front line are practices how they can make sure that they can reduce the burn rate and not waste resources as well.
I think you're seeing some of that practice going on pre-emptively because you can't burn through a lot of personal protective equipment.
So it's the effort to preserve them as much as possible while we're still getting some more.

---

**Question**:

As well, there's a lot of snowbirds that have been returning to Canada and as well people that were away on vacations.
Are we expecting to see that church come soon and is Canada'shealthcare system prepared for potential surge if people don't heed your advice and stay home?



**Answer**:

I think that's a very, very important concern andthat's why our message today that for snowbirds, we have a mandatory quarantine on an emergency order right now.
So as you cross that international border, you're asked to respect that and the penalties are substantial if you do not.
But it's working also with local jurisdictions because they are concerned about snowbirds and other returning travellers and concern that they may not be listening to that message, which is why at every level we're trying to reach the population.
Any influx of a group of persons, whether from a cruise ship or returning travellers like the snowbirds is that we have to be really, really vigilant and do the rapid case identification contact tracing.
If someone is actually staying in their home for that 14 days where the incubation period occurs, that is a fundamental public health measure which is why you have to stay home.
At the same time, of course given the various influxes of, say, March break returnees that are still coming back or snowbirds, hospitals are still trying to prepare for that surge by essentially emptying out a lot of their hospital beds and their I. C.u. a number of hospitals have reduced the I. C.u. Occupancy rate by 50% already, just preparing ahead for any blips incases as a result of those travellers.



Merci.
Dr. Tam.
 [voice of interpreter] back to the phone for three questions.
[end of translation].



The next question is from Philip fousie from "radio-Canada." your line is open.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] the question is for Mr. Duclos.
As to the situation, this morning, the Prime Minister announced some funding for vulnerable people.
There could be problems coming up in the next few days and months.
One of the sources of anxiety is that people are wondering whether the government can help them.
So there are a number of questions that remain unclear.
People say, if I work five hours day at a grocery store becausei'm still essential, do I still qualify for the $2, 000 from the government? when I sign up, will the internet site crash? will I receive that money as soon as possible? can you tell people today and promise even if you work a few hours a week, that you will receive those $2, 000 and those funds in the days following April 6?



**Answer**:

Thank you.
Yes, I would like to remind people of what we said this morning.
This morning's announcement has to do with really focusing on continuing to take care of each other.
This message applies to young people, to seniors, to homeless people, or to people who have a home but can't stay there.
As for young people, they are also experiencing some anxiety.
That's why we announced the kids' help phone announcement this morning.
We are here for you.
There is a way to be heard.
If you call over the phone or if you text.
As for seniors, we know they are feeling a great deal of anxiety.
They feel alone.
New horizons for seniors is a program we know very well here in the federal government.
It is an excellent program.
United way is an essential program.
This is money that can be provided quickly through these sources.
These community funds can be used to organize volunteer activities, some delivery services for groceries, for instance, some health check-ins, for instance.
It's important to work on reallytaking care of each other.
To answer your question about people who are homeless, yes, there are people -- we are asking many people to stay home and there are many people who are homeless in the quÉbec city region and elsewhere who feel there is nowhere they can call home.
We have community organizations that can help people find that place to seek protection.
So that amount, the $157.5 million is very important to quÉbec specifically and for those who are experiencing family violence, it's very significant also to remember that there is some people who cannot go home and are not safe at home.
Unfortunately, we've seen a hikein family violence and domestic violence.
It's important to support these people.
Now, to answer your question specifically, we are working very hard in a situation we've never experienced before in thiscountry, to give Canadians the support and also the assurance that we will be there to help them.
Some details have not been ironed out as to the Canada emergency response benefit.
We are working night and day to prepare this information and to deliver these details.
There is also the situation of implementation.
April 6 remains the date for thecanada portal to be up and running, but according to that information that we have, that date is still standing.
We are working hard to make surethat is up and running.
April 6 is when the portal will be running, but therefore then there will be announcements not only to inform Canadians but to reassure them.

**Question**:

Follow up --



**Rosemary**:

We'll say goodbye to our viewers on CBC Manitoba.



This issue of isolation, people are hearing it might lastmonths.
To what extent are you concerned about that social crisis?



**Answer**:

There is a health emergency we're talking about a great deal.
There is an economic emergency as well.
Underlying that, there is a social emergency and that has todo with the confidence people have in their institution and the Canadian people specifically.
What I say to people, have faith.
We are listening to you.
No one will be cast aside.
We are in a crisis situation, but we are working very hard to make sure everyone has the capacity to take care of his or her health and has bread on the table over the coming weeks and months.
This crisis will be ongoing for the next couple of weeks.

The next question is from David youngren from "reuters." your line is open.

**Question**:

First question to Dr. Tam.
is there anything in the last 24hours' data that makes you feel optimistic or concerned about the way things are going?



**Answer**:

I think yesterday I spoke about some sort of very, very early and cautious optimism in British Columbia in terms of their growth in the numbers of cases slowing down a bit.
It's still too early to tell and we are watching that developmentclosely.
Of course a whole number of measures on the public health side were put in place around that sort of may 12 to 13 date and a week after that.
So it takes a bit of time to seethe effect of those measures.
But I have to emphasize that Canada is a big country, so different parts of Canada are experiencing this epidemic in a slightly different timing and their acceleration and deceleration will potentially bedifferent.
So I'm certainly watching very closely what's happening in quÉbec and Ontario in particular, but also Alberta of course.
All of these areas have had reports of community transmission.
I think because of the measures put in, you know, we have to see what will happen next.
But at the same time I have to say with the chief medical officers of health we think what more can we do. You still have to act fast.
You're still waiting for your data, but every day we think what more should we be doing and that is in concert with some observations, of course, as to whether or not Canadians are heeding the advice.
So I think in different jurisdictions they are looking at these measures.
So you've seen some of these announcements by different areas in quÉbec and also in Ontario and others, that they've put in place to try to really double down on that social distancing and reduction in that sort of movement of persons as much as possible.
I still think it's a little too early to tell because we are only at the end of March, but next week will be very, very important for me anyway in terms of looking at those trends.



Thank you, doctor.
David, a follow up?

**Question**:

Yeah, you say it's --



Operator?



Thank you.
The next question is from joellelavance from "la presse."

---

**Question**:

Thank you very much.
Mr. Duclos, can you give us an update regarding e. I. applications.
We heard that 900, 000 Canadians have asked for e. I. what can you tell us about this?



**Answer**:

Thank you.
I do not have the exact figures, but we are above 1 million claims for e. I., employment insurance.
One thing I would add is this is an extraordinary situation in our country.
Canada has never dealt with such high number of employment insurance applications in such Short time frame.
This is why it's critical that the government of Canada's social security system adjust.
That's why we've also put forward this Canadian emergency response benefit to be as swift and nimble as we want to be inclusive, we want to include those who otherwise would not have access to e. I. in fact, it's a lot more generous, also, than what many people would have received otherwise.
In many cases it would be social assistance for some.
So that's why this CERB was created to alleviate this severe pressure that would be felt on the e. I. system and on service Canada specifically.

---

**Question**:

Second question.
Parliamentary budget officer last week was referring to a potential deficit of $112 billion.
Do you have any information as to those figures?



**Answer**:

The second thing we need to recognize is that this is an emergency situation and things are evolving quickly.
That's an estimate.
As the parliamentary budget officer said himself.
That estimate is based on the information that he had at the time.
Just a few days ago, right, but in this environment a few days ago is significant.
As Minister morneau said recently, not only do we have the means to take care of each other, the Canadian government has means to protect and take care of our businesses.
We also have an obligation to doso.
The alternative, if we did not act swiftly, would be far worse.
When our economy recovers and we get this engine up and running again, we'll have to count on our smes, on our businesses and our people to shorten this crisis as much as possible and also to make sure that what follows, that rebuilding, that relaunching of our economy will happen as swiftly, as quickly, and as well as possible.
Thank you, Minister.
[end of translation].



One last question from the room and we'll call it a day.

---

**Question**:

This question is for you, Mr. Duclos.
During world war ii when the government of Canada asked companies to change supply line sand build things for the war, we guaranteed those companies that we would purchase everything they made to make sure they were whole after the war was done.
For small- and medium-sized businesses who are looking to change their business to build things for the government, will you ensure that the canadian government will purchase those things from them?



**Answer**:

Thank you, that is an important question.
The general context as you have alluded to slightly is we are Ina situation of war or similar TA situation of war.
Therefore, the industrial policy and the procurement abilities of the federal government are absolutely essential.
That's why just a week ago we did announce that much of the industrial -- our industrial capacity in Canada, including the procurement ability of the government to channel and to support that industrial capacity is going to be directed towards fighting the COVID-19. Now, that requires ways of doing things with businesses that we haven't seen for certainly quit ea while.
I know that Minister Annam and Minister Bains and many other colleagues are working diligently with those businesses that were mentioned earlier.
I know there will be further announcements on that quite soon.

---

**Question**:

If there are businesses at home thinking that they want to change their supply chains but they haven't talked to the government, should they do that, knowing the government will buy the stuff they are making?



**Answer**:

I think the call for help and the call for collaboration is strong and clear.
So we understand that there is allot of not only ability but willingness on the part of our industrial sectors in Canada to be there to support the fight against the virus.
So I would -- and we would encourage those companies to be in touch with the -- with procurement and public services Canada and with Minister Bains' office around innovation and technology and economic development to make sure that this effort, this significant effort that is already underway, is not only coordinated but supported appropriately by the federal government.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
and that is our daily briefing from federal officials.
This time the president of the treasury board, Mr. Duclos, and other ministers and officials there to bring us up-to-date.
You heard Mr. Duclos saying we are in a similar situation to a war and ensuring that we have the supplies needed.
He was talking about that at theend.
Just to give an update on the numbers of Canadians looking forhelp.
The last number we had for people requesting employment insurance was under one million.
Mr. Duclos didn't have a precisenumber, but he say we are over 1million Canadians looking to thegovernment for help.
Again they say it is a week starting tomorrow, April 6, a week tomorrow that that portal will open up for the emergency care benefits.
You can start applying for that help if you have not registered for e. I., in which case you willautomatically get into that benefit there.



> let's bring in the cbc's David Cochrane in Ottawa.
I may turn to you, David, to talk about some of the information Dr. Tam gave us, particularly around whether we are prepared or whether she has seen anything hopeful or not in the data that we have so far.



**David**:

I thought that question from our colleague at "reuters" was illustrative.
Dr. Tam said she didn't weigh Inonu the data as of yet only to highlight the earlier and encouraging signs out of British Columbia.
But she made the point that this next week is going to be critical.
The data of the next several days is going to tell an important story here in Canada, focusing primarily on two things.
One is the amount of virus and amount of spread that may developed by those 1 million Canadians returning from either their spring break or their usual trip down south as a snowbird, spending the harsh winter months in the warmer southern states of the United States.
and also to get a sense of the impact on the physical distancing and extreme isolation measures that have been taken across the country, where every single provinces and territories is under a public health emergency or a full-blown state of emergency to try to deal withthis.
The numbers are steadily tickingup.
We're going to be over 6, 000 cases by the end of the day today.
I think that is a safe prediction on My part, rosie.
The rate of increase and how that spread is happening over the next five to 10 days, that is going to be very critical because this is the point where we will be able to truly assess the effectiveness of the measures that we have put in place.
So not a very specific answer ofhope of despair today from Dr. Tam, but a very important signalling of what to look for and what to watch for and what to interpret what we see over the coming days.



**Rosemary**:

Keeping an eye specifically on quÉbec, where there are a large number of cases and Ontario and Alberta.
Thank you, David, for all the coverage today.
I appreciate it very much.
I'm sure I'll see you tomorrow.
Cbc's David Cochrane here in Ottawa.
