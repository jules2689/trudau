### Summary:



For a lot of students, the month of may normally marks the start of a summer job.
We'll also be providing specific support for indigenous student and for student researchers and graduate students, we'll invest over $291 million to extend scholarships, fellowships and grants to make sure you can keep working, depending on your funding, it will be extended by either three or four months.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1, 000 to $5, 000 depending on your hours through the new Canada student service grant. We're doubling the student grants that the government gives out for the 2020-21 school year.
For students in Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, we will be providing funding to the provincial and territorial governments so they can increase their financial aid programmes.
At the same time, we'll provide over $75 million to increase supports specifically for first nations, Inuit and m√âtis nations students.



To all the students watching today, let me say this -- as you're building your future, thinking about how to contribute, about starting a family or career, all of a sudden you're faced with a massive crisis.
These measures will help you get through this so you can build that career and the future that you have been looking forward to, that we have been looking forward to for you. Today, on earth day, we're reminded that the way forward includes a healthy environment and a strong, sustainable economy.
