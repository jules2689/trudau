**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

For a lot of students, the month of may normally marks the start of a summer job.
But right now it might be really tough to find something.
You may have been looking for weeks without any success.
So we're going to help.
Our government is creating 76, 000 jobs for young people, in addition to the Canada summer jobs programme.
These placements will be in sectors that need an extra hand right now or that are on the front lines of this pandemic.
We'll also be providing specific support for indigenous student and for student researchers and graduate students, we'll invest over $291 million to extend scholarships, fellowships and grants to make sure you can keep working, depending on your funding, it will be extended by either three or four months.
Of course a peeing job isn't the only valuable way to spend your summer.
Volunteering can be a fantastic way to build skills, make contacts or just give back.
If you're volunteering instead of working, we're going make sure that you have support, too.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1, 000 to $5, 000 depending on your hours through the new Canada student service grant.
Your energy and your skills can do a lot of good right now.




**Interpreter**:

If you are a student, it is tough finding a summer job now because of COVID-19. Our government will be creating 76, 000 additional jobs for young people in those sectors that need help right now or are contributing directly to our responses to the pandemic.
These jobs are in addition to the one under the Canada summer jobs programme.
We'll also be providing targeted help to indigenous students the and with respect to research, we will be investing more than $291 million to extend grants or fellowships by three or four month and, therefore, allow them to continue their work.
At the same time, we are currently introducing the Canadian student service grant.
If you want to volunteer to help fee ting COVID-19 this summer you will be able to receive from $1, 000 to $5 ,000 depending on your hours.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Things may be hard for the next little while, but we're going to support you through it. We're doubling the student grants that the government gives out for the 2020-21 school year.
For students in Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, we will be providing funding to the provincial and territorial governments so they can increase their financial aid programmes.
At the same time, we'll provide over $75 million to increase supports specifically for first nations, Inuit and mÉtis nations students.



**Interpreter**:

Today, I'm also announcing that we'll double the amount of money being provided for 2020-2021 and for students in Quebec, the north west territories and Nunavut, we will be granting that funding to provincial and territorial governments so they can extend their own financial assistance programme.
At the same time, we will be investing more than $75 million to support Inuit first nations and mÉtis students.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

To all the students watching today, let me say this -- as you're building your future, thinking about how to contribute, about starting a family or career, all of a sudden you're faced with a massive crisis.
This uncertainty that you feel can be overwhelming.
Be but in Canada, we look out for each other.
We value hard work, service, education.
These measures will help you get through this so you can build that career and the future that you have been looking forward to, that we have been looking forward to for you.
On the other side of this, when the economy comes roaring back, you will define our path forward a path towards a better, more equal society.
That is what we're dinging to. Today, on earth day, we're reminded that the way forward includes a healthy environment and a strong, sustainable economy.
Although our immediate focus is on the fight against COVID-19, we will always do our part to build a brighter future for tomorrow.




**Interpreter**:

Today, earth day remaoenls us that we must sustain a healthy environment.
Although right now we're concerned about fighting COVID-19, we will always do what needs to be done to build a better future for our generation and future generations.
I know that within the last six weeks our lives have changed one way or the other.
Right now the future may seem even more uncertain, but whoever you might be, we are there for you.
We need for you to do your part as well.
Please continue to stay home, wash your hands and keep a two-metre distance from others.
Thank you very much.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'd like you to comment on the horror stories that we're hearing in many seniors homes.
People who are dying home alone, no food, terrible lack of staff.
Yes, this is a provincial jurisdiction, but given the seriousness of the situation, do you sfwoenld intervene and respond? yes.
We're helping the provinces and will provide the necessary support to them.
We are working with them now to ensure that employees who work and have low incomes will receive supplemental income and we are currently putting regulations in place to ensure that our seniors can be protected.
But we all know that this is an extremely serious situation for our seniors and in seniors homes across the country, we're seeing the effects of COVID-19. People who are working in these homes are always doing an outstanding job.
But now it is an even more difficult job.
Follow-up? do you think that Quebec is control of the situation right now? we're taught about a serious lack of staff.
Why have they not been deployed in regards to a potential military situation.
We have received requests from Quebec and we did send in the army.
We continue to work with Quebec to provide as much help as possible.
But we know that Quebec is working very hard to resolve that situation.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, Teresa wright, the kneadian press.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Could you please explain why will you not make the CERB a universal benefit?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We just moved forward with support today.
The Canada emergency response benefit is there for people who lost a paycheque.
We recognize, because of COVID-19, there are many people out of work who were counting on a paycheque to be able to pay for their groceries, to be antibiotic to pay their rent.
Those people are helped by the CERB.
We are moving to ward with direct help for students.
In many cases, school year term ends now, it's around the end of April and normally they would be looking for summer jobs.
This is something that will not happen the same way or as easily this year.
That is why we're moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit.
But on top of that, we will be helping students across the country by creating new jobs where young people can serve and contribute and get jobs.
If they volunteer, we will be rewarding them for volunteering as well.
We need to create a range of measures to support young people and that is what we've done today to the total of $9 billion.
At the same time, we recognize that there are further gaps we need to continue to work on in terms of covering.
We continue to work with allies and opposition parties and partners across areaings of the country to deliver more help to those who need it.



Follow up question?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

The Canada emergency response benefit is already helping many people who lost a paycheque and we need it to help those people.
But we also recognize that students who are finishing their school year would normally be looking for jobs now and for the summer.
They will have a tough time finding one.
They will be creating jobs in sectors that they can make themselves useful.
At the seam time, we are delivering an emergency student benefit to ensure they have money to pay their rent and their groceries.



**Reporter**:

We heard many Canadians who are falling through the gaps.
You said so yourself.
There is a growing push for universal benefits.
Why is this something that you are not doing at this point? our focus at this point is getting help to people who needed it. There are millions of Canadians who need help.
There are others who do not need help and we feel that targeting the maximum amount of help to the people who needed it quickly was the right way to begin to get through this process.
That is what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit that is delivering that help to over eight million Canadians already.
We need to do more, and that is why we're announcing the Canada students benefit.
But our approach has been to give as much help as possible to the people who need it. That is why we took the approach that we did.



**Interpreter**:

Our approach in this crisis and this situation has always been to provide as much help as possible to those who need it. There are millions of Canadians who need the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy so we moved quickly to deliver those two programmes.
But there are other Canadians who do not need help at this time.
These people continue to work and receive a paycheque.
Therefore, we can give the people to those who need it most instead of universal he. We need to be there for each other and we decided to give precedence to the people who need help.



Next question.



**Operator**:

Thank you.

**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like you to comment on the plans of certain provinces to lift the lockdownment they're saying that slowly they have to re-open their economy and this is urgent.
Are you comfortable with the beginnings of this relaxation of rules and will you be giving some flexibility to the provinces in terms of the border with the United States? can you clarify what you meant? for example, could the provinces re-open their border with the United States, before a federal order in council ends at the end of April or is your flexibility meaning to only do that later on? first of all, we all recognize that the pandemic is rolling out defrnlly in different provinces and regions.
Therefore, the provinces and territories will be making their own decisions as to the next steps when I comes to re-opening the economy.
But we are working with the provinces in close coordination to ensure that our principles and our approach are similar right across the country.
So that people will understand what's happening in their area and across the country.
With respect to the United States border, the measures that are now in place until may 21 will remain in place across the country and in terms of what happens after may 21, we'll have more discussions with the United States and probably across provinces on that.
But this is a cross-Canada measure.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that defrnl provinces will make different decisions about how and where to restart and open their economies.
We will work to co-ordinate so that we're basing ourselves on sheared values, principles and scientific approaches across the country.
Yes, provinces will take their decisions that we will work to co-ordinate in a cohesive story for all Canadians.
In regards to re-opening the border with the United States, that is a federal and national decision that we will kaord naet.
But the national measures will apply across the Canada-United States border regardless of provinces or jurisdictions.







**Interpreter**:

Follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Coming back to the situation in Quebec, more than 50% of the deaths in Canada are in Quebec facilities.
As a quebecer, what does it mean to see this and what can the federal government do other than beefing up people's wages and helping people with rent? what can you do on the ground? to try and flatten that curb and lessen the number of deaths that are occurring? we represent provincial jurisdiction and I believe that Quebec is doing a good job in managing those issues.
But obviously we are there as a federal government to provide aid when it's needed and when Quebec asks us for that aid.
We sent in the c. a.f. In Quebec.
This was a request from Quebec.
We provided direct support through other measures that will help.
For example, regulations with represent to seniors homes that are applied across the country and that are in full alignment with Quebec's decisions.
We are there to be a partner and support Quebec and respond to any requests for P.P.E., for example.
Which Quebec has asked for.
The federal government as its role to play.
But we will always respect provincial jurisdiction and support them in responding.



**Operator**:

Thank you.

Next question, line open.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, good morning.
[inaudible] last week decided to [inaudible] to qualify for $40, 000 loan.
It is a welcomed step.
But still there are many small businesses leek small restaurants, convenience stores, Dr. cleaning shops who won't be ever to get this benefit because of many reasons.
These are businesses already struggling and now we have a report that in Toronto [inaudible] won't re-open after three months.
What [inaudible] is being done to help these businesses?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that businesses, particularly small businesses, are facing an extremely difficult teem through COVID-19. and we need to support these small businesses, not just because they are main drao*efers of our economy and of our employment right across the country, but because we need them to be in good shape when this COVID-19 crisis is through so they can come back.
That is why our crisis has been on those who lose a paycheque and their jobs with the Canada workers subsidy and the Canada emergency response benefit.
We also recognize that small businesses, including the smallest businesses need help with access to credit which is why we put in place a 2k4r0r, 000 loan with a $10, 000 nonrepayable element that is going to be helping small businesses significantly.
As you said, we heard from some very small businesses that weren't qualifying at the threshold with $50, 000, which is why we dropped it down to $20 240u thousand, which is the equivalent of one full-time worker at minimum wage for the year.
We recognize that there are other small businesses that are not getting the support they need because of particularities in their circumstance and we're continuing to work with finance and with business associations to make sure that we're giving these businesses the support they need, not just to get through this difficult time but make sure they come back strong at the end of it.



and a follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, the [inaudible] is doing its best to bring Canadians back home.
But there are 50, 000 Canadians stuck in India right now.
Many of them are children.
Families are worried about their well-being.
They're frustrated that the canadian high commission office has not been able to provide them timely help.
Even our high commissioner has apologized to them for this situation.
is the Prime Minister aware of the situation and any immediate help for them?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are very aware of the challenge of cadians wanting to return to Canada at a time when international flights are extremely limited.
We continue to work with governments around the world, including the indian government.
We have welcomed over the past month about 20, 000 Canadians home from repatriation flights.
It is important to be able to bring home Canadians.
There are particularly high demands in some parts of world, including india, that we're working very, very hard, day and night to try to resolve.
There's been many flights back from india, but there is a need for more.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Obviously roxham road remains closed but people coming in to official border points will be able to apply for refugee status and be sent to a hotel.
What exactly is the safe third party agreement Stael in place? we need some clarification on this.
Based on what I know, the safe third country agreement still in place, if there are new directives, we will be following up to give you that information.
But have things changed since last night? not as far as I know.
But I know that Muenster Blair will be able to provide more information as to whether or not there are changes.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Far I'm e I've been apprised there haven't been any changes at the border.
But if there have been, I'm sure Minister Blair would be able to fill you in on those.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

On the question of the guaranteed minimum income, do you not think it would have been simpler to put in place a more universal programme, more open administratively speaking? in other words, create a single benefit rather why not do that? were you afraid of significant abuse? there are some people who think it would have been a simpler solution but maybe not simpler at all in terms of its add mention.
-- administration.
It's not as simple as send ago cheque to every single Canadian, whatever their age or wherever they live.
It is always bit more complicated than that.
and second, and this is the major reason, we decided to help first and foremost, and as much as possible, the people who really need help.
So all of these measures we introduced recognize that people have lost jobs and Lister that income because of COVID-19. It is not their fault and they need income in order to pay for their groceries and support their family and pay their rent.
That is why we chose to move in a targeted fashion very quickly to deliver assistance to these people who need help and that is exactly what we did.
We see that more than eight million Canadians are receiving the Canada emergency response benefit and just announced support for students as well.
and there will be future announcements to help others who need help.



**Reporter**:

Yesterday you cede you would proceed with gun control legislation at the appropriate time.
We've seen other countries, Australia and new Zealand, act very quickly after mass shootings.
Why do you think this isn't the appropriate time? and do you not believe the department can't deal with two pressing issues at the same time?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are certainly looking at introducing the gun control measures that were ready to go but were suspended because of COVID-19. The rules the terms of parliament in a reduced state specifically sate that we need to only introduce measures related to COVID-19 but we will be seeing with other parties if there is an appetite to move more quickly in place given the tragedy we just had.



**Interpreter**:

We were almost in that position to introduce that bill before parliament was suspended.
The conditions of parliament meeting in restricted numbers means that the legislation now that we introduce must be related to COVID-19. But we are prepared to speak to the other part is to see if they're prepared to move more quickly on strengthening gun control.



**Reporter**:

Are comparatively modest compared to other countries, particularly Australia after the port Arthur massacre in 1996.
Are you willing now to revisit the measures before parliament and strengthen them, particularly with regard to ownership of restricted weapons like handguns and certain semi-automatic rifles?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We made strong commitment in the last election campaign on strengthening gun control.
There was



a significant debate in this country that continues between parties in favour of strengthening gun control and other parties that want to weaken gun control.
There continues to be a need for debate but we are resolute that we need to move forward on strengthening gun control legislation in small, common sense ways.
They have no place in our communities, in our country, and that is why we'll be moving forward with legislation to ban them.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Tom Perry with CBC.
You said in your announcement you're making 76, 000 jobs for young people and they will be in sectors that need an extra hand right now and are on the front lines of the pandemic.
We heard about contact tracing, needing people there.
Where will they be working?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we're looking at contact tracing and sectors that need extra support, perhaps agriculture and others.
We will have more to say in the coming days as we develop this.
But we know young people want and need good summer jobs and we're going to make sure that we can get them.



**Reporter**:

You talked earlier about seniors homes and the tragedy unfolding there.
The government has announced support for essential workers there.
Has there been much buy-in? is that helping anyone yet? and do you see a greater role for the federal government in ensuring a standard of care.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We see a couple of provinces, like British Columbia and Quebec, move forward on support for essential workers who are low paid but in important areas like if long-term care facilities.
That is why we are talking with provinces about expanding and supporting them in those programmes.
There have been discussions ongoing with the provinces, recognizing as was pointed out that it is very much a provincial jurisdiction but recognize this is a problem we want help with.
The larger question we're all facing is an understanding that in many parts of this country and many places across this country, the people who care for our most vulnerable are they themselves are the most vulnerable and we need to have a reflection as we get through this crisis and certainly after it on how we ensure that the people taking care of the most vulnerable are not themselves vulnerable.




**Interpreter**:

I think it is clear now that we're working with the provinces to help address all sorts of situations en colluding in seniors homes but we will have to reflect as a country and as a society on how we can ensure that the most vulnerable people are not being helped by people who are also extremely vulnerable.
We need to ensure that people doing that important work of caring for elderly and vulnerable Canadians are not themselves extremely vulnerable economically.



**Reporter**:

Just to follow-up on seniors.
There's been a number of announcements today for students, previously for businesses, etc.
I wofnler specifically in terms of seniors and recently retired people who have lost their savings or substantial amount of savings due to COVID-19. Will there be help for them?



Prime Minister Trudeau's yes, there will be help for seniors.
People who lost their incomes and lost their jobs, that is what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.
Now, as the school year comes to an end in April for university students, we're moving forward with support for university students baz they are going to need help in finding a job, in getting income replacement at a time when they would be counting on money to help them pay rent and pay groceries.
At the same time, even though many seniors continue to have the same fixed income they had from the government from pensions, there are concerns both about their long-term savings, which is why we made change on the rrif withdrawals and recognize that the cost of living has gone up for seniors as they're facing challenges because COVID-19 targets seniors to a greater degree.
So, we're working right now on measures for seniors.
I want to thank the other parties that made excellent suggestions and we'll have more to announce in the coming days.




**Interpreter**:

We decided to give a priority to people who had lost their pay cheques because of COVID-19. With the wage subsidy and the response benefit, we are helping those people two really needed help right away, as soon as the COVID-19 situation began.
and today, because we are coming to the end of the school year for students in the post-secondary education centre, we realise we had to give them help because they will need to find jobs in May or jobs for the summer, so we're introducing the Canada emergency student benefit.
We will also be looking at seniors situations.
We have already brought in some mercks to help them, be we will be doing more and we will have more to say about that in the coming days.



**Reporter**:

Finally, in terms of those awful events that happened over the weekend in Nova Scotia, I'm wondering if your government is looking at introducing federal guidelines or have a deal with an active shooter?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there are many families that are grieving incredible losses right now who are asking how things could have been difference and how they would have been warned earlier.
Those are extremely important questions that I know will be addressed through the investigations and the conclusions.
We need to protect citizens in every circumstance.
and those are something that we'll be talk about in the coming days and weeks.
Merci.







**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada, today wrapping up his COVID-19 briefing to the nation.
The announcement today, all about students and making sure that they can goat access to money and jobs.
As we know, this has been an issue for many students.
and I'll go into details with My colleagues after 12:00. But I want to get a reaction.
Keenan black more is a first-year student at mcgill yaoufrments he was listening closely to what the Prime Minister had to say.
Keegan, did it sound like anything there will be able to help you immediately?



Yes.
Truthfully, I think this is a very encouraging figure.
$9 billion total.
I do like particularly the fact that you can have a tandem of supports, the student benefit and then seek outside resources or volunteer experience.
I think that is very encouraging.



**Marcy**:

--



**Rosemary**:

You are a first-year law student.
Would you have been looking at work in your field or taken any job sort of thing?



Originally, I had been working in a legal field.
I have some in policy analysis so that might have been a field I was looking at. After the COVID-19 experience, I did start to fall back on My undergrad degree, but I was unable to find any employment.



**Rosemary**:

and what do you use your summer job money for?



For myself, I'm one of students, and I'm sure there are many out there, who does require the funding in other words to pay for his education.
I funded My ungrad and I'm doing the same for My law degree.
Having employment in the summer is an essential aspect of My summer experience.



**Rosemary**:

There is the $1250 per month from may to August.
and there is also, as you said, the opportunity to try and get a job.
As one of these front line essential kind of jobs in those fields.
is that something that you perhaps would look at now?



Absolutely.
Any way to make My life easier in terms of My financial base, I will be looking at volunteering and I do think that having the grant in place for next summer -- sorry, next school year also will allow me to have some more financial freedom in the times.



**Rosemary**:

I know there was a lot of concerns from students on tweter.
People were at me every day saying we don't qualify for the CERB because we didn't make $5, 000 or didn't have a job that we lost due to COVID-19. So it was one or the other.
What would have happened if there was no package, nothing offered to you at all?



Well t prate marry thing I've been doing is applying for scholarships through mcgill.
For the most part, it would have been taking on some sort of loan or maybe a line of credit in other words to be able to continue My education which brings with it some interest and other consequences.
So it could have been quite tough.



**Rosemary**:

I would imagine.
and you can't always turn to your parents for help, either.
That wasn't an option for you either.



No, I was not.



**Rosemary**:

No. So, how do you feel knowing that this is going to be, I think, up and running by may.
is that good enough? how are you feeling about it?



I am quite encouraged, as I said.
There may gaps for students in the most expensive provinces.
Ontario, British Columbia.
I do think, as I said, the fact that you can have both the emergency fund and then also some funding through volunteering will try to -- will hopefully met gait -- mitigate some of these gaps.
It is an encouraging first step, but there still might be some gaps.



**Rosemary**:

Neigh you see yourself doing in temples of volunteer work?



Honestly, farming sounds quite interesting.
[laughter]I do have a background in athletics.
So, I'm not adverse to rolling up the sleeves and getting out there and doing whatever I can do to support fellow canadian and also myself.
Farming, contact tracing.
Any way that I can help with the current efforts, I will be exploring.



**Rosemary**:

Well, you are the perfect example of what they want, keegan.
I hope that all comes through for you.
Thank you for your perspective right away and wishing you all the best now that you know you have a little more security to count on in the months ahead.



Thank you very much.
It was My pleasure.



**Rosemary**:

Keenan black more of mcgill university.
Let me summarize what the Prime Minister had to say as we switch over to CBC news network.
As you heard from keegan, it is a $9 billion package that the government announced today, targeting students.
So $1250 per month from may to August will now be available for students and there are certain criteria, but it is open ended.
That is essentially the student version of the CERB can we now know at least six million, seven million Canadians have applied for.
The government will also create 76, 000 jobs for students and will target essential jobs that are needed right now to deal with the pandemic including as --, as you just heard there from keegan, getting students to work in the farming industry.
The government will also extend scholarships and grants by three to four months.
They will also create a grant called the Canadian student services grant.
So if you go to volunteer at one of the places that need help right now, you will be paid anywhere from $1, 000 to $5, 000.
Finally for low-income students getting grands, those grants will be doubled from $3, 000 to $6, 000 going to ward.
Meaning depending on what province you're in, you might end up having your tuition near free for the year ahead.
Ok. That is our coverage here on cbc television.
We'll get into requests and more details at the top of hour on cbc news network.
I'm marry barton.
Thank you for watching.
[please stand by [[please stand by]



**Rosemary**:

We are now hearing that a warning did go out to dual citizens in the province.
The RCMP sent out a tweet onsaturday night and early sundaymorning.
Let's go now to Portapique, where the violence began and where Brett Ruskin is today and he has new details for us. Brett.



**Reporter**:

Well, some new details according to court records about this suspect.
We now know CBC news learned that he was convicted of an assault back in 2001.
He was conditionally discharged and go into anger managementcounseling.
This is a bit more information about this suspect, but in terms of the information itself, inportapique, you can see a couple of police vehicles and there have been police vehicles coming in and out all day long and this is one of 16 different sites across the province.
Investigators are still combing through the scene and they involve buildings that have been completely destroyed by fire andthey're combing through them carefully and there was an excavator on site yesterday slowly taking apart that rubble and looking for any additional casualties in mass murder and sowe're taking a look at that and waiting for the update fromrcmp.
We're told there may be a newsrelease, possibly a newsconference, but at least some text information at the very least coming out today.



Brett Ruskin continuing to track that important story and we will check in with you as you get more news, appreciateimprovement.
As we stand by for the cabinet ministers and public healthofficial's briefing here inottawa, let me bring in the hosthost, Massey kapelos and the government focused on students who are coming to the end of their school year with no prospect of work or very little prospect of work, $9 billion in terms of the total package andvassy, what stood out for you?



**Vassy**:

Quickly what you were talking about with Brett and whether or not an alert should have been issued, the Prime Minister did touch on that at the end of his press conference and recognised there are questions around that, particularly to the timing that and would it have made adifference.
He said the investigation would take place and did address that and significant that the Prime Minister noted those questions do exist right now.
On students, a very big announcement for them today.
Obviously the impact of it still has yet to be judged and you interviewed who seemed to thin kit would help him.
The marquis part is another one of those emergency benefits.
It seems like, this one, thecanada emergency studentsbenefit, $1250 a month for students who don't qualify for the CERB.
The big part that makes it hard for them to qualify is they had to have made at least $5, 000 in the last 12 months.
This is for them, 1250 a month and up to 750 a month for eligible students with dependents or disability.
So a bit more from them.
You went over the other stuff, doubling of grants, as well as more job placement, the government says through thecanada summer's job programmeand they set it up to 70, 000 and now saying 76, 000 and also agrant, as well, for students who choose to volunteer for all of this and more opportunity for them to access money that theywouldn't have been able to access prior to this.
I think that, again, we'll have to see how much it helps.
It is 1250, not 2, 000 but a lot more than they'll be able to access yesterday.
The other thing that I wanted to highlight is gun legislation.
and the change in posture from the Prime Minister today who yesterday acknowledged that was something they were ready tointroduce, more gun controllegislation.
They have campaigned extalkedabout it last year and he says that he's willing talk to opposition parties about kind of changing the rules of parliament which is structured to only deal with COVID-19-relatedlegislation and see if they wereopen to introducing that priorto, in this sort of setting.
I don't know what stage thosediscussions are at. The conservatives would notsupport that legislation and idon't know what form it wouldtake, so it depends whether theopposition parties will, as well.
That would be an interestingmovement, as well.



**Rosemary**:

That definitely was new.
Hard to see how they would reach some sort of compromise in reduced parliament to pass legislation that would be highly controversial for some parts of the country, anyway, who would take issue with a ban on some assault rifles that have been approved or in the hands of somecanadians.
I would be very curious to see how that would happen.
That's the kind of example you would need full representation of the country to best reflect how Canadians feel about gunlaws.
So anyway, but you're right.



**Vassy**:

We don't know many of the details what happened in nova Scotia.
We don't know about the firearms that were used, so that the length between that legislation and the crime that took place, obviously there could be one, but we don't know for certain.



**Rosemary**:

David, I'll let you go where you want but one of the interesting things about the announcement today was the ability or the intent to try to help students who won't getjobs, but to push those students to the places that the economy and society needs the help, whether it be volunteering, agriculture, and I think that'san interesting way to solve couple of problems at once.



**David**:

Two things students are dealing with, lost income and lost opportunity, right.
The summer jobs and the jobs you work part-time in highereducationer certainly help youto build pathways to careerspost-graduation.
You can do that viewvolunteering and getting jobssemi related to your field.
You have a CERB light, up to1750 a month if you'redis-disabilitied.
and then student age changes, they make it easier for peopleto qualify for student loanshelping people pay and there'sthe student employment aspect ofthis.
There was the changes made to the Canada students job'sprogramme rolled out earlier andnow 76 jobs on top of it, thenews release from the governmentsays, this suite of programmeswill create up to 116, 000 jobplacement and other trainingopportunities to help studentsfind employment and developvaluable skills.



**Rosemary**:

So it's on top of the thing from last week?



**David**:

Absolutely.
There's an additional 75, 000jobs on top of the canadastudents loan programme and add sup to 116, 000.
I won't through the math becausei'll get something wrong.
So this tries to cover up some of the system gaps.
The problem, the criticism with the way the government is doing this is there is time gaps.
We heard help is coming for seniors and that's coming soon and so the new democrats, inparticular, saying why didn'tyou just make this universal? it's a question they deal wit hall of the time.
If they had done that, the money would be rolling to all of these people by now through the cerbprogramme but they tried to make it targeted and specific rather than totally universal and giving a pile of money to group of people who completelydon't need it. What they think is an effective way with students is you have combination of methods.
If you finished your program meat the end of 2019, you qualify for the 1, 250 bucks from may to august and you can work and still get that benefit.
My understanding, on seeking clarification from the Prime Minister's office, you can also volunteer on top of that.



**Rosemary**:

Yes.



**David**:

and get extra money up to $5, 000 as compensation for your volunteer time and you can cobble together a decent living which gives you some experience and volunteer service in a time of crisis and a pandemic for the average students.
There will be students with, like, children and disabilities that will require extra help and we need to see the interaction of all of these programmes and the grants and how it comestogether.
It's the reaction on social media from student leaders at different universities and they see this as a big help.
Though, like, everybody in thispandemic, Rosie, no oneprogramme will solve everything.
People are still losing.



**Rosemary**:

To the people ontwitter, as well, saying, well, this is helping me but I still have student loans.
a reminder those loans have beensuspended, at least the federal portion of those loans untilseptember.
and so, it might be enough for many people, but I take yourpoint, with these policy moves, generally there are gaps and as the gaps get exposed, the government does try to solve forthose, as well, because the idea is to make this as broad aspossible.
Although to david's point, if you wanted to do that, the universal income benefit as then.
D.p. Has been suggesting wouldhave done just that but wouldhave captured people making toomuch money and not in need ofit.
Here is Chrystia Freeland, thedeputy Prime Minister withcabinet ministers and let'sbring that to you live.

Hello, everyone.
As usual with the latest number son COVID-19 in Canada, there are now 28, 422 confirmed cases, including 1, 834 deaths.
We are tested over 576, 000people to date with about 6.5%testing positive.
As we continue to make progress in slowing the spread ofcovid-19, we are seeing some bumps in the road that reminds us we can't let down our guard.
We have to act quickly weak points before the virus jumps ahead of us again.
The first hard lesson we learned was seeing how one or two cases in the long-term care settingcould quickly accelerate intolarger outbreaks withdevastating consequences butthis was the start of what'sgrown into a driving fortunebehind the epidemiology incanada's hard-hit provinces.
The risk factors in these typesof settings aren't new.
The fact that the risks aspandemics in spaces with largepopulations that share commonareas and can't maintain optimalphysical distancing are at riskof outbreaks.
If we are to control thecovid-19 epidemic, we mustcontain the spread and stamp outthe burning embers that can leadto new chains of transmission.
To prevent similar outbreaks inshelters and other crowdedliving conditions, we've got tobuild up protections and addressvulnerabilities.

and we are to control thecovid-19 epidemic, we mustcontain spread and stamp out theburning embers that can lead tonew chains of transmission.

To switch gears, I would like torecognise national volunteerweek and express My thanks to the countless Canadians who aregiving up their time to helpduring these difficult times.
Whether you are reaching out bygetting groceries or medicinesfor elders, finding new ways tokeep vulnerable populationsinvolved in programming orproviding care packages andsupport to essential workers onthe road and on the front lines, your support and kindnessmatter, providing much-neededcare to sustain our spirits andshared humanity.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam, and now we will hear from the minister of employment and inclusion, Carla quatro.
(speaking french).



Young Canadians face a series of challenges through this difficult time, whether it be interrupted studies, reduced work opportunities or disruptions to summer internshipplans.
With the suite of measures we are announcing today, we are taking action.
Canada's post-secondary studentsare worried how they will be able to afford tuition and rentif they can't find summer work.
We're introducing a four-monthcanada emergency studentsbenefit.
Students will be able to receive$1, 250, 000 per month between mayand August.
Student ises with permanentdisabilities and dependentscould receive an additional $500a month.
We are here to support you.
This is designed to reach themajority of post-secondarystudents.
In addition, we will fundeligibility for the canadastudent loan's programme forseptember and we will double thevalue of student grants andcrease the cap on studentloans from $210 to $350 per weekof study.
I know that many young canadiansare anxious about the jobperspectives for this summer andthey are looking for jobs instable sectors.
We announced temporary changesto the Canada summer job'sprogramme, and that's just thestart.
There will be trainingopportunities to help studentsfind employment and developvaluable skills this summer andover the coming months and we will create morepaid-workplacements acrosscritical factors like agri-foodand ecommerce.
We will create placements foryoung Canadians in criticalsectors such as canadianservices and investing inbringing important wrap-aroundservices online for the supportof student learning programmes, like mentoring and tutoring toyoung people to make sure theyare not further marginalized bycovid-19. We hope that these measures andothers made as part ofcovid-19's response plan willhelp young people whether theeconomic impacts of thispandemic while ensuring healthand safety.
Thank you.



Thank you, C.R.A. and now we will hear from the associate minister of finance.
(speaking french).



Thank you.
As Canadians are fightingcovid-19, we recognise that many young Canadians are facing an unprecedented challenge.
Students in youth is simple, we have your back.
In addition to the measures announced by My colleagues, we'll provide 291, 000.6 million to support up to 40, 000 student researchers and post doctoral fellows through the councils and this funding would support single semester extension for eligible students who intend to continue their studies but whose research scholarships or fellowships are set to end between March and August of 20. 2020.
On top of the measures announced by My colleagues, there will be$291, 000 in order to support40, 000 students researchers through different federalorganizations.
This funding will allow us to prolong by one semester for students who would like to continue their studies but for whom fellowships -- we know this has impacted students and indigenous youths in a uniqueway.
That's why today's announcement includes 75.2 million in additional distinctions based support to first nations, metisand Inuit first post-secondarystudents.
We know that this pandemic has adifferent impact on indigenousstudents and young people andthat is why $75.2 million willbe offered for additionalsupport based on the differencesfaced by first nation'sindigenous and inuit students.
These new support measures willhelp young Canadians to getthrough this crisis.
This will allow Canada to comeout of this stronger than ever.
Thank you.



Thank you, Mona.
and now we'll hear from the minister of diversity and inclusion and youth also by video youth.
and could we have a bigger image of bartish, please, and be sure she is not on mute.



I think I'm here.



We can hear, but can we try to make the image bigger? start again.
It's perfect.
Here we go.



Good afternoon.
We know that COVID-19 does not discriminate and it has impacted every segment of our society andcanada's youth are no exception.
My colleagues and I, My riding of Waterloo home is home to secondary institutions.
(speaking french).



Young people have concerns which include financialstability, jobs and housing.
Enhancements to programmes and this programme is designed to connect young people aged 15 to30 with opportunities to serve.
We're increasing the number of available micro grants from 1800to 15, 000.
These grants enable young people to design and put into action projects that will make appositive difference in their communities because people who live and work in the communities know them best.
For example, Omar of Quebec was granted $1500 to provide meals to residents severely impacted by the coronavirus.
In the coming weeks, we will launch a new student grant.
Students who get involved to help with the COVID-19 crisis, will be provided with a post secondary cost this fall.
We know that young people have different needs which is why the options have the supports they need to both help the communities and gain skills andexperience.
Thank you.



Thank you, bardish.
