**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

For a lot of students, the month of may normally marks the start of a summer job.
But right now it might be really tough to find something.
You may have been looking for weeks without any success.
So we're going to help.
Our government is creating 76, 000 jobs for young people, in addition to the Canada summer jobs programme.
These placements will be in sectors that need an extra hand right now or that are on the front lines of this pandemic.
We'll also be providing specific support for indigenous student and for student researchers and graduate students, we'll invest over $291 million to extend scholarships, fellowships and grants to make sure you can keep working, depending on your funding, it will be extended by either three or four months.
Of course a peeing job isn't the only valuable way to spend your summer.
Volunteering can be a fantastic way to build skills, make contacts or just give back.
If you're volunteering instead of working, we're going make sure that you have support, too.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1, 000 to $5, 000 depending on your hours through the new Canada student service grant.
Your energy and your skills can do a lot of good right now.




**Interpreter**:

If you are a student, it is tough finding a summer job now because of COVID-19. Our government will be creating 76, 000 additional jobs for young people in those sectors that need help right now or are contributing directly to our responses to the pandemic.
These jobs are in addition to the one under the Canada summer jobs programme.
We'll also be providing targeted help to indigenous students the and with respect to research, we will be investing more than $291 million to extend grants or fellowships by three or four month and, therefore, allow them to continue their work.
At the same time, we are currently introducing the Canadian student service grant.

**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Things may be hard for the next little while, but we're going to support you through it. We're doubling the student grants that the government gives out for the 2020-21 school year.
For students in Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, we will be providing funding to the provincial and territorial governments so they can increase their financial aid programmes.
At the same time, we'll provide over $75 million to increase supports specifically for first nations, Inuit and mÉtis nations students.



**Interpreter**:

Today, I'm also announcing that we'll double the amount of money being provided for 2020-2021 and for students in Quebec, the north west territories and Nunavut, we will be granting that funding to provincial and territorial governments so they can extend their own financial assistance programme.
At the same time, we will be investing more than $75 million to support Inuit first nations and mÉtis students.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

To all the students watching today, let me say this -- as you're building your future, thinking about how to contribute, about starting a family or career, all of a sudden you're faced with a massive crisis.
This uncertainty that you feel can be overwhelming.
Be but in Canada, we look out for each other.
We value hard work, service, education.
These measures will help you get through this so you can build that career and the future that you have been looking forward to, that we have been looking forward to for you.
On the other side of this, when the economy comes roaring back, you will define our path forward a path towards a better, more equal society.
That is what we're dinging to. Today, on earth day, we're reminded that the way forward includes a healthy environment and a strong, sustainable economy.
Although our immediate focus is on the fight against COVID-19, we will always do our part to build a brighter future for tomorrow.




**Interpreter**:

Today, earth day remaoenls us that we must sustain a healthy environment.
Although right now we're concerned about fighting COVID-19, we will always do what needs to be done to build a better future for our generation and future generations.
I know that within the last six weeks our lives have changed one way or the other.
Right now the future may seem even more uncertain, but whoever you might be, we are there for you.
We need for you to do your part as well.
Please continue to stay home, wash your hands and keep a two-metre distance from others.
Thank you very much.
