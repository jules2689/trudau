# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada, today wrapping up his COVID-19 briefing to the nation.
The announcement today, all about students and making sure that they can goat access to money and jobs.
As we know, this has been an issue for many students.
and I'll go into details with My colleagues after 12:00. But I want to get a reaction.
Keenan black more is a first-year student at mcgill yaoufrments he was listening closely to what the Prime Minister had to say.
Keegan, did it sound like anything there will be able to help you immediately?



Yes.
Truthfully, I think this is a very encouraging figure.
$9 billion total.
I do like particularly the fact that you can have a tandem of supports, the student benefit and then seek outside resources or volunteer experience.
I think that is very encouraging.



**Marcy**:

--



**Rosemary**:

You are a first-year law student.
Would you have been looking at work in your field or taken any job sort of thing?



Originally, I had been working in a legal field.
I have some in policy analysis so that might have been a field I was looking at. After the COVID-19 experience, I did start to fall back on My undergrad degree, but I was unable to find any employment.



**Rosemary**:

and what do you use your summer job money for?



For myself, I'm one of students, and I'm sure there are many out there, who does require the funding in other words to pay for his education.
I funded My ungrad and I'm doing the same for My law degree.
Having employment in the summer is an essential aspect of My summer experience.



**Rosemary**:

There is the $1250 per month from may to August.
and there is also, as you said, the opportunity to try and get a job.
As one of these front line essential kind of jobs in those fields.
is that something that you perhaps would look at now?



Absolutely.
Any way to make My life easier in terms of My financial base, I will be looking at volunteering and I do think that having the grant in place for next summer -- sorry, next school year also will allow me to have some more financial freedom in the times.



**Rosemary**:

I know there was a lot of concerns from students on tweter.
People were at me every day saying we don't qualify for the CERB because we didn't make $5, 000 or didn't have a job that we lost due to COVID-19. So it was one or the other.
What would have happened if there was no package, nothing offered to you at all?



Well t prate marry thing I've been doing is applying for scholarships through mcgill.
For the most part, it would have been taking on some sort of loan or maybe a line of credit in other words to be able to continue My education which brings with it some interest and other consequences.
So it could have been quite tough.



**Rosemary**:

I would imagine.
and you can't always turn to your parents for help, either.
That wasn't an option for you either.



No, I was not.



**Rosemary**:

No. So, how do you feel knowing that this is going to be, I think, up and running by may.
is that good enough? how are you feeling about it?



I AM quite encouraged, as I said.
There may gaps for students in the most expensive provinces.
Ontario, British Columbia.
I do think, as I said, the fact that you can have both the emergency fund and then also some funding through volunteering will try to -- will hopefully met gait -- mitigate some of these gaps.
It is an encouraging first step, but there still might be some gaps.



**Rosemary**:

Neigh you see yourself doing in temples of volunteer work?



Honestly, farming sounds quite interesting.
[laughter]I do have a background in athletics.
So, I'm not adverse to rolling up the sleeves and getting out there and doing whatever I can do to support fellow canadian and also myself.
Farming, contact tracing.
Any way that I can help with the current efforts, I will be exploring.



**Rosemary**:

Well, you are the perfect example of what they want, keegan.
I hope that all comes through for you.
Thank you for your perspective right away and wishing you all the best now that you know you have a little more security to count on in the months ahead.



Thank you very much.
It was My pleasure.



**Rosemary**:

Keenan black more of mcgill university.
Let me summarize what the Prime Minister had to say as we switch over to CBC news network.
As you heard from keegan, it is a $9 billion package that the government announced today, targeting students.
So $1250 per month from may to August will now be available for students and there are certain criteria, but it is open ended.
That is essentially the student version of the CERB can we now know at least six million, seven million Canadians have applied for.
The government will also create 76, 000 jobs for students and will target essential jobs that are needed right now to deal with the pandemic including as --, as you just heard there from keegan, getting students to work in the farming industry.
The government will also extend scholarships and grants by three to four months.
They will also create a grant called the Canadian student services grant.
So if you go to volunteer at one of the places that need help right now, you will be paid anywhere from $1, 000 to $5, 000.
Finally for low-income students getting grands, those grants will be doubled from $3, 000 to $6, 000 going to ward.
Meaning depending on what province you're in, you might end up having your tuition near free for the year ahead.
Ok. That is our coverage here on cbc television.
We'll get into requests and more details at the top of hour on cbc news network.
I'm marry barton.
Thank you for watching.
[please stand by [[please stand by]



**Rosemary**:

We are now hearing that a warning did go out to dual citizens in the province.
The RCMP sent out a tweet onsaturday night and early sundaymorning.
Let's go now to Portapique, where the violence began and where Brett Ruskin is today and he has new details for us. Brett.



**Reporter**:

Well, some new details according to court records about this suspect.
We now know CBC news learned that he was convicted of an assault back in 2001.
He was conditionally discharged and go into anger managementcounseling.
This is a bit more information about this suspect, but in terms of the information itself, inportapique, you can see a couple of police vehicles and there have been police vehicles coming in and out all day long and this is one of 16 different sites across the province.
Investigators are still combing through the scene and they involve buildings that have been completely destroyed by fire andthey're combing through them carefully and there was an excavator on site yesterday slowly taking apart that rubble and looking for any additional casualties in mass murder and sowe're taking a look at that and waiting for the update fromrcmp.
We're told there may be a newsrelease, possibly a newsconference, but at least some text information at the very least coming out today.



Brett Ruskin continuing to track that important story and we will check in with you as you get more news, appreciateimprovement.
As we stand by for the cabinet ministers and public healthofficial's briefing here inottawa, let me bring in the hosthost, Massey kapelos and the government focused on students who are coming to the end of their school year with no prospect of work or very little prospect of work, $9 billion in terms of the total package andvassy, what stood out for you?



**Vassy**:

Quickly what you were talking about with Brett and whether or not an alert should have been issued, the Prime Minister did touch on that at the end of his press conference and recognised there are questions around that, particularly to the timing that and would it have made adifference.
He said the investigation would take place and did address that and significant that the Prime Minister noted those questions do exist right now.
On students, a very big announcement for them today.
Obviously the impact of it still has yet to be judged and you interviewed who seemed to thin kit would help him.
The marquis part is another one of those emergency benefits.
It seems like, this one, thecanada emergency studentsbenefit, $1250 a month for students who don't qualify for the CERB.
The big part that makes it hard for them to qualify is they had to have made at least $5, 000 in the last 12 months.
This is for them, 1250 a month and up to 750 a month for eligible students with dependents or disability.
So a bit more from them.
You went over the other stuff, doubling of grants, as well as more job placement, the government says through thecanada summer's job programmeand they set it up to 70, 000 and now saying 76, 000 and also agrant, as well, for students who choose to volunteer for all of this and more opportunity for them to access money that theywouldn't have been able to access prior to this.
I think that, again, we'll have to see how much it helps.
It is 1250, not 2, 000 but a lot more than they'll be able to access yesterday.
The other thing that I wanted to highlight is gun legislation.
and the change in posture from the Prime Minister today who yesterday acknowledged that was something they were ready tointroduce, more gun controllegislation.
They have campaigned extalkedabout it last year and he says that he's willing talk to opposition parties about kind of changing the rules of parliament which is structured to only deal with COVID-19-relatedlegislation and see if they wereopen to introducing that priorto, in this sort of setting.
I don't know what stage thosediscussions are at. The conservatives would notsupport that legislation and idon't know what form it wouldtake, so it depends whether theopposition parties will, as well.
That would be an interestingmovement, as well.



**Rosemary**:

That definitely was new.
Hard to see how they would reach some sort of compromise in reduced parliament to pass legislation that would be highly controversial for some parts of the country, anyway, who would take issue with a ban on some assault rifles that have been approved or in the hands of somecanadians.
I would be very curious to see how that would happen.
That's the kind of example you would need full representation of the country to best reflect how Canadians feel about gunlaws.
So anyway, but you're right.



**Vassy**:

We don't know many of the details what happened in nova Scotia.
We don't know about the firearms that were used, so that the length between that legislation and the crime that took place, obviously there could be one, but we don't know for certain.



**Rosemary**:

David, I'll let you go where you want but one of the interesting things about the announcement today was the ability or the intent to try to help students who won't getjobs, but to push those students to the places that the economy and society needs the help, whether it be volunteering, agriculture, and I think that'san interesting way to solve couple of problems at once.



**David**:

Two things students are dealing with, lost income and lost opportunity, right.
The summer jobs and the jobs you work part-time in highereducationer certainly help youto build pathways to careerspost-graduation.
You can do that viewvolunteering and getting jobssemi related to your field.
You have a CERB light, up to1750 a month if you'redis-disabilitied.
and then student age changes, they make it easier for peopleto qualify for student loanshelping people pay and there'sthe student employment aspect ofthis.
There was the changes made to the Canada students job'sprogramme rolled out earlier andnow 76 jobs on top of it, thenews release from the governmentsays, this suite of programmeswill create up to 116, 000 jobplacement and other trainingopportunities to help studentsfind employment and developvaluable skills.



**Rosemary**:

So it's on top of the thing from last week?



**David**:

Absolutely.
There's an additional 75, 000jobs on top of the canadastudents loan programme and add sup to 116, 000.
I won't through the math becausei'll get something wrong.
So this tries to cover up some of the system gaps.
The problem, the criticism with the way the government is doing this is there is time gaps.
We heard help is coming for seniors and that's coming soon and so the new democrats, inparticular, saying why didn'tyou just make this universal? it's a question they deal wit hall of the time.
If they had done that, the money would be rolling to all of these people by now through the cerbprogramme but they tried to make it targeted and specific rather than totally universal and giving a pile of money to group of people who completelydon't need it. What they think is an effective way with students is you have combination of methods.
If you finished your program meat the end of 2019, you qualify for the 1, 250 bucks from may to august and you can work and still get that benefit.
My understanding, on seeking clarification from the Prime Minister's office, you can also volunteer on top of that.



**Rosemary**:

Yes.



**David**:

and get extra money up to $5, 000 as compensation for your volunteer time and you can cobble together a decent living which gives you some experience and volunteer service in a time of crisis and a pandemic for the average students.
There will be students with, like, children and disabilities that will require extra help and we need to see the interaction of all of these programmes and the grants and how it comestogether.
It's the reaction on social media from student leaders at different universities and they see this as a big help.
Though, like, everybody in thispandemic, Rosie, no oneprogramme will solve everything.
People are still losing.



**Rosemary**:

To the people ontwitter, as well, saying, well, this is helping me but I still have student loans.
a reminder those loans have beensuspended, at least the federal portion of those loans untilseptember.
and so, it might be enough for many people, but I take yourpoint, with these policy moves, generally there are gaps and as the gaps get exposed, the government does try to solve forthose, as well, because the idea is to make this as broad aspossible.
Although to david's point, if you wanted to do that, the universal income benefit as theNDP Has been suggesting would have done just that but would have captured people making too much money and not in need ofit.
Here is Chrystia Freeland, the deputy Prime Minister with cabinet ministers and let'sbring that to you live.
(speaking french).



We would like to highlight that it's the start of Ramadan.
Please stay home to protect friends and families.
It is essential that we not waste our collective efforts.
Please meet virtually instead.
There are also multiple canadianorganizations that are working hard in order to create virtual community this Ramadan.



This will mark the beginning of the month of Ramadan.
This Ramadan, in order to protect your family, your friends and your neighbours, please stay home.
We must not squander ourcountry's collective hard work.
This does not mean you have to celebrate Ramadan alone.
Virtual gatherings can still take place in many canadiangroups.
They're working to bring together a virtual community this Ramadan.
So today, we will hear fromcanada's chief public healthofficer, Dr. Theresa tam, carlaqualtro, the social Minister of finance and also by video link, the Minister of diversity and inclusion and youth is joiningus.
(speaking french).



and the chair of the privycouncillor, Howard Neil.
Dr. Tam, please.



Hello, everyone.
As usual with the latest number son COVID-19 in Canada, there are now 28, 422 confirmed cases, including 1, 834 deaths.
We are tested over 576, 000people to date with about 6.5%testing positive.
As we continue to make progress in slowing the spread ofcovid-19, we are seeing some bumps in the road that reminds us we can't let down our guard.
We have to act quickly weak points before the virus jumps ahead of us again.
The first hard lesson we learned was seeing how one or two cases in the long-term care settingcould quickly accelerate intolarger outbreaks withdevastating consequences butthis was the start of what'sgrown into a driving fortunebehind the epidemiology incanada's hard-hit provinces.
The risk factors in these typesof settings aren't new.
The fact that the risks aspandemics in spaces with largepopulations that share commonareas and can't maintain optimalphysical distancing are at riskof outbreaks.
If we are to control thecovid-19 epidemic, we mustcontain the spread and stamp outthe burning embers that can leadto new chains of transmission.
To prevent similar outbreaks inshelters and other crowdedliving conditions, we've got tobuild up protections and addressvulnerabilities.
The risk factors in this type ofsetting aren't new.
The fact that in close spaceswith large populations thatshare common areas and can'tmaintain optimal physicaldistances are at risk forceoutbreaks.
and we are to control thecovid-19 epidemic, we mustcontain spread and stamp out theburning embers that can lead tonew chains of transmission.
To prevent similar outbreaks inshelters and other crowdedliving conditions, we have toaddress former vulnerabilities.
To switch gears, I would like torecognise national volunteerweek and express My thanks to the countless Canadians who aregiving up their time to helpduring these difficult times.
Whether you are reaching out bygetting groceries or medicinesfor elders, finding new ways tokeep vulnerable populationsinvolved in programming orproviding care packages andsupport to essential workers onthe road and on the front lines, your support and kindnessmatter, providing much-neededcare to sustain our spirits andshared humanity.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam, and now we will hear from the minister of employment and inclusion, Carla quatro.
(speaking french).



Young Canadians face a series of challenges through this difficult time, whether it be interrupted studies, reduced work opportunities or disruptions to summer internshipplans.
With the suite of measures we are announcing today, we are taking action.
Canada's post-secondary studentsare worried how they will be able to afford tuition and rentif they can't find summer work.
We're introducing a four-monthcanada emergency studentsbenefit.
Students will be able to receive$1, 250, 000 per month between mayand August.
Student ises with permanentdisabilities and dependentscould receive an additional $500a month.
We are here to support you.
This is designed to reach themajority of post-secondarystudents.
In addition, we will fundeligibility for the canadastudent loan's programme forseptember and we will double thevalue of student grants andcrease the cap on studentloans from $210 to $350 per weekof study.
I know that many young canadiansare anxious about the jobperspectives for this summer andthey are looking for jobs instable sectors.
We announced temporary changesto the Canada summer job'sprogramme, and that's just thestart.
There will be trainingopportunities to help studentsfind employment and developvaluable skills this summer andover the coming months and we will create morepaid-workplacements acrosscritical factors like agri-foodand ecommerce.
We will create placements foryoung Canadians in criticalsectors such as canadianservices and investing inbringing important wrap-aroundservices online for the supportof student learning programmes, like mentoring and tutoring toyoung people to make sure theyare not further marginalized bycovid-19. We hope that these measures andothers made as part ofcovid-19's response plan willhelp young people whether theeconomic impacts of thispandemic while ensuring healthand safety.
Thank you.



Thank you, C.R.A. and now we will hear from the associate minister of finance.
(speaking french).



Thank you.
As Canadians are fightingcovid-19, we recognise that many young Canadians are facing an unprecedented challenge.
Students in youth is simple, we have your back.
In addition to the measures announced by My colleagues, we'll provide 291, 000.6 million to support up to 40, 000 student researchers and post doctoral fellows through the councils and this funding would support single semester extension for eligible students who intend to continue their studies but whose research scholarships or fellowships are set to end between March and August of 20. 2020.
On top of the measures announced by My colleagues, there will be$291, 000 in order to support40, 000 students researchers through different federalorganizations.
This funding will allow us to prolong by one semester for students who would like to continue their studies but for whom fellowships -- we know this has impacted students and indigenous youths in a uniqueway.
That's why today's announcement includes 75.2 million in additional distinctions based support to first nations, metisand Inuit first post-secondarystudents.
We know that this pandemic has adifferent impact on indigenousstudents and young people andthat is why $75.2 million willbe offered for additionalsupport based on the differencesfaced by first nation'sindigenous and inuit students.
These new support measures willhelp young Canadians to getthrough this crisis.
This will allow Canada to comeout of this stronger than ever.
Thank you.



Thank you, Mona.
and now we'll hear from the minister of diversity and inclusion and youth also by video youth.
and could we have a bigger image of bartish, please, and be sure she is not on mute.



I think I'm here.



We can hear, but can we try to make the image bigger? start again.
It's perfect.
Here we go.



Good afternoon.
We know that COVID-19 does not discriminate and it has impacted every segment of our society andcanada's youth are no exception.
My colleagues and I, My riding of Waterloo home is home to secondary institutions.
(speaking french).



Young people have concerns which include financialstability, jobs and housing.
Enhancements to programmes and this programme is designed to connect young people aged 15 to30 with opportunities to serve.
We're increasing the number of available micro grants from 1800to 15, 000.
These grants enable young people to design and put into action projects that will make appositive difference in their communities because people who live and work in the communities know them best.
For example, Omar of Quebec was granted $1500 to provide meals to residents severely impacted by the coronavirus.
In the coming weeks, we will launch a new student grant.
Students who get involved to help with the COVID-19 crisis, will be provided with a post secondary cost this fall.
We know that young people have different needs which is why the options have the supports they need to both help the communities and gain skills andexperience.
Thank you.



Thank you, bardish.
(speaking french).



Hello, everyone.
I would like to speak directly to students who are listening to us from home.
Today, our government is putting forward measures that will allow you to weather this crisis.
We are aware you are concerned and we completely understand.
Our youth, our students, our future and we have heard you.
I spent most of My career teaching you and helping you to prepare for life outside of the classroom and I understand that this situation can be stressful and difficult.
We are going through an unprecedented crisis, but with the Prime Minister'sannouncement, as we promised, the government is offering you the support and opportunities that you need in order to get through this crisis and to keep moving forward.
We're teaching students and trying to prepare them for life outside of the classroom and understand how difficult and stressful the situation was before them.
These are challenging times, but with today's announcement, the prime Minister has promised, our government is providing students the opportunities they need to get through this crisis and keep moving forward.
For students in Quebec who are listening to us, I would like to confirm that you will also be eligible for this emergency response benefit for students.
Furthermore, as you know, quebechas it's own system for loan sand bursaries and I would like to be clear.
The government of Quebec will have access to a specific transfer in order to help quebecstudents.
Thank you.



Thank you, jean-yves and weare now ready to answer yourquestions.



**Operator**:

One question, onefollow-up. Please press star 1 at this timeif you have a question.
The first question, please goahead.
(speaking french).

---

**Question**:

Hello, My question is for Mr. Duclos.
Regarding the measures that were announced today for students, you've stated that this benefit will apply to those who would be starting their studies inseptember.
I would like to ask, does this include secondary five students entering in September and does this also include people who may have taken a break from their studies or who haven't been studying in the past year but who would be starting abachelor's or masters degree inseptember? does that apply to them? C.R.A.



Hello.
My answer to both questions isyes.
You can qualify.
If somebody is starting or continuing their studies inseptember, they are eligible.
Perfect, thank you.
and regarding Quebec now, the press conference stated that you would be doubling budget for grants for students and quebecwon't be compensated and how much money would Quebec be receiving to offer its own financial assistance tostudents? who would like to respond? C.R.A. I don't have the exact amount, but I can assure you that it will be fair.
It will double grants and loan amounts and we will be having these discussions with quebecand with the other problems that are not using our system, butabsolutely, this number will be doubled despair.
and fair.



**Operator**:

Thank you, nextquestion.
The next question, please goahead.

---

**Question**:

Hello.
The union for the borders say that immigrants would be able to cross the border and the Prime Minister was not able to answer my question this morning.
Can you talk about these changes to the regulations? I can give you the information that I have.
We renewed the agreement we have with the United States for 30additional to days, so this is ab order agreement.
This agreement restricts only essential travel because ofcovid-19 and because of the realities faced in Canada expect United states.
We made the right decision and we stated that staying home is the best way to maintain the health and safety of ourcitizens.
This agreement, as you know includes an agreement betweencanada and the United States Canada can redirect assylumseekers to the United States.
I would like to assure you that through this agreement with the United states, Canada will maintain all of its international obligations.
I've stated that migrants would be redirected towards the United States because they are not essential travelers.
Do you turn them towards the United states or are they welcomed in Canada? I don't quite understand.
Have things changed?



**Answer**:

No, this decision has not changed and I would like to be very clear.
Canada is taking its international obligations quite seriously regarding refugees including turning people towards the United States.
I would like to reassurecanadians that this agreement that we have with the United States regarding turning assylumseekers towards the United States is not compromising ourcommitments.
That's all.
Thank you.
Next question on the phone.



**Operator**:

The next question, please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hello.
I have a question regarding the distance for students.
Will this be offered to canadianstudents abroad or only those who are here in Canada? why did you decide of theamount, that specific amount instead of offering the same$2, 000 that is offered to workers who are not students?



**Answer**:

I think that is question for C.R.A. C.R.A. would you like torespond.
Yes, students need to be studying in Canada in September.
It is not for students studyingabroad.
The amount of $1250 was chosen because of other services that students have access to over the summer through the canadastudent loan and Canada studentgrant.
Your french is very good, Minister.
My next question has do with something completely different.
Prisons, from the beginning you said you are following the situation and that you are trying to protect thatpopulation.
We were talking about certain areas in which people are too close together and now there are issues regarding situations inprison.
How did we get here and why we were not able to protectconvicts? perhaps Dr. Tam would like to add an answer after My answer.
We stated from the beginning that prisoners are a vulnerable population because of the reality of conditions inprisons.
We are taking this situation very seriously in the differentprisons.
Minister Blair talked about this during our committee meetingyesterday.
We are working closely with provisional authorities, especially in British columbiawe are taking additional measures in order to protect prisoners and those who work in those institutions.
For example, masks were sentforthose working in questions.
Perhaps Dr. Tam would have something to add.
At the public health agency ofcanada we worked closely wit hour colleagues in the province sand territories.
They put a nurse who specialize din prevention in the spread of diseases in order to offer support to prison staff.
We are also continuing to work closely with our colleagues from the different departments inorderto ensure there is aprogramme to prevent infectionsethese programmes in prisons that fall under federaladministration.
Thank you.



Good morning.
I'm with the<I> toronto star</I> . Dr. Tam, we've heard provinceslike Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, talk about their keennessto reopen soon, but looking atthe testing numbers and youremphasis on the need for masstesting before we reopen, canyou talk about what you seewould be the optimum testinglevel.
What capacity do you want tosee, not only now at even 20, 000a day, you said, but the numbersyou post online suggest thatwe're far from widely testing incanada.
So what's the optimum number andhow do you see that unrolling?



Interestingly not -- majority of the countries don't have an optimal number, but we need ab it of a target to work with.
I know that we collaborate across Canada with provisional territory laboratories and that the capacity right now can increase to triple that amount, essentially, to close to 60, 000and we need the whole system to be working and people beingtested.
But there are essentially an increase in capacity being built within the province andterritories.
We're continuing to, of course, provide supplies and figure out all lines of slight, whetherit's reagents or swabs and that happens on a very daily basis and we're able to satisfy the request of the province andterritories.
I think that's just the firstlayer.
We're trying to assert in how much of the point of ca retesting the devices we can acquire and that's the canadiancompany.
But we're acquiring international sources, as well.
Those are expected to be distributed across the country but are targeting at the more rural areas where they can'taccess bigger labs right now.
So we are at the moment working out some of the optimal lab testing strategies go forward.
and that is just on the virus testing and as the serolgictestings come on board, we'll be looking how to assert those and once they're validated, what their role is in the actual support of the diagnostics, as well.
So it is a bit of a target andevolution, but as a firsttraunch, roughly close to 60, 000is where the provinces can potentially expand to as Target already.

---

**Question**:

Just to clarify, that 60, 000 is the national figure per day.
You're not saying in each province that wants to reopen.



That's the national.

---

**Question**:

You mentioned theserologicl testing and I'mcurious you think health Canada's to approving those.
They said they're working with the national lab is have mentioned within week.
So how close are you to having those tests approve and how do you see them working? do you see them as something that is well down the road in terms of assessing populationimmunity? and given the reports we heard about asymptomatic transmission, how crucial are they?



Yes.
So as the first application, ithink, of serologic testing is to detect across Canada, what population had, in fact, been exposed to the virus because we do know that lap-confirmed casesright now of the people who havepresented or who have beentested is the tip of theiceberg, so serolgic testingoffers the opportunity to get ahandle on what the level ofimmunity may be in Canada.
So that's definitely one of thekey objectives.
and I think our lab is workingreally hard at validating theserolgic



I think they're looking at what kind of public health measures can be eased off a bit.
I think as I've said, we have to tread carefully at this point.
I don't think anyone is not heeding that advice, is that we need to see passed the peak and come down the other side of the curve very carefully and anything can happen in any givenday.
So I I think it is something that the provinces are reevaluating all of the time, but the other work I'm doing with the special advisory committee with the chief medical officers of health is looking at some of the criteria from health perspective as to what those indicators might be in order to assist in some of thosedecisions.

---

**Question**:

Can you elaborate, then? is it too soon to be putting ad ate on reopening the economy, first off? and what are the criteria thatyou're dealing with when talking with chief public health officers around the country in terms of evaluating when it'sappropriate to release or reduce some of these public healthmeasures?



Some of the criteria are fairly technical, butessentially, we want to make sure that you're right at the bottom of that epidemic curve.
So indications including things like hospitalizations and cases reported everyday and some of the reproduction numbers.
For example, some of the types of things under discussion, butalso, there's other criteria in ensuring that the health system is ready to absorb more cases should that occur and that anyoutbreaks, in fact, of whether they be it long-term carefacilities and others arerapidly managed.
It's to make sure those measuresare in place and so that'sactually under active discussionand we're working really, reallyhard at that, recognising wherewe're at the epidemic in canadabut do not let go of what we'redoing now.
That's the most importantmessage.
I've said there's a differentkind of epidemic going acrossthe country.
So the timing of some of themeasures and changes in whathappens, there may be somevariations in that, but wewanted to get a nationalapproach in some of the publichealth criteria.
So that's what we're working on.

**Question**:

Good morning.
There's thousands of canadianshere right now that are kind of trapped there and we'rewondering today if there's any plans to have these eight planes from armatrak to come and getthem.
How far along are we on that?



We are very aware of the problems being faced bycanadians in India.
Speaks an a constituency M.P. and there are two other M.P.ssitting here with me and two on video link, one of the things that constituency M.P.s are inclose touch with is the personsituation of Canadians andthat's a really good thing.
and we are working hard to bringthose Canadians back.
I will be candid with you, mike, and with Canadians.
This is complicated andchallenging because of therestrictions which are in placein india around the coronavirusand I do also want to be quiteclear that those canadianscoming back, that is not the endof the story.
Anyone who comes into Canada issubject to mandatory quarantineorders and it is very important, no matter how delighted andrelieved people are to be cominghome after having been in adifficult situation, it isessential that they quarantineas soon as they get here andwe're very focused on that, too.

**Question**:

There were members of the British Columbia's Inuit community trying to arrange delights and that was shut down.
They had permits to get flightsout.
Was that shut down on thecanadian's end, somewhere inindia or do we have any more details on that?



You know, mike, it is delicate and complicatedsituation, so I'm not going Togo into the details, apart from particularly because our objective needs to be not to do anything that would compromise the ability to get people home.
We have very sympathetic with the concerns of people in canadatrying to get their friends and family home and we are workingvery, very hard to help make that happen and I do really want to emphasize the second part of that is people coming home have to and they are legally obliged to isolate for 14 days.
That's very important piece thatwe're committed to. I do want to, as you mentioned British Columbia, thank the province of British Columbia which has been an excellent, very committed partner in ensuring the quarantine of everyone arriving into British Columbia (speaking french).



Thank you, we're going to move back to the phone for threequestions.
The next question, please goahead.
(speaking french).

**Question**:

Thank you verymuch.
My next question is for miss Freeland.
I would like to go back toassylum seekers at the border.
I do not understand.
You're saying that nothing haschanged.
However, in the degree that ihave, one can see that if people come to Canada seeking asylum, that's not included, and can you explain that to me more, please.
I believe we were clear from thestart.
There is an agreement with the United states in order to restrict nonessential travel.
One element of that agreement was a decision made betweencanada and the united states which allows Canada to redirect individuals to the united states to asylum seekers, specifically.
I know there are Canadians and that includes the government that have concerns regarding this process and I can assure you that through this agreement, we are maintaining our international commitments regarding refugees and thatturn-around.
I can assure you that in whatwe're doing, we are certain thatwe are maintaining ourobligations regarding those whoare turned sent to the United States.
Follow-up question.
I just want to understand, madamfreeland, if an asylum seekerarrives at a regular bordercrossing and has no symptoms ofcovid-19, will that person be able to enter the country? and if an asylum seeker tries togo through passage, what willhappen to that person? the agreement that we have withthe United States concernsnonessential travel.
There are a lot of people whocan travel from the United States tocanada and from Canada to theUnited States some of these people are nolonger allowed to enter intocanada.
a new element regardingirregular assylum seekers isthat irregular assylum seekerswho try to take the roxam path, for example, are redirected to the United States.
I would like to highlight thatwe are doing things in a waythat allows us to ensure properturn-around.



**Operator**:

Next question on the phone, please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hi, thank you.
My first question is concerningmodeling.
Canada has been a couple week snow since they revealed modeling data for Canada, but why is the government refusing to release modeling numbers for the indigenous communities?



So I didn't catch the very last part of your question.

---

**Question**:

Sorry.
I was just wondering why the government of Canada is not releasing numbers, modeling numbers for indigenouscommunities.



So I think we collaborate with our indigenous partners and any departments can utilize.
I think just to reemphasize that modeling is a planning tool, so as long it is useful for their planning purposes within I think, I think they can applied.
They have very unique situation sand I think that has to be done in full consultation with communities or individual indigenous first nations andorganizations, as well.
But it is just a tool for any sort of planning or preparednesspurposes.

---

**Question**:

I would like clarification to the 75 million for indigenous students.
is this a part of the 9 billionthat's earmarked for each of thecategories? you said there was money for summer jobs and money for scholarships and such.
is this on top of that? or is this part of it?



C.R.A. I think that's foryou.
Maybe un-mute yourself.



Yes, it is a part of the broader 8.$8 billion package that we announced today, including the programming, Canada student loans, the new benefits and, of course, the service benefit My colleague talked about.
So it's a part of the biggerpackage, yes.



**Operator**:

The next question from radio-Canada.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

I would like to go back to asylum seekers at theborder.
This morning, the union of employees stated that changes happened yesterday and that it was reserved for these assylumseekers so that they might spend14 days in quarantine there before their request wasprocessed.
is that true? thank you again for thequestion.
Our agreement with the United States has not changed.
When we renewed this agreement for 30 days, the agreement was the same -- it's the same as it was in March.
I have not spoken directly with the union.
However, we will be talking with the union or Minister Blair will do so in order to clarifyinformation, but I can assure you that the agreement has notchanged.
Follow-up question.

**Question**:

Yes, thank you.
My next question regardingswabs.
In New Brunswick, Ontario and inquebec, Quebec stated having received swabs that werecontaminated.
Are these swabs coming from the same provider that was problematic last time? can you tell us the necessary measures were taken so thatdoesn't happen again? regarding swabs, they are an essential element for us because swabs are essential for testing.
There was a problem ten days ago with swabs received from china.
When that happened, we made the decision to diversify the services of swabs and now we work with different companies who send swabs to Canada.



**Rosemary**:

We'll pull away from the federal briefing from cabinet ministers giving usdetails.
Perhaps I'll highlight one of the things by Dr. Tam and that'sin regard to testing which we know is key to getting the public health restrictions eased a little bit is she believes the country can get up to 20, 000 a day.
Let me bring in David cochranand again, just more details, really, about how students are being offered some additional supports today, David.



**David**:

It's almost afour-part aid programme forstudents.
An income-replacement programmeto the CERB.
Student aid changes making iteasier to qualify.
Student employment changes andthen grants for volunteering andthe way it works, the incomereplacement is for anybody whois a post-secondary student nowor graduated at the end of lastyear or will be a student inseptember, from may to August, $250, 000 is yours for the takesand that can increase to 1750 ifyou have someone to care for.
Rosie, something I did getclarification on from the Prime Minister's office, you can getthe income support.
You can make a thousand dollarsworking and the volunteer grantsthat they put on the table, people who volunteer in thebattle again COVID-19, you canget a grand up to $5, 000, depending on volunteer hours andyou can get all three.
You can stack the income supporton top of part-time and thatwill help you transition in thetime of crisis and you can getall three levels of that.
That's on top of the doubling ofstudent grants we've seen forlow-income students going intonext year and making it easierto qualify for student loans.
a suite of things designed topay for one of the big cracksleft out of the roll-out of thecerb.



**Rosemary**:

and 75 million formetis and a particular focus onthem.
My thanks to you David and vassykapelos I'll let you know that the federal government saysthere's more support coming are coming forseniors.
I'll turn away from our coverage here in Ottawa and leave you for the day.
Andrew has breaking news that we continue to cover on newsnetwork.
