We'll pull away from the federal briefing from cabinet ministers giving usdetails.
Perhaps I'll highlight one of the things by Dr. Tam and that'sin regard to testing which we know is key to getting the public health restrictions eased a little bit is she believes the country can get up to 20, 000 a day.
Let me bring in David cochranand again, just more details, really, about how students are being offered some additional supports today, David.



**David**:

It's almost afour-part aid programme forstudents.
An income-replacement programmeto the CERB.
Student aid changes making iteasier to qualify.
Student employment changes andthen grants for volunteering andthe way it works, the incomereplacement is for anybody whois a post-secondary student nowor graduated at the end of lastyear or will be a student inseptember, from may to August, $250, 000 is yours for the takesand that can increase to 1750 ifyou have someone to care for.
Rosie, something I did getclarification on from the Prime Minister's office, you can getthe income support.
You can make a thousand dollarsworking and the volunteer grantsthat they put on the table, people who volunteer in thebattle again COVID-19, you canget a grand up to $5, 000, depending on volunteer hours andyou can get all three.
You can stack the income supporton top of part-time and thatwill help you transition in thetime of crisis and you can getall three levels of that.
That's on top of the doubling ofstudent grants we've seen forlow-income students going intonext year and making it easierto qualify for student loans.
a suite of things designed topay for one of the big cracksleft out of the roll-out of thecerb.
