**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'd like you to comment on the horror stories that we're hearing in many seniors homes.
People who are dying home alone, no food, terrible lack of staff.
Yes, this is a provincial jurisdiction, but given the seriousness of the situation, do you sfwoenld intervene and respond? yes.
We're helping the provinces and will provide the necessary support to them.
We are working with them now to ensure that employees who work and have low incomes will receive supplemental income and we are currently putting regulations in place to ensure that our seniors can be protected.
But we all know that this is an extremely serious situation for our seniors and in seniors homes across the country, we're seeing the effects of COVID-19. People who are working in these homes are always doing an outstanding job.
But now it is an even more difficult job.
Follow-up? do you think that Quebec is control of the situation right now? we're taught about a serious lack of staff.
Why have they not been deployed in regards to a potential military situation.
We have received requests from Quebec and we did send in the army.
We continue to work with Quebec to provide as much help as possible.
But we know that Quebec is working very hard to resolve that situation.

Next question, Teresa wright, the kneadian press.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Could you please explain why will you not make the CERB a universal benefit?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We just moved forward with support today.
The Canada emergency response benefit is there for people who lost a paycheque.
We recognize, because of COVID-19, there are many people out of work who were counting on a paycheque to be able to pay for their groceries, to be antibiotic to pay their rent.
Those people are helped by the CERB.
We are moving to ward with direct help for students.
In many cases, school year term ends now, it's around the end of April and normally they would be looking for summer jobs.
This is something that will not happen the same way or as easily this year.
That is why we're moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit.
But on top of that, we will be helping students across the country by creating new jobs where young people can serve and contribute and get jobs.
If they volunteer, we will be rewarding them for volunteering as well.
We need to create a range of measures to support young people and that is what we've done today to the total of $9 billion.
At the same time, we recognize that there are further gaps we need to continue to work on in terms of covering.
We continue to work with allies and opposition parties and partners across areaings of the country to deliver more help to those who need it.



Follow up question?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

The Canada emergency response benefit is already helping many people who lost a paycheque and we need it to help those people.
But we also recognize that students who are finishing their school year would normally be looking for jobs now and for the summer.
They will have a tough time finding one.
They will be creating jobs in sectors that they can make themselves useful.
At the seam time, we are delivering an emergency student benefit to ensure they have money to pay their rent and their groceries.



**Reporter**:

We heard many Canadians who are falling through the gaps.
You said so yourself.
There is a growing push for universal benefits.
Why is this something that you are not doing at this point? our focus at this point is getting help to people who needed it. There are millions of Canadians who need help.
There are others who do not need help and we feel that targeting the maximum amount of help to the people who needed it quickly was the right way to begin to get through this process.
That is what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit that is delivering that help to over eight million Canadians already.
We need to do more, and that is why we're announcing the Canada students benefit.
But our approach has been to give as much help as possible to the people who need it. That is why we took the approach that we did.



**Interpreter**:

Our approach in this crisis and this situation has always been to provide as much help as possible to those who need it. There are millions of Canadians who need the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy so we moved quickly to deliver those two programmes.
But there are other Canadians who do not need help at this time.
These people continue to work and receive a paycheque.
Therefore, we can give the people to those who need it most instead of universal he. We need to be there for each other and we decided to give precedence to the people who need help.



Next question.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like you to comment on the plans of certain provinces to lift the lockdownment they're saying that slowly they have to re-open their economy and this is urgent.
Are you comfortable with the beginnings of this relaxation of rules and will you be giving some flexibility to the provinces in terms of the border with the United States? can you clarify what you meant? for example, could the provinces re-open their border with the United States, before a federal order in council ends at the end of April or is your flexibility meaning to only do that later on? first of all, we all recognize that the pandemic is rolling out defrnlly in different provinces and regions.
Therefore, the provinces and territories will be making their own decisions as to the next steps when I comes to re-opening the economy.
But we are working with the provinces in close coordination to ensure that our principles and our approach are similar right across the country.
So that people will understand what's happening in their area and across the country.
With respect to the United States border, the measures that are now in place until may 21 will remain in place across the country and in terms of what happens after may 21, we'll have more discussions with the United States and probably across provinces on that.
But this is a cross-Canada measure.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We recognize that defrnl provinces will make different decisions about how and where to restart and open their economies.
We will work to co-ordinate so that we're basing ourselves on sheared values, principles and scientific approaches across the country.
Yes, provinces will take their decisions that we will work to co-ordinate in a cohesive story for all Canadians.
In regards to re-opening the border with the United States, that is a federal and national decision that we will kaord naet.
But the national measures will apply across the Canada-United States border regardless of provinces or jurisdictions.







**Interpreter**:

Follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Coming back to the situation in Quebec, more than 50% of the deaths in Canada are in Quebec facilities.
As a quebecer, what does it mean to see this and what can the federal government do other than beefing up people's wages and helping people with rent? what can you do on the ground? to try and flatten that curb and lessen the number of deaths that are occurring? we represent provincial jurisdiction and I believe that Quebec is doing a good job in managing those issues.
But obviously we are there as a federal government to provide aid when it's needed and when Quebec asks us for that aid.
We sent in the c. a.f. In Quebec.
This was a request from Quebec.
We provided direct support through other measures that will help.
For example, regulations with represent to seniors homes that are applied across the country and that are in full alignment with Quebec's decisions.
We are there to be a partner and support Quebec and respond to any requests for P.P.E., for example.
Which Quebec has asked for.
The federal government as its role to play.
But we will always respect provincial jurisdiction and support them in responding.

Next question, line open.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, good morning.
[inaudible] last week decided to [inaudible] to qualify for $40, 000 loan.
It is a welcomed step.
But still there are many small businesses leek small restaurants, convenience stores, Dr. cleaning shops who won't be ever to get this benefit because of many reasons.
These are businesses already struggling and now we have a report that in Toronto [inaudible] won't re-open after three months.
What [inaudible] is being done to help these businesses?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that businesses, particularly small businesses, are facing an extremely difficult teem through COVID-19. and we need to support these small businesses, not just because they are main drao*efers of our economy and of our employment right across the country, but because we need them to be in good shape when this COVID-19 crisis is through so they can come back.
That is why our crisis has been on those who lose a paycheque and their jobs with the Canada workers subsidy and the Canada emergency response benefit.
We also recognize that small businesses, including the smallest businesses need help with access to credit which is why we put in place a 2k4r0r, 000 loan with a $10, 000 nonrepayable element that is going to be helping small businesses significantly.
As you said, we heard from some very small businesses that weren't qualifying at the threshold with $50, 000, which is why we dropped it down to $20 240u thousand, which is the equivalent of one full-time worker at minimum wage for the year.
We recognize that there are other small businesses that are not getting the support they need because of particularities in their circumstance and we're continuing to work with finance and with business associations to make sure that we're giving these businesses the support they need, not just to get through this difficult time but make sure they come back strong at the end of it.



and a follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, the [inaudible] is doing its best to bring Canadians back home.
But there are 50, 000 Canadians stuck in India right now.
Many of them are children.
Families are worried about their well-being.
They're frustrated that the canadian high commission office has not been able to provide them timely help.
Even our high commissioner has apologized to them for this situation.
is the Prime Minister aware of the situation and any immediate help for them?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are very aware of the challenge of cadians wanting to return to Canada at a time when international flights are extremely limited.
We continue to work with governments around the world, including the indian government.
We have welcomed over the past month about 20, 000 Canadians home from repatriation flights.
It is important to be able to bring home Canadians.
There are particularly high demands in some parts of world, including india, that we're working very, very hard, day and night to try to resolve.
There's been many flights back from india, but there is a need for more.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Obviously roxham road remains closed but people coming in to official border points will be able to apply for refugee status and be sent to a hotel.
What exactly is the safe third party agreement Stael in place? we need some clarification on this.
Based on what I know, the safe third country agreement still in place, if there are new directives, we will be following up to give you that information.
But have things changed since last night? not as far as I know.
But I know that Muenster Blair will be able to provide more information as to whether or not there are changes.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Far I'm e I've been apprised there haven't been any changes at the border.
But if there have been, I'm sure Minister Blair would be able to fill you in on those.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

On the question of the guaranteed minimum income, do you not think it would have been simpler to put in place a more universal programme, more open administratively speaking? in other words, create a single benefit rather why not do that? were you afraid of significant abuse? there are some people who think it would have been a simpler solution but maybe not simpler at all in terms of its add mention.
-- administration.
It's not as simple as send ago cheque to every single Canadian, whatever their age or wherever they live.
It is always bit more complicated than that.
and second, and this is the major reason, we decided to help first and foremost, and as much as possible, the people who really need help.
So all of these measures we introduced recognize that people have lost jobs and Lister that income because of COVID-19. It is not their fault and they need income in order to pay for their groceries and support their family and pay their rent.
That is why we chose to move in a targeted fashion very quickly to deliver assistance to these people who need help and that is exactly what we did.
We see that more than eight million Canadians are receiving the Canada emergency response benefit and just announced support for students as well.
and there will be future announcements to help others who need help.



**Reporter**:

Yesterday you cede you would proceed with gun control legislation at the appropriate time.
We've seen other countries, Australia and new Zealand, act very quickly after mass shootings.
Why do you think this isn't the appropriate time? and do you not believe the department can't deal with two pressing issues at the same time?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are certainly looking at introducing the gun control measures that were ready to go but were suspended because of COVID-19. The rules the terms of parliament in a reduced state specifically sate that we need to only introduce measures related to COVID-19 but we will be seeing with other parties if there is an appetite to move more quickly in place given the tragedy we just had.



**Interpreter**:

We were almost in that position to introduce that bill before parliament was suspended.
The conditions of parliament meeting in restricted numbers means that the legislation now that we introduce must be related to COVID-19. But we are prepared to speak to the other part is to see if they're prepared to move more quickly on strengthening gun control.



**Reporter**:

Are comparatively modest compared to other countries, particularly Australia after the port Arthur massacre in 1996.
Are you willing now to revisit the measures before parliament and strengthen them, particularly with regard to ownership of restricted weapons like handguns and certain semi-automatic rifles?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We made strong commitment in the last election campaign on strengthening gun control.
There was



a significant debate in this country that continues between parties in favour of strengthening gun control and other parties that want to weaken gun control.
There continues to be a need for debate but we are resolute that we need to move forward on strengthening gun control legislation in small, common sense ways.
They have no place in our communities, in our country, and that is why we'll be moving forward with legislation to ban them.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Tom Perry with CBC.
You said in your announcement you're making 76, 000 jobs for young people and they will be in sectors that need an extra hand right now and are on the front lines of the pandemic.
We heard about contact tracing, needing people there.
Where will they be working?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we're looking at contact tracing and sectors that need extra support, perhaps agriculture and others.
We will have more to say in the coming days as we develop this.
But we know young people want and need good summer jobs and we're going to make sure that we can get them.



**Reporter**:

You talked earlier about seniors homes and the tragedy unfolding there.
The government has announced support for essential workers there.
Has there been much buy-in? is that helping anyone yet? and do you see a greater role for the federal government in ensuring a standard of care.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We see a couple of provinces, like British Columbia and Quebec, move forward on support for essential workers who are low paid but in important areas like if long-term care facilities.
That is why we are talking with provinces about expanding and supporting them in those programmes.
There have been discussions ongoing with the provinces, recognizing as was pointed out that it is very much a provincial jurisdiction but recognize this is a problem we want help with.
The larger question we're all facing is an understanding that in many parts of this country and many places across this country, the people who care for our most vulnerable are they themselves are the most vulnerable and we need to have a reflection as we get through this crisis and certainly after it on how we ensure that the people taking care of the most vulnerable are not themselves vulnerable.




**Interpreter**:

I think it is clear now that we're working with the provinces to help address all sorts of situations en colluding in seniors homes but we will have to reflect as a country and as a society on how we can ensure that the most vulnerable people are not being helped by people who are also extremely vulnerable.
We need to ensure that people doing that important work of caring for elderly and vulnerable Canadians are not themselves extremely vulnerable economically.



**Reporter**:

Just to follow-up on seniors.
There's been a number of announcements today for students, previously for businesses, etc.
I wofnler specifically in terms of seniors and recently retired people who have lost their savings or substantial amount of savings due to COVID-19. Will there be help for them?



Prime Minister Trudeau's yes, there will be help for seniors.
People who lost their incomes and lost their jobs, that is what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.
Now, as the school year comes to an end in April for university students, we're moving forward with support for university students baz they are going to need help in finding a job, in getting income replacement at a time when they would be counting on money to help them pay rent and pay groceries.
At the same time, even though many seniors continue to have the same fixed income they had from the government from pensions, there are concerns both about their long-term savings, which is why we made change on the rrif withdrawals and recognize that the cost of living has gone up for seniors as they're facing challenges because COVID-19 targets seniors to a greater degree.
So, we're working right now on measures for seniors.
I want to thank the other parties that made excellent suggestions and we'll have more to announce in the coming days.




**Interpreter**:

We decided to give a priority to people who had lost their pay cheques because of COVID-19. With the wage subsidy and the response benefit, we are helping those people two really needed help right away, as soon as the COVID-19 situation began.
and today, because we are coming to the end of the school year for students in the post-secondary education centre, we realise we had to give them help because they will need to find jobs in May or jobs for the summer, so we're introducing the Canada emergency student benefit.
We will also be looking at seniors situations.
We have already brought in some mercks to help them, be we will be doing more and we will have more to say about that in the coming days.



**Reporter**:

Finally, in terms of those awful events that happened over the weekend in Nova Scotia, I'm wondering if your government is looking at introducing federal guidelines or have a deal with an active shooter?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there are many families that are grieving incredible losses right now who are asking how things could have been difference and how they would have been warned earlier.
Those are extremely important questions that I know will be addressed through the investigations and the conclusions.
We need to protect citizens in every circumstance.
and those are something that we'll be talk about in the coming days and weeks.
Merci.
