**Question**:

Hello, My question is for Mr. Duclos.
Regarding the measures that were announced today for students, you've stated that this benefit will apply to those who would be starting their studies inseptember.
I would like to ask, does this include secondary five students entering in September and does this also include people who may have taken a break from their studies or who haven't been studying in the past year but who would be starting abachelor's or masters degree inseptember? does that apply to them? C.R.A.



Hello.
My answer to both questions isyes.
You can qualify.
If somebody is starting or continuing their studies inseptember, they are eligible.
Perfect, thank you.
and regarding Quebec now, the press conference stated that you would be doubling budget for grants for students and quebecwon't be compensated and how much money would Quebec be receiving to offer its own financial assistance tostudents? who would like to respond? C.R.A. I don't have the exact amount, but I can assure you that it will be fair.
It will double grants and loan amounts and we will be having these discussions with quebecand with the other problems that are not using our system, butabsolutely, this number will be doubled despair.
and fair.

**Question**:

Hello.
The union for the borders say that immigrants would be able to cross the border and the Prime Minister was not able to answer my question this morning.
Can you talk about these changes to the regulations? I can give you the information that I have.
We renewed the agreement we have with the United States for 30additional to days, so this is ab order agreement.
This agreement restricts only essential travel because ofcovid-19 and because of the realities faced in Canada expect United states.
We made the right decision and we stated that staying home is the best way to maintain the health and safety of ourcitizens.
This agreement, as you know includes an agreement betweencanada and the United States Canada can redirect assylumseekers to the United States.
I would like to assure you that through this agreement with the United states, Canada will maintain all of its international obligations.
I've stated that migrants would be redirected towards the United States because they are not essential travelers.
Do you turn them towards the United states or are they welcomed in Canada? I don't quite understand.
Have things changed?



**Answer**:

No, this decision has not changed and I would like to be very clear.
Canada is taking its international obligations quite seriously regarding refugees including turning people towards the United States.
I would like to reassurecanadians that this agreement that we have with the United States regarding turning assylumseekers towards the United States is not compromising ourcommitments.
That's all.
Thank you.
Next question on the phone.

**Question**:

Hello.
I have a question regarding the distance for students.
Will this be offered to canadianstudents abroad or only those who are here in Canada? why did you decide of theamount, that specific amount instead of offering the same$2, 000 that is offered to workers who are not students?



**Answer**:

I think that is question for C.R.A. C.R.A. would you like torespond.
Yes, students need to be studying in Canada in September.
It is not for students studyingabroad.
The amount of $1250 was chosen because of other services that students have access to over the summer through the canadastudent loan and Canada studentgrant.
Your french is very good, Minister.
My next question has do with something completely different.
Prisons, from the beginning you said you are following the situation and that you are trying to protect thatpopulation.
We were talking about certain areas in which people are too close together and now there are issues regarding situations inprison.
How did we get here and why we were not able to protectconvicts? perhaps Dr. Tam would like to add an answer after My answer.
We stated from the beginning that prisoners are a vulnerable population because of the reality of conditions inprisons.
We are taking this situation very seriously in the differentprisons.
Minister Blair talked about this during our committee meetingyesterday.
We are working closely with provisional authorities, especially in British columbiawe are taking additional measures in order to protect prisoners and those who work in those institutions.
For example, masks were sentforthose working in questions.
Perhaps Dr. Tam would have something to add.
At the public health agency ofcanada we worked closely wit hour colleagues in the province sand territories.
They put a nurse who specialize din prevention in the spread of diseases in order to offer support to prison staff.
We are also continuing to work closely with our colleagues from the different departments inorderto ensure there is aprogramme to prevent infectionsethese programmes in prisons that fall under federaladministration.
Thank you.



Good morning.
I'm with the<I> toronto star</I> . Dr. Tam, we've heard provinceslike Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, talk about their keennessto reopen soon, but looking atthe testing numbers and youremphasis on the need for masstesting before we reopen, canyou talk about what you seewould be the optimum testinglevel.
What capacity do you want tosee, not only now at even 20, 000a day, you said, but the numbersyou post online suggest thatwe're far from widely testing incanada.
So what's the optimum number andhow do you see that unrolling?



Interestingly not -- majority of the countries don't have an optimal number, but we need ab it of a target to work with.
I know that we collaborate across Canada with provisional territory laboratories and that the capacity right now can increase to triple that amount, essentially, to close to 60, 000and we need the whole system to be working and people beingtested.
But there are essentially an increase in capacity being built within the province andterritories.
We're continuing to, of course, provide supplies and figure out all lines of slight, whetherit's reagents or swabs and that happens on a very daily basis and we're able to satisfy the request of the province andterritories.
I think that's just the firstlayer.
We're trying to assert in how much of the point of ca retesting the devices we can acquire and that's the canadiancompany.
But we're acquiring international sources, as well.
Those are expected to be distributed across the country but are targeting at the more rural areas where they can'taccess bigger labs right now.
So we are at the moment working out some of the optimal lab testing strategies go forward.
and that is just on the virus testing and as the serolgictestings come on board, we'll be looking how to assert those and once they're validated, what their role is in the actual support of the diagnostics, as well.
So it is a bit of a target andevolution, but as a firsttraunch, roughly close to 60, 000is where the provinces can potentially expand to as Target already.

---

**Question**:

Just to clarify, that 60, 000 is the national figure per day.
You're not saying in each province that wants to reopen.



That's the national.

---

**Question**:

You mentioned theserologicl testing and I'mcurious you think health Canada's to approving those.
They said they're working with the national lab is have mentioned within week.
So how close are you to having those tests approve and how do you see them working? do you see them as something that is well down the road in terms of assessing populationimmunity? and given the reports we heard about asymptomatic transmission, how crucial are they?



Yes.
So as the first application, ithink, of serologic testing is to detect across Canada, what population had, in fact, been exposed to the virus because we do know that lap-confirmed casesright now of the people who havepresented or who have beentested is the tip of theiceberg, so serolgic testingoffers the opportunity to get ahandle on what the level ofimmunity may be in Canada.
So that's definitely one of thekey objectives.
and I think our lab is workingreally hard at validating theserolgic



I think they're looking at what kind of public health measures can be eased off a bit.
I think as I've said, we have to tread carefully at this point.
I don't think anyone is not heeding that advice, is that we need to see passed the peak and come down the other side of the curve very carefully and anything can happen in any givenday.
So I I think it is something that the provinces are reevaluating all of the time, but the other work I'm doing with the special advisory committee with the chief medical officers of health is looking at some of the criteria from health perspective as to what those indicators might be in order to assist in some of thosedecisions.

---

**Question**:

Can you elaborate, then? is it too soon to be putting ad ate on reopening the economy, first off? and what are the criteria thatyou're dealing with when talking with chief public health officers around the country in terms of evaluating when it'sappropriate to release or reduce some of these public healthmeasures?



Some of the criteria are fairly technical, butessentially, we want to make sure that you're right at the bottom of that epidemic curve.
So indications including things like hospitalizations and cases reported everyday and some of the reproduction numbers.
For example, some of the types of things under discussion, butalso, there's other criteria in ensuring that the health system is ready to absorb more cases should that occur and that anyoutbreaks, in fact, of whether they be it long-term carefacilities and others arerapidly managed.
It's to make sure those measuresare in place and so that'sactually under active discussionand we're working really, reallyhard at that, recognising wherewe're at the epidemic in canadabut do not let go of what we'redoing now.
That's the most importantmessage.
I've said there's a differentkind of epidemic going acrossthe country.
So the timing of some of themeasures and changes in whathappens, there may be somevariations in that, but wewanted to get a nationalapproach in some of the publichealth criteria.
So that's what we're working on.

**Question**:

Good morning.
There's thousands of canadianshere right now that are kind of trapped there and we'rewondering today if there's any plans to have these eight planes from armatrak to come and getthem.
How far along are we on that?



We are very aware of the problems being faced bycanadians in India.
Speaks an a constituency M.P. and there are two other M.P.ssitting here with me and two on video link, one of the things that constituency M.P.s are inclose touch with is the personsituation of Canadians andthat's a really good thing.
and we are working hard to bringthose Canadians back.
I will be candid with you, mike, and with Canadians.
This is complicated andchallenging because of therestrictions which are in placein india around the coronavirusand I do also want to be quiteclear that those canadianscoming back, that is not the endof the story.
Anyone who comes into Canada issubject to mandatory quarantineorders and it is very important, no matter how delighted andrelieved people are to be cominghome after having been in adifficult situation, it isessential that they quarantineas soon as they get here andwe're very focused on that, too.

---

**Question**:

There were members of the British Columbia's Inuit community trying to arrange delights and that was shut down.
They had permits to get flightsout.
Was that shut down on thecanadian's end, somewhere inindia or do we have any more details on that?



You know, mike, it is delicate and complicatedsituation, so I'm not going Togo into the details, apart from particularly because our objective needs to be not to do anything that would compromise the ability to get people home.
We have very sympathetic with the concerns of people in canadatrying to get their friends and family home and we are workingvery, very hard to help make that happen and I do really want to emphasize the second part of that is people coming home have to and they are legally obliged to isolate for 14 days.
That's very important piece thatwe're committed to. I do want to, as you mentioned British Columbia, thank the province of British Columbia which has been an excellent, very committed partner in ensuring the quarantine of everyone arriving into British Columbia (speaking french).



Thank you, we're going to move back to the phone for threequestions.
The next question, please goahead.

**Question**:

Thank you verymuch.
My next question is for miss Freeland.
I would like to go back toassylum seekers at the border.
I do not understand.
You're saying that nothing haschanged.
However, in the degree that ihave, one can see that if people come to Canada seeking asylum, that's not included, and can you explain that to me more, please.
I believe we were clear from thestart.
There is an agreement with the United states in order to restrict nonessential travel.
One element of that agreement was a decision made betweencanada and the united states which allows Canada to redirect individuals to the united states to asylum seekers, specifically.
I know there are Canadians and that includes the government that have concerns regarding this process and I can assure you that through this agreement, we are maintaining our international commitments regarding refugees and thatturn-around.
I can assure you that in whatwe're doing, we are certain thatwe are maintaining ourobligations regarding those whoare turned sent to the United States.
Follow-up question.
I just want to understand, madamfreeland, if an asylum seekerarrives at a regular bordercrossing and has no symptoms ofcovid-19, will that person be able to enter the country? and if an asylum seeker tries togo through passage, what willhappen to that person? the agreement that we have withthe United States concernsnonessential travel.
There are a lot of people whocan travel from the United States tocanada and from Canada to theUnited States some of these people are nolonger allowed to enter intocanada.
a new element regardingirregular assylum seekers isthat irregular assylum seekerswho try to take the roxam path, for example, are redirected to the United States.
I would like to highlight thatwe are doing things in a waythat allows us to ensure properturn-around.

**Question**:

Hi, thank you.
My first question is concerningmodeling.
Canada has been a couple week snow since they revealed modeling data for Canada, but why is the government refusing to release modeling numbers for the indigenous communities?



So I didn't catch the very last part of your question.

---

**Question**:

Sorry.
I was just wondering why the government of Canada is not releasing numbers, modeling numbers for indigenouscommunities.



So I think we collaborate with our indigenous partners and any departments can utilize.
I think just to reemphasize that modeling is a planning tool, so as long it is useful for their planning purposes within I think, I think they can applied.
They have very unique situation sand I think that has to be done in full consultation with communities or individual indigenous first nations andorganizations, as well.
But it is just a tool for any sort of planning or preparednesspurposes.

---

**Question**:

I would like clarification to the 75 million for indigenous students.
is this a part of the 9 billionthat's earmarked for each of thecategories? you said there was money for summer jobs and money for scholarships and such.
is this on top of that? or is this part of it?



C.R.A. I think that's foryou.
Maybe un-mute yourself.



Yes, it is a part of the broader 8.$8 billion package that we announced today, including the programming, Canada student loans, the new benefits and, of course, the service benefit My colleague talked about.
So it's a part of the biggerpackage, yes.



**Operator**:

The next question from radio-Canada.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

I would like to go back to asylum seekers at theborder.
This morning, the union of employees stated that changes happened yesterday and that it was reserved for these assylumseekers so that they might spend14 days in quarantine there before their request wasprocessed.
is that true? thank you again for thequestion.
Our agreement with the United States has not changed.
When we renewed this agreement for 30 days, the agreement was the same -- it's the same as it was in March.
I have not spoken directly with the union.
However, we will be talking with the union or Minister Blair will do so in order to clarifyinformation, but I can assure you that the agreement has notchanged.
Follow-up question.

**Question**:

Yes, thank you.
My next question regardingswabs.
In New Brunswick, Ontario and inquebec, Quebec stated having received swabs that werecontaminated.
Are these swabs coming from the same provider that was problematic last time? can you tell us the necessary measures were taken so thatdoesn't happen again? regarding swabs, they are an essential element for us because swabs are essential for testing.
There was a problem ten days ago with swabs received from china.
When that happened, we made the decision to diversify the services of swabs and now we work with different companies who send swabs to Canada.
