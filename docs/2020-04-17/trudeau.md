**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past few weeks, the pandemic has created anxiety and uncertainty for all Canadians but some are going through an especially tough time.
COVID-19 has brought many industries to a halt and workers across the country are struggling as a result.
From the start, our goal as a government has been clear -- to help all Canadians get through these challenging times.
As I've said many times before, we're here to support you, to lend you a helping hand when you need it most.
Across the country, Canadians are standing shoulder to shoulder and we're all in this together.
Today, our government is announcing more help for workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador.
We're also announcing more help for small businesses and more help for those who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors.
I'll start with the energy sector.
Right now, workers and families are struggling because of things beyond their control.
Both the devastating effects of the pandemic and price war driven by foreign interests are a challenge.
As a result, companies have had to slowdown or pause their operations, leaving too many people out of work.
To help these worker, our government will invest $1.7 billion to clean up orphan and inactive wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
these wells, which are no longer in use, can be detrimental not only to our environment, but to people's health.
Think of the farmer who can't go anything on his land because of an abandoned well a few steps away from his home.
Think of the small town or indigenous communities struggling with this issuthat has been festering for years or even decades.
Cleaning them up will bring people back to work and help many landowners who have had these wells on their property for years but haven't been able to get them taken care of and the land restored.
Our goal is to create immediate jobs in these provinces while helping companies avoid bankruptcy and supporting our environmental targets.
In Alberta alone, these investments will maintain 5200 jobs.
We listened to the concerns of landowners, municipalities and indigenous commuters who want to make sure that the pollute or pay principle is strengthened and their voices are heard.
I want to thank government of Alberta for working with us and listening to their concerns.
Our government will also establish a $750 million emission reduction fund with the focus on methane to create and maintain jobs through pollution reduction efforts.
This includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador.
This fund will primarily provide repayable contributions to firms to make them more competitive, reduce waste and pollution and most importantly protect jobs.
Right now, many energy firms are experiencing a cash crunch so they don't have the funds to invest in technologies, to reduce emissions or fix methane leaks.
Today's announcement will allow for this kind of work to be done and create jobs people need during this difficult time.
Through the wells and methane initiatives, we estimate that we will maintain roughly 10, 000 jobs across the country.
Just because we're in a health crisis doesn't mean we can neglect the environmental crisis.
We're also working with BDC and EDC To expand credit support for at-risk medium-sized energy companis so they can maintain operations and keep employees.

Our government will be investing $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned and abandoned wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
The goal is to create jobs for workers in the energy sector to avoid companies going bankrupt and support our environmental targets.
These wells, which are no longer used to produce oil may present a risk not only for our environment, but also for our health.
By cleaning them up, we will create jobs for workers.
We will also help people who have these abandoned wells on their land and we are predicting that these funds will maintain electoral college $5200 jobs in Alberta alone.
We develop this policy with the government of Alberta and municipal partners and I want to thank them for their contributions.
Our government will also be setting up a $750 million fund to reduce emissions that will focus on pollution caused by methane in order to create and maintain jobs.
Of that sum, $75 million will be allocated to oil and gas companies who work offshore, Newfoundland and Labrador, to reduce their emissions.
This fund will provide for repayable contributions to companies in order to protect jobs, increase their competitiveness and reduce pollution.
Right now, energy sector companies have cash flow problems, which means that they don't have the necessary money to invest in technologies that help to reduce emissions or repair methane leaks.
Today's announcement will allow these companies to carry out that work while, at the same time, creating jobs for workers during this difficult time.
This public health crisis must not prevent us from taking action to fight the climate crisis.
With this nichetive to clean up the wells and the fund to reduce emissions, we believe that 10, 000 jobs will be maintained.
At the same time, we're working with BDC and EDC To strengthen credit support for medium-sized energy companies that are particularly at risk.
Once again, the goal is to allow these companies to continue their activity in order to keep their employees.



Prime Minister Trudeau's now I want to turn to what we're going to do next for small businesses and the people they employ.
Over the past few week, we've taken a number of steps to support these employers and mostly their employers.
We introduced the Canada emergency wage subsidy to help keep people on the payroll.
We launched and expanded the Canada emergency business account for those businesses struggling with cash flow.
But ministers joly, bain and others have heard that some businesses are still falling through the cracks.
To fix that, our government will provide $962 million to regional development agencies and the community futures network.
This funding will help ensure that more businesses, especially employees based in rural parts of the country or those who don't have a relationship with the traditional financial institution are getting the support they that they need.
There is an assistance programme to support inknow vaiz tos and other early stage development firms that don't qualify for the wage subsidy by still need help.



For small businesses, today we're announcing two further investments.
First our government will provide $962 million to regional developmentings as and to the community futures network.
This is money that will make it possible to provide help to small businesses that don't qualify for the emergency wage subsidy or to receive a loan through the emergency account.
Our government will also allocate $270 million to  and to the industrial research assistance programme to support innovators and other startups that are not eligible for the wage subsidy.
We also have news for people working in the arts, culture and sports sectors.
These are industries which some, like the small businesses I just described, are not able to receive the assistance already announced because their income structures are not the same or they don't operate the same way.
From the beginning of this crisis, artists have been providing us with comfort, laughter and happiness.
Now our athletes continue to inspire us, encourage us and make us proud.
People who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors share their passion with us and allow us to dream and these days, when we're all at home and isolated they make us feel a little bit less alone.
These are only some of the reasons why we have to be there for them.
As they are there for us. Therefore, our government will provide $500 million to heritage Canada to support our artists, creators and the rising stars of our sporting associations.
Through this funding, people will be able to receive wage support and organizations will have access to funding if they are experiencing liquidity problems.



Prime Minister Trudeau's we'll give $500 million to heritage Canada to support those who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors.
Like the small businesses I was talking about, people in businesses in these sectors do not have access to some of help we announced because of how the companies operate or how revenues are generated.
With this investment, people will be able to receive wage support and organisations struggling with cash flow will be able to access financing.
At the same time, we continue to support those who lost their jobs with the Canada emergency response benefit.
So far over 7.5 million payments have been made.
That is money sent directly to those who need it most.
I want to, again, thank My amazing public servants processing these claims at record speed.
Moving forward, we'll be releasing the latest figures on the CERB through the government open portal three times a week so academics, researchers and Canadians can keep track of the work being done.
We'll continue to provide and open up da D that so that we can get the best advice from experts and continue to help Canadians.
I want to end this morning by reminding everyone that today is the 38th anniversary of the charter of rights and freedoms.
Which underpins who we are as a people and strive to be as a people.
It protects the right of each and every one of us to be who we are, to worship how we want, to love whom we love.
At the heart of the charter is the notion of choice, that we can choose the kind of life we want for ourselves.
As our country confront this is pandemic, I'm especially grateful that Canadians have chosen to protect each other and care for one another.
To everyone who has stayed home and followed public health recommendations, thank you.
Making that choice together today will ensure that we remain who we are as Canadians for generations to come.
Merci.
