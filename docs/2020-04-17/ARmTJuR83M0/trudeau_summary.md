### Summary:


From the start, our goal as a government has been clear -- to help all Canadians get through these challenging times.
As I've said many times before, we're here to support you, to lend you a helping hand when you need it most.
Today, our government is announcing more help for workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador.
We're also announcing more help for small businesses and more help for those who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors.
To help these worker, our government will invest $1.7 billion to clean up orphan and inactive wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
Cleaning them up will bring people back to work and help many landowners who have had these wells on their property for years but haven't been able to get them taken care of and the land restored.
Our goal is to create immediate jobs in these provinces while helping companies avoid bankruptcy and supporting our environmental targets.
I want to thank government of Alberta for working with us and listening to their concerns.
Our government will also establish a $750 million emission reduction fund with the focus on methane to create and maintain jobs through pollution reduction efforts.
This includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Today's announcement will allow for this kind of work to be done and create jobs people need during this difficult time.
Through the wells and methane initiatives, we estimate that we will maintain roughly 10, 000 jobs across the country.
We're also working with BDC and EDC To expand credit support for at-risk medium-sized energy companis so they can maintain operations and keep employees.
