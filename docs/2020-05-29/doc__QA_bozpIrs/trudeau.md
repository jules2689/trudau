# PM Trudeau Speech



The rt. Honourable Justin trudeau:... been working with the provinces and territories to keep Canadians safe and address this pandemic.
and this morning I want to begin with an update on where this work stands.
Yesterday the premiers and I along with -- since this crisis began.
We discussed the very concerning reports regarding certain long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec.
The canadian armed forceses report is deeply disturbing, that any senior would face this kind of treatment is unacceptable.
As I said to the premiers, our government will be there to support them as we work togetherto ensure that our elders receive the care they deserve.
In our meeting, we also talked about what we need to do together to help businesses reopen and get people back on the job while keeping our communities safe.
Moving forward, it will become even more important to quickly identify and then isolate this virus.
To do that effectively, we need to coordinate.
a number of provinces have reachout regarding contact tracing and the government has worked together on a data sharing platform and yesterday first ministers were briefed by the work being done by the COVID-19 immunity task force which will coordinate blood test surveys across Canada.
The premiers and I also spoke about support for workers duringthis difficult time.
Our government will continue discussions with the provinces on ensuring that, as we enter the recovery phase, every workerin Canada has 10 days of paid sick leave a year, because no one should have to choose between taking a day off sick and paying their bills.

Our government is also working with the leaders of first nations, inuit, and mÉtis nationcommunities to support them during this crisis.
We have already made all kinds of investment the, whether it's providing loans to indigenous businesses, jobs for students, or services for people who live off reserve, but we are a lot more to be done, and today we are moving to the next level.

The rt. Honourable Justin trudeau:... $150 million to support indigenous communities on health care, income support, and new shelters for women.
Let me start with the first pillar, which is health care.
Although we've immediate progress, there are still communities that are not properly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak.
We need to address that.
That's why we're investing $285 million for public health in first nations, Inuit, and mÉtis communities.
These fubdz will go towards morenurses, will help procure specialized supplies, and will support work with first nations, Inuit, and mÉtis communities on continued community-driven responses.
Having the right health care is essential, but it isn't the onlyconcern facing communities rightnow.
Because of this pandemic, a lot of people also need a hand in paying for the basics.
So as a second pill jr of this investment, we're boosting the on-reserve income assistance program.
This money will support people living on reserve who need help paying for things like groceries, cleaning supplies, orrent.
a portion of this funding will also help first nations communities continue to provide services like skills training and support for people as they navigate federal benefits.
The work being done in communities by members of the communities is incredibly important to help people get through this very challenging time.
That bring me to the third pillar of this funding, investment in shelters.
In April, we found $10 million so that emergency shelters for indigenous women and children could adapt to the new challenges posed by COVID-19. This is vital support in the short-term, but in the long-term, more still needs to be done.
So today I can announce that ourgovernment is investing an additional $85 million for new shelters for indigenous women.
These shelters will be built in communities across the country, including in the north.
No one should have a place to stay when they're unsafe.
No one -- no one should have place -- no one should have to stay in a place where they're unsafe.
No one should be forced to choose between violence and homelessness.
These new shelters will offer a path forward when people need itmost.

Of that ooment, more than $285 million will be invested in health care.
In thees money that will make it possible to increase the number of nurses in first nations communities and buy specialized materials.
The funds can also be used to support the work being carried out in first nations, Inuit, andmÉtis communities in order to find long-term care solutions that fit their needs.
We have also expanded the on-reserve income assistance program to help people pay for their daily expenses, and part of the money under this program will enable to first nations communities to continue to provide a number of important services.
Finally, we are investing $85 million in new shelters for indigenous women.
These new shelters, which will be located in the communities, will provide women with a safe place and the resources they need when they need them most.



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

I want to end today with an update on another measure we've taken to keep Canadians safe.
Earlier this morning, Minister garneau announced that large cruise ships will not be allowed in Canadian waters until at least October 31st.
This decision extend the one we made in March, which was taken to protect our coastal communities.
COVID-19 is still a very seriousthreat.
But with the right plan and with the right investments, we will weather this storm together.
Merci.
