**(Question by Media)**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
I have a question about the finance ministry has updated the cost estimates for CERB and the wage subsidy that shows companies aren't using it as much as you hoped, and it seems they're happy the government is footing the bill for these programs.
is this smaller take-up of the wage subsidy a concern for you and the attitude you're seeing from businesses?



I think it demonstrates how hard this pandemic hit our economy and how many people actually found themselves without a paycheque, which is why we were glad we have the CERB to be able to support millions of Canadians who need help paying for groceries, paying their rent.
But as we move forward, and as businesses start to reopen and need to get people back to work, the Canada emergency wage subsidy will become more and more important, which is why we extended it throughout this summer, and we'll continue to encourage employers to rehire employees to be able to get our economy going once again.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

We realized this situation was extremely serious, and therefore direct help through the CERB did in fact help many, many Canadians who lost their paycheque.
Now, as we reopen the economy, and businesses start up and economic activity resumes, we need these businesses to rehire their workers and hire new ones, and the emergency wage subsidy will help businesses to do whatever they need to do to ensure our economy can recover.

**(Question by Media)**:

So while china has remained quite vocal and firm in pursuing its aggressive foreign policy, with the Meg case we saw continuing on Wednesday, and Canada has been rather avoid ant in using strong words against china, I'm wondering how much more aggression from Beijing will it take for you are to stand up to xi jinping, and are you afraid of him?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We have continued to put Canadian interests and Canadian principles at the forefront of everything we do around the world, including withchina.
We will continue to work to ensure that Canadians have the equipment that we need to get through this situation.
While at the same time expressing our concern for the two Canadians arbitrarily detained in china and continue to highlight our concerns aroundhong Kong and around questions that need to be asked for the W.H.O. We will continue to stand up forour principles and continue to look out for the interests of all Canadians.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

We will continue to raise our concerns with china about Hong Kong and about the detained Canadians, and also what is happening with the world health organization, while at the same time ensuring that Canadians can receive the equipment and the help we need from around the world, includingchina.
We will continue to always place the interests of Canadian and Canadians first, and that's whatcanadians expect us to do. [ end of interpretation ]

**(Question by Media)**:

Mr. Trudeau, this morning we were listening to Mr. Garneau who seemed to be saying that the survival of the airline industry was such that the airlines would not be able to refund Canadians.
Could we be clear what travellers and Canadians about this matter of refunds? because Canadians want to be refunded.
