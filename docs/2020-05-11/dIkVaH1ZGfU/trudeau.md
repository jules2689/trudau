# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Going above and beyond not just these days, but every day.
French french 



**Interpreter**:

I'd like to begin by saying this is the national nursing week.
Nurses are at the very heart of our health care system.
Every day they're doing an outstanding job to keep us all healthy and the way they support people during this pandemic reflects their compassion, their row sill -- resilience and their dedication.
To all the nurses out there, thank you for everything you're doing, not just these days, but every single day.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Since the beginning, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been driven by three fundamental objectives.
The first is to keep Canadians safe and a ensure we take every possible step to protect our most vulnerable citizens.
This work continues daily, guided by our best doctors and medical experts and it drives every move we make.
The second is to protect individuals, workers and families from the worst financial impacts of this pandemic so you can put food on the table and cover your bills while staying safe.
We're doing that with programmes such as the Canada emergency response benefit.
The increase in the Canada child benefit this month and the enhanced g. S.t. Tax credit among other measures.
and thirdly, we're helping canadian businesses through this extraordinary time.
Including for profit, not-for-profit and charitable enterprises to ensure that workers across Canada can keep their jobings.
So we can come roaring back after this difficult time is behind us. 



**Interpreter**:

Today, I AM announcing the next phase of our support measures for businesses which collectively employ millions of Canadians and who have suffered unprecedented losses because of the pandemic.
We will be extending the business credit programme that was initially created so that small businesses can remain financially sound by including mid-sized businesses that need more capital.
Export development Canada and the business development Canada will be working with private sector lenders to increase access to capital by many tens of millions of dollars for canadian companies in all industry sectors and all regions of the country.
We will also be introducing the large employer emergency financing facility to help large employees -- large companies that cannot receive funding through other means to get through this crisis.
But I want to be clear -- this is bridge financing, not a blank cheque.
We're providing support to these large employers in order to protect millions of jobs across the country.
Our approach is based on a number of fundamental principles.
First, we want to avoid seeing businesses go under.
and the goal of the business programme is not to fund nonviable companies and it is not our intention to provide noninterest loans to companies that don't need them.
Second, we want to be fair.
This funding will be accessible to all sectors and to all provinces and territories.
and third, we will protect the people's jobs.
That is the most important thing.
Businesses that receive this assistance will have to make certain commitments and keep them.
For example, maintain jobs and investments, abide by collective agreements and their obligations with respect to pensions and make specific commitments with respect to the environment.
More specifically, there will be strict limits on dividends, share buybacks and executive pay.
In order to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance, businesses will have to disclose their financial structure when they apply for this funding.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today, I AM announcing the next phase of our support for enterprises that collectively employ millions of Canadians and are experiencing unprecedented losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are expanding the business credit availability programme put in place to keep small businesses solvent, to mid-sized companies with a greater need for capital.
Export development Canada and the business development bank of Canada will work with private sector lenders to free up access to capital in the tens of millions, for canadian companies in every industry and in all regions across Canada.
At the same time, we are establishing a large employer emergency financing facility.
To provide bridge financing for our largest employers if they are unable to obtain financing through other means.
But let me be clear.
These are bridge loans, not bailouts.
Just as we're finding ways to small and medium-sized businesses, we'll provide loans to the largest enterprises to help them weather the storm and protect the millions of jobs they provide across Canada.
In providing the support, we'll be guided by several basic principles.
The first is to avoid bankruptcies.
Our purpose is to keep large canadian companies on their feet and protect the millions of jobs they provide.
The goal here is not to fix preexisting insolvencies or restructurings.
Nor is it to provide low-cost lending to companies that don't need it. Second, we will be fair.
Financing will be accessible to every industry sector in a way that is consistent in every province and territory right across Canada.
and critically, we will protect workers and hold companies accountable.
This is fundamental.
Any company that receive this is support will be expected to make and keep certain commitments.
Those include maintaining jobs and investment, respecting collect agreements and pension obligations and environmental and climate commitments.
In particular, there will be strict limits on dividends, share buybacks and executive compensation.
To stand strong against tax avoidance and tax evasion, we will require companies to share with us their complete financial structure as they apply for funding.
With this programme, we're taking a bold step.
Ideally, private sector lenders are adequate for the needs of large businesses.
But in an extraordinary situation, when that isn't always enough, we must act to prevent massive harm to canadian workers and families and the canadian economy.
We will not allow millions of people to lose their livelihoods because of unprecedented events beyond their control.
Finally, as we continue to work on plans to re-open, I want to say this.
Please let caution and medical advice be your guides.
We are all anxious to see life go back to something that looks more like normal.
But we're not out of the woods yet.
and we cannot squander the sacrifices we've made over the past two months.
When in doubt, if you can, stay home.
Avoid gatherings.
Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and maintain two metres' distance from everyone else.
This is how we will keep fellow Canadians who can't stay home and those working on the frontlines safe.
I'm now happy to take your questions.
