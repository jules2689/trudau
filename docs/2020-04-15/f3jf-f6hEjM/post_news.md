**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister of Canada.
Lots of news about what he had to say there today.
Let me point to two pieces on what to keep our eye on tomorrow.
a call to g-7 leader where is the issue of W.H.O. and funding will come up and also a call scheduled with premiers who he's been speaking to on a weekly basis where the issue of long-term care centers is supposed to be addressed to. Let me go to My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
There are significant changes that brought in things far lot of Canadians who had felt kind of hopeless, frankly, and left out.
Lots more will be included now.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
This is definitely a significant announcement and one that the Prime Minister signaled was coming.
The opposition, both opposition parties, but primarily the n. D.p. Have really pushed this issue.
So, the idea of people who were not yet covered by the CERB and specifically what the Prime Minister announced today was those, for example, who earned less than $1, 000 a month.
They will now be able to apply.
That is really ah lot of people, for example, who have seen their income cut.
It was a prerequisite prior to today for accessing the CERB.
In addition, seasonal workers.
We heard a lot from those who don't anticipate that they will be able to access that work and access the CERB.
Also if your e. I. benefits have dissipated, if you no longer have them, you can act access it as well.
and the final point about the call with the premiers.
Long-term care homes.
We have seen some provinces move to top up the pay of people who work in those homes.
The Prime Minister had previously signaled he was looking at a national approach to that.
and there would be some discussion with the premiers around that.
I don't know how specifically that would work or the degree to which the top-up would happen.
I think he had specifics around how much people were making.
I think it was less than $2500 a month.
Yeah.
I think so. So we'll look to see exactly what that means.
But you can see that the focus we've seen from provinces, it is provincial jurisdiction on the issue and what we're seeing on the spread of COVID-19 within these long-term care homes now going to be a primary point of discussion between the premiers and the Prime Minister and I'm curious to see what more the federal government can do. They put out some guidelines but they are guidelines because of provincial jurisdiction.
Are there any moves behind the scenes to up the federal oversight of what's happening in long-term care homes because we know from your discussion from your last guest it is a pretty serious situation across the country.



**Rosemary**:

and it is very unfortunate that it took this pan democrat ticket bring attention to something that clearly has been a pr or for quite some time.
David Cochrane reporting that nine out of 626 Ontario nursing homes received inspections last year.
Almost none of them, frankly.
David Cochrane, maybe get you to go on the W.H.O. There, the Prime Minister was asked about trump suspending his funding to the W.H.O.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Canada won't change its approach based on what the United States has done and the United States has put no pressure on Canada to change its approach.
I want to tip it back to the CERB and the top-up for essential workers.
$2500 a month.
That is $30, 000 a year for an essential worker.
Think about the economics of that.
and what that actually tells us about what's happening in long-term care homes.
This was discussed last week where the Prime Minister said last Thursday that this is something that they -- he wanted to look at and needed to find a way.
I think the urgency of what has unfolded since last Thursday and today has certainly heightened the need to get cash into the system to make sure that more workers aren't compeled to leave and they can entice other people to go in. On the CERB and the expansion of that, they're making it as universal as possible without making it completely universal.
The urgency on getting that done comes from the numbers we saw from the bank of Canada today.
They kept their rate at .25%. but they said economic activity went down, but it will go down 15% to 30% in the next quarter.
Between April and June.
They're expecting a drop of up to 30% in economic activity.
That is why expanding CERB criteria so important.
Seasonal workers, I know in atlantic Canada, the fishery, worried about being able to physically distance.
They may not open because of this.
This is why this is so needed.



**Rosemary**:

and stat scan saying the g. D.p. Dropped by 9%, just in March.
Thank you both very much.
I have to leave you and come back for our federal press conference at the top of the hour.
The Prime Minister broadly expanding that emergency relief benefit so if you had questions whether you qualify, check out online because you might now.
I'm rosemary barton.
You can watch our ongoing coverage at cbc news network and cbc.
Ca. See you tomorrow.
[please stand by]students and businesses who needhelp, there will be more information for them in the coming days, too.
I want to turn our attention to a more uplifting story as we wait for the federal officials, cabinet ministers and public health officials to come up and give us a briefing, probably more details on the CERB and ongoing questions on the W.H.O. Let me bring in the owner and chef at two restaurants in ottawa.
and he's in his kitchen making he hungry and he's been using his expertise to make meals for people in the city, for sheltersi believe, but also essential workers.
Good to see you.



Hi, rosemary, how are you?



**Rosemary**:

Thanks for making the time.
Tell me what you're doing?



Yeah, during this pandemic what we did is just giving meals.
We did 600 meals last week, pretty much every day.
and now it's bumped up to 900 meals every day.
Because the restaurant is closed at the moment and the food is going to different shelters and residents where the people not have a hot meal.
So that is what we're trying to do. Every day the menu changes.
I get a lot of help from different chefs around the city and they come and cook together as a family here.



**Rosemary**:

That's incredible.
That's incredible.
So how are you -- your restaurant shut down.
I know you have takeout and delivery, but how are you affording this? how can you do this at a time when you're not making any money?



Yeah, we're getting donation and the chefs are working and we make the deals with the producers, like Cisco is a good help for us. They gave us a lot of supplies.
So we're cooking together.
The good meal, but the real lessexpensive, but a good hot meal.
Who doesn't want that good meal like that? you know?



**Rosemary**:

You're bringing it to homeless shelters, residences?



Yeah, different residences.
Some of the people who sheltered in different places.
You know, families.
Kids who don't have cooking, don't have a kitchen.
So they're not supposed to get ahoy meal every day, so that is what we're providing at the moment.



**Rosemary**:

and, Joe, I know a lot of people in Ottawa know you and your restaurants and know what you're like, but explain tocanadians why you're doing this.
Why you felt the need to do it.



Because I am blessed to be incanada and running it 16 years, a prospering business.
You know, I am blessed.
I serve the most prestigious people.
I think this is the time we should help the needy people.
and we are here and only thing know is how to cook good food.
So why not give a meal when somebody is hungry, that is the gift you can give, that is karma to do. So that is what I'm trying to do without any -- not much expense, you know.
That is what I'm doing.



**Rosemary**:

Do you think your restaurants will be open when this all over? do you think you'll be able to reopen?



Yeah, yeah.
We're in good standing because we were here 16 years and the community supported us and this is the time to go back.
and I'm thankful that the canadagovernment is doing a lot of good things even for business, the employees and all that.
So once this is over, we will come back and serve the same thing, no problem.
No worries.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to leave it there.
I appreciate speaking with you.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Happy lunch [laughter].



Thank you [laughter].



**Rosemary**:

Wanted to make sure, it is good to take a breather once in a while and reach out and show someone doing something extraordinary in these difficult times.
That's the case for Joe.
As we stand by and wait for the briefing from cabinet ministers and public health, I want to go back to the issue of the world health organization and funding after Donald trump yesterday announced that he would be suspending his funding as largest donor to the W.H.O. Concerns around how china and the W.H.O. Were interacting.
My producer did get the number that justin trudeau did not have, which is how much Canada contributes to the W.H.O. It is about $71 million canadianannually.
HT is the 17th biggest donor just after china actually to theW.H.O. I want to bring in Vassy kapeloson this point.
While he was asked directly about this, the answer was diplomatic to say the least, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I think this is an interesting subject that obviously follows as you mentioned on what the president of the United States announced yesterday, the withholding of funds, of American funds, for the W.H.O. He also, the Prime Minister mentioned, he didn't have the exact figure, but he said they thought they recently increased their contribution due to the pandemic.
So it will be interesting if it's in addition.
He said there was no pressure inthe United States, from president trump to follow suit, but when he was asked specifically -- and he has received this question before, ithink about 10 days or a week ago -- on whether he trusts the data? whether the government here should be trusting the data coming out of china, he didn't specifically address the question.
He talked about the importance of science and the importance ofworking together with other leaders.
He mentioned the g7 call that will take place tomorrow.
But he didn't say one way or theother if the data coming out of china is reliable.
He did echo what he said in the past that those questions could be asked and should be asked andthey probably will be asked, buthe didn't provide sort of a canadian position on the validity of the data coming out of china and whether or not he has specific concerns about whatappears to be a heavy reliance from the W.H.O. Or at least that's how it's characterized bysome like president trump on thedata coming out of china.
The other thing I would bring up, this looks ahead to the press conference, I believe the health Minister patty hajdu willbe there.
I remember on the first day thatthe Prime Minister got questionson this, she received them on the briefing.
Her comments stuck out for me, because specifically she said there is no indication that the data that came out of china in terms of the infection rate and death rate was falsified.
When she received a follow-up, she accused the reporter of feeding into conspiracy theories.
I'm curious to see if her position has changed in light ofthe information that has come out in the past 10 days or sincethose comments were made.
and in light also of the pivot in conversation around the world.
I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that's it's not like people are supportive of the decision to withhold cho W.H.O. Funding.
There has been a lot of criticism of withholding funding, but that doesn't mean people aren't asking questions about china, how they're handledthis, and the lack of transparency there and the W.H.O.'s reliance on the information.



**Rosemary**:

Part of the problem for the W.H.O. is it is only as good as the data that it is getting from countries that haveoutbreaks.
and so it is making decisions based on that information, whichwe now know as david talked about earlier, according to the associated press, was not accurate.
There were, at least if you believe the reports, there was an attempt to withhold information for a period of six days within china.
No one would believe that china is the most transparent country when it comes to information of any kind.
I guess the question people should have and would have rightnow is how reliant or how -- howshould the W.H.O. Operate knowing that fact? knowing that china does not havethe same kind of disclosure and transparency that other countries have? and I'm glad you brought up the patty hajdu situation.
That question, because she was heavily criticized for suggesting that china had been truthful and honest with all of its reporting, but, david, bringyou in here.
It sort of goes to what you weresaying earlier.
This is a very delicate dance and one that Canada finds itselfin with china time after time, whether it's with the Canadians held in prison without charges right now, all these things, we have to manage in terms of how much we need china versus what their impact is in other situations around the world.



**Reporter**:

It's a very delicate geopolitical dance at time of global crisis.
Even when dealing with Michael savor and Michael kovrig cases, and the detentions apparently inretaliation, obviously in retaliation for the detention ofmeng Lanzhou in the huawei extradition case in the United States.
It's key to point out that it's not just people like Jason Kenny or Donald trump and people on the right side of the political spectrum, the conservative side of the spectrum that are cite criticizing.
Irwin cutler wrote a blistering op-ed basically talking about how china's secrecy and the ruleof president xi, the clampdown op the information has allowed the pandemic to accelerate in a way it might not have -- becausenothing is certain when you're dealing with pandemics -- had disclosure happened earlier.
This is where it started and there are clear signs now and ample reporting that there was acoverup of some sort.
and the challenge, though, remains that in the here and nowof today in dealing with this ina country that has not yet hit its peak and a crisis in long-term care homes, Canada does not yet have a consistent and robust enough domestic supply of personal protective equipment.
It needs china.
It needs factories, it needs equipment and those shipments.
While trump can do what trump does because it's the United States and it plays by an entirely different set of rules than Canada can ever hope to play by, there is a diplomacy required here because the planesthat are going into china need permission to land there and thefactories they need to negotiateor pie with them, or the -- buy with them, or the P.P.E., that can Dr. up quickly if the chinese government doesn't like what we say and plays hardball.



**Rosemary**:

I see it on the side of the screen, but let me say it, because the head of the W.H.O. Did have a virtual press conference today and said he regretted the United States president's decision to pull funding.
Called on the world for unity tofight the pandemic.
He said the W.H.O. is assessing the impact and will try to fill gaps with partners.
Again, it's a suspension of money for now, but it could be apermanent decision if the United States administration decides this is not where they want their money to go. There are indications that the W.H.O. is not doing what they want it to do. The Prime Minister saying this will come up in a g7 call tomorrow, with president trump on that call.
Do want to bring in one more guest.
International relief organization, doctors without borders, is taking action that has never taken before.
It is launching an operation inside Canada, inside this country, and the group's executive director joins us now.
Good MO see, you, Mr. Beliveau.
This is unprecedented.
I'm not mistaken.
What made the decision? how did you make the decision that Canada needed help inside our own borders?



Like you said, unprecedented decision.
Normally our group -- I'm sure your viewers know us as an organization that goes to anywhere in the world.
That takes us too places mriek Yemen, the camps in Bangladesh, or Sudan, so it's rare we would consider to intervene in a context where there is a highly functioning health system, where the standard of living is high, where it's peaceful.
So it's exceptional.
The reason we're breaking with tradition, it's a double reason.
The first is that even in a context like Canada where the system is developed, health care is widely available, there are still communities that are particularly at risk and people experiencing homelessness right now in Toronto and other places in Canada are one such group.
and the other reason is because now with decades of experience of outbreak response, we've accumulated a wealth of expertise and knowledge.
So our role -- normally we're out there with boots on the ground, our role here is to share that expertise with other front line actors here in Canada.



**Rosemary**:

How did it come about? was it an offer? or the city of Toronto saying we need help with the vulnerable or homeless population?



Well, it started with us scanning around Canada, looking for the people who would be mo stat risk, looking for the people who might slip through the cracks.
and that pretty quickly got us into a conversation about people experiencing homelessness and then we established a dialogue with inner city health associates.
So that's who we're collaborating with on this project together with the health authorities here in Ontario.



**Rosemary**:

and what will you be doing specifically? there is a 400-bed facility and people will be housed there and made sure they're staying healthy and doing the right thing, is that the idea?



Basically.
So it's a recovery site.
It's for people who don't have homes who test positive.
Right now is a really critical moment for this.
In the last days there has been a real uptick in the number of positive cases among toronto's 8, 000 to 10, 000 people without homes.
Critical moment to get a facility set up. As you said, we're planning for 400 beds.
To get that facility set up so they can be cared for.
Unless they're in acute phase.
They can access the hospital system then, but we want to make sure they can go somewhere to get treatment, safe, practise physical distancing and get proper care.



**Rosemary**:

Unprecedented time sand you're doing something unprecedented inside this country.
It's a really good idea, though.
Thank you for speaking with us. and good luck with it and stay healthy, thank you very much.



**Rosemary**:

Let's go to the deputy Prime Minister.
Let's listen in live.



Dr. Tam, please.



Hello, everyone.
I'll start as usual with the update on the number of COVID-19cases in Canada.
There are now 27557 cases including 954 deaths.
These numbers change throughout the day.
For the lab testing we've completed tests for over 462, 000people with about 6% confirmed positive as Canada continues to improve our testing to better track where the disease is spreading.
As Canadians continue to practise physical distancing, we're closely monitoring for signs that our efforts are having an impact on the epidemiccurve.
It's taken just over three months for the first cluster of COVID-19 cases in china to spread globally and establish a pandemic.
It is hard to take in how our life has changed in such fundamental ways over this shortperiod.
At this point we still don't have all the answers, but there is cause for cautious optimism coming from our epidemiological data.
Because COVID-19 is very contagious, even a few cases canquickly multiply resulting in a steeply rising epidemic curve.
This type of increase is referred to as exponential growth with case numbers doubling every few days.
In late March when the growth rate was the fastest, we saw case numbers doubling every three days.
In recent days we've seen a doubling time over 10 days.
This means the epidemic is slowing down.
Though we all wish this could bea sprint to the finish, it is not.
There will be marathon and no rewards for quitting early.
To use another analogy, coming down from this curve will be like making our way down a mountain in the darkness.
We must not rush.
We need to remind ourselves thisis an emerging disease and that we don't know everything, so theterrain will be uncertain.
That means we need to go slowly and be sure of our footing before taking each new step on the way down.
Along the way, we'll need to closely monitor cases and growthtrends to ensure we've got the right public health measures in place to detect the and quickly respond to any new cases or clusters.
We'll need to maintain physical distancing during this time.
Any break in our resolve could spark a new outbreak and delay our progress.
So let's maintain our collectiveresolve and crush this curve.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.



Now Dr. Njoo.
[voice of interpreter] thank you.
Hello, everyone.
I'll begin with the number of cases of COVID-19 in Canada.
There are 27, 557 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 954 deaths.
These numbers changed through the day.
As for lab testing, we've completed tests for over 452, 000people, about 6% of whom have been confirmed positive.
Canada continues to improve testing to better track where the disease is spreading.
As Canadians continue to practise physical distancing, weare closely monitoring for signsthat our efforts are having an impact on the epidemic curve.
In just over three months, the first cluster of COVID-19 cases in china spread globally and established the pandemic.
It is difficult to take in how our lives have changed in such fundamental ways in such a shorttime.
At this point, we don't yet haveall the answers, but there is some cause for cautious optimismcoming from our epidemiological data because COVID-19 is very contagious even a few cases can quickly multiply resulting in a steeply rising epidemic curve.
This type of increase is referred to as exponential growth.
This means that case numbers candouble every two or three days.
In late March when the growth rate was the fastest, we saw case numbers doubling every three days.
In recent days, however, we've observed a doubling time of about nine or ten days.
In other words, this means that the epidemic is slowing down.
Though we all wish this could bea sprint to the finish line, it is not.
This will be a marathon.
There are no rewards for quitting early.
I'd like to use another analogy.
Coming down from this epidemic curve will be like making our way down the mountain in the darkness.
We need to remind ourselves thatthis is an emerging disease.
We don't know everything which means that the terrain will be dangerous and uncertain.
That means that we need to go about this slowly and be sure of our footing before taking each new step on the way down and outalong the way.
We will need to closely monitor cases and growth trends to ensure we've got the right public health measures in place to detect and quickly respond toany new cases or clusters and toreact quickly.
We'll also need to maintain physical distancing during this time.
Any break in our resolve could spark a new outbreak and delay our progress.
So, let's maintain our collective resolve.
Let's crush in curve.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Njoo.
Patty, please?



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:

Thank you.
Hello everyone.
[voice of interpreter] today, I'd like to talk to you about mental health.
It can be difficult to maintain good mental health with all the disruptions we're currently experiencing.
It can be difficult to maintain routines.
Last week we talked about modelling.
It was a very shocking exercise for some.
We heard how the virus could continue to spread in Canada if we don't all continue to follow public health advice.
[end of translation] living through a pandemic is not easy.
Many people are struggling with fear, anxiety and loneliness.
and not being able to use our regular support networks or practise regular routines means people are struggling all acrosscanada.
and they need tools to help, including with their mental wellness and health.
As of today, all Canadians have improved access to mental healthsupports through online resourcecalled wellness together Canada.
You can check out the new suite of tools at Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
This has different tools available to meet the variety ofcanadian needs.
Whether it's anxiety, sadness orsubstance use, there is something there for you.
The options include an online peer community to talk and shareand support others.
There are also a number of self-help resources to help withanxiety, stress or other issues.
and there are options such as texting, calling or connecting by video for a session with a professional to address a specific need.
I encourage all Canadians to explore wellness together Canada, to use its resources andreach out virtually to loved ones.
Now more than ever we need to stay connected.
Thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, patty.
Now we'll hear from the minister of employment, workforce development Carla qualtrough, joining us over video link.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Hello, Bonjour.
[voice of interpreter] as I've said since the beginning, we have been committed to supporting all workers impacted by COVID-19. That is why we introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, the CERB.
[end of translation] some workers qualify and we're stepping the eligibility criteria for the benefit.
As announced by the Prime Minister this morning, we're extending the eligibility of thecerb to allow workers including the self-employed to earn up to 1, 000 a month.
Some workers exhausted their e. I. benefits and including seasonal workers who exhausted their e. I. benefits.
[voice of interpreter] these changes reflect the different realities that working Canadians are currently experiencing.
We know that people want to remain in the workforce, but have seen a dramatic loss in hours and income due to COVID-19. [end of translation] the changesannounced today will increase the number of workers we can help, including those with some income, but not enough to make ends meet.
The CERB will give them the support they need.
We know that Canadians who have been collecting e. I. do not havejobs to return to and benefits have already run out or will soon.
These people need our support and now will be eligible to the CERB.
We want to ensure our essential workers are supported during this critical time.
They're working day in and day out at hospitals, care facilities, and senior and long-term care homes, and we know the sacrifice you're makingto keep us safe.
That's why the Prime Minister announced he and Minister morneau are providing a top-up to salaries of workers making less than $2500 a month.
[voice of interpreter] we know that this is a stressful time for many.
We will continue to look for ways to ensure that we help all Canadians during this difficult time.
and I'd be happy to take your questions thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, C.R.A. [voice of interpreter] now we'll hear fromthe president of the treasury board, jean-yves Duclos.



This morning the Prime Minister made an important announcement.
The announcement puts things into perspective.
The economy has been significantly disturbed which has led the government to take unprecedented economic action and pass unprecedented measures.
We have had to strengthen our social safety net.
This is the most substantial economic action since the second world war.
and today we are expanding one part of the government's three-part economic action plan.
The Canada emergency response benefit.
So now those earning $1, 000 or less, they've heard from the Prime Minister today they will now be eligible for the CERB.
and those who have lost their income or lost most of their income, for example artists, theself-employed, freelancers, today we're helping those who are still making some income butare having difficulty making ends meet.
Their income is much, much decreased.
This can include volunteer firefighters who are also working reduced hours.
Today our announcement is very important.
All of these individuals I just listed, all of these groups willnow have access to the CERB backdated to March 15th.
and for those who were worried about juggling taking care of their health and their families, for example seasonal workers, and also those who have lost their jobs in the past few months and those who have lost their e. I., employment insurancebenefits since the first of January, they will also be eligible for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB.
Our thoughts are with essential workers in quÉbec and in Canada.
Our thoughts are with those who are caring for our seniors.
They're working in very difficult circumstances and may be earning less than $2500 a month.
Prime Minister trudeau made another announcement this morning.
He announced that we will be helping these people.
They will receive a temporary salary top-up so that they can continue to do the essential work that we need in our society, taking care of seniors and others in need of care.
Thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you.
We're now ready to take questions.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
We'll start with three questions over the phone line.
Operator? [end of translation]



Please press star 1 if you have a question.
[voice of interpreter] the first question.
Question, hello, Minister jean-yves Duclos, I have a question about the CERB and the announcements.
Here's My first question.
What will the total bill for thecerb, how much will it cost the federal government, especially given these new expansions? and how many additional Canadians do you think will be eligible after today's announcement?



Answer.
Thank you very much for the question.
Ministers will have more answers in the upcoming days.
Here's what is essential.
We're making sure that no one falls through the cracks.
We want our social safety net to help as many people as possible.
That's why we're expanding the CERB.
QuÉbec has announced measures to help its workers in care homes and we are following suit.
Seasonal workers are also extremely important in Canada in the east, in quÉbec.
Seasonal workers at this point in time would normally have seasonal work, but that won't Bethe case this year.
We're also trying to help workers who have lost almost all of their contracts.
We're trying to help self-employed workers and those who have seen their income drastically cut.
Workers will still be able to have a few contracts all while being eligible for the CERB.



**Reporter**:

Follow-up question.
My first question was, what is the total bill that you estimatethe new CERB will cost given it's been expanded to include more workers? how much now do you estimate it will cost? how many more people do you estimate will qualify for the CERB now with the changes that you announced today? My follow-up, then, is concerning the hiking of the salaries for essential workers.
Can you clarify which essential workers you are looking at? is it just for long-term residences or is it other sectors? is it only health sector? can you clarify? and will quÉbec get money from the top-up given they've alreadystarted topping up their own essential workers.



Thank you for the questions.
First of all, with respect to --it's a little premature based on the fact that we don't know the up take of the wage subsidy.
We want employers to hire peopleback.
We want people to switch from the CERB to the wage subsidy.
So right now we're estimating while the standard eligibility criteria will indeed allow more people to access the CERB, there will be less people on the CERB once the wage subsidy is fully implemented because ultimately we want people to go back to their work, their jobs, and be connected into the labour mark etas we transition out of this.
In terms of the essential workers piece, I'll defer to the deputy Prime Minister because I know her colleague Minister morneau and herself are working on this issue.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, C.R.A. On the top-up for essential workers, this is an effort that we are working on collaboratively with the provinces.
The Prime Minister first broached it with the premiers atthe -- on the first ministers' call on Thursday.
There was an enthusiastic response and since then I've spoken about it with a few premiers, the Prime Minister hascontinued to be working on it, and the finance Minister has been working on with his colleagues.
The Prime Minister intends to make this one of the key issues that we discussed and hopefully come to a resolution on quickly at the first ministers' call with the premiers tomorrow.
The idea this would be done collaboratively by the federal government and the provinces.
[voice of interpreter] marie, you mare right in stating that quÉbec hasalready taken action on this matter.
QuÉbec has set a great example for the federal government and for other provinces.
and quÉbec will absolutely not be penalised for being the firstprovince to act.



The next question please.
[voice of interpreter] next question.
Radio-Canada.
Question.
Hello.
There is something I'm trying tounderstand.
What about the armed forces helping in long-term care facilities? I understand that we have to wait until the provinces formally request such assistance, but what are you, the federal government, doing with the canadian armed forces? how can you help the provinces with their long-term care facilities? answer.
Minister Duclos.
The canadian armed forces can help in a whole host of ways.
Prime Minister trudeau said today that the rangers are hard at work in Canada's north.
They are helping out logistically, helping people travel and move around.
They are helping municipalities.
They are also helping out with safety and security in Canada's north which is sparsely populated but has a vast territory.
Now, as for medical assistance, as for the canadian armed forcesintervening to help medically, well, the canadian armed forces can help out substantially when it comes to health.
They would, if necessary, step into support provinces and territories, but that would have to follow, as you said, a formalrequest from quÉbec or the province.



Follow-up question.
Candidly speaking, what could they do? and if quÉbec for example requested that the army step in tomorrow, could the army then step in this week? because people are dying now.



Answer, Minister Duclos.
We must work with provinces, quÉbec and all provinces are working very hard to cope with the public health emergency that we are experiencing and the situation is particularly dire in long-term care and assisted-living facilities.
We are trying to ensure that everyone receives the help and support they need and the canadian armed forces are a support.
They are there to help and support when the provincial government, so in this case quÉbec, makes a formal request for the assistance of the canadian armed forces.
Thank you very much.



Next question.
[voice of interpreter] our next question is from tva news.
Question.
I have a question on the same topic, Minister Duclos.
Can you confirm that quÉbec has not formally requested the canadian armed forces? so is it the case that quÉbec has not specifically made a request?



Answer.
Minister Duclos.
Yes.
That is accurate.
Now talks are under way between the quÉbec government and the federal government.
and these discussions could potentially lead to a formal request.
We will always listen to the needs and requests of the quÉbecgovernment.
If quÉbec requests assistance from the Canadian armed forces or from the medical corps of thecanadian armed forces, then that will be possible.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

[voice of interpreter] I would like to restate that we have not received such a requestfrom the government of quÉbec.



**Announcer**:

Follow-up question.
This question is from Dr. Njoo.
We know that science is constantly evolving when it comes to wearing a mask.
Where are we now, what is our stance now on wearing masks? especially for the general public.
In the upcoming weeks will health Canada require that Canadians wear masks when they leave their homes?



Answer.
Dr. Njoo.
Thank you for this question.
This is a live issue, a dynamic issue.
It's constantly evolving.
Dr. Tam and I a few days ago Hadar very good conversation with the other members of Canada's special advisory committee on COVID-19. When it comes to non medical masks for the general public, we have to in fact distinguish between non medical masks and medical masks.
Medical masks are essential P.P.E. For health care workers.
As for the general public, our stance is that wearing a mask isfine.
We have advised that Canadians only leave their homes when it'sabsolutely necessary to do so. and when Canadians go somewhere where it is not possible to practise physical distancing, for example on public transit orthe grocery store, then wearing a mask is a good option, yes.
But when we wear nonmedical masks, we're protecting others.
When we wear nonmedical masks inpublic, it is because that is anaction that we can take to protect others.
However, these nonmed masks do not protect us from others, so our stance has not changed in that sense.



Julie van dusen, CBC us. Dr. Tam, when you said the epidemic is slowing down, My ears perked up, but is there any reason to get optimistic about this when it doesn't sound like there can be any change in behaviour?



Yeah, I think cautious optimism.
I think what we're doing is working.
You're seeing that slowdown, bu ti didn't say we reached the peak.
I've always said on the other side of the peak you have to be really vigilant.
If you do not, then you experience a resurgence.
We have many challenges still to deal with, including managing the outbreaks in long-term care facilities, et cetera.
So I do think that, you know, the epidemic growth rate has slowed for sure.
But the main message for all Canadians is actually not to letgo.
let's never give up. Term this is not the moment to give up. We're doing a great job.
Let's continue that until we getto the bottom of the hill and a look at what the new normal would look like.



**Reporter**:

I guess My second question would be for Mr. Duclosor perhaps the deputy Prime Minister.
We talk a lot about nursing homes and it seems to be a lot of talk and not a lot of action.
Canadians are devastated by what is going on and there are those who can't visit their loved ones.
We know that we would never let a pet suffer this way much less a loved one.
So you call it a war and a lot of people are wondering, where are the soldiers, why don't you send them in? perhaps the red cross on a humanitarian mission, to serve meals, what possible bureaucratic excuse could there be not to?



I'll start and certainly the deputy Prime Minister can add if she wishes more.
First of all, I agree with the assessment that we have to do a better job collectively as governments.
This is no secret to people, as I said yesterday, people who have experienced a loved one who lived in long-term care, there are variety of different levels of care, but some of them are atrocious as you pointed out.
This is an opportunity for all of us, at all levels of government, to reflect how we'lldo a better job.
In terms of our immediate response, I've had conversationsboth with My -- both counterparts, Minister elliott from Ontario and Minister mccannfrom quÉbec to talk about how we can support them in the short-term, including as we mentioned, resources to top-up wages for long-term care workersso that they have what they needto stay in one place and not have to work in multiple places over multiple sites.
But also helping them with the significant human resources crunch they're facing right now.
So health Canada has --s I thinki announced a couple of weeks ago -- a portal that thousands of Canadians have applied to help.
So we're working closely with Ontario and quÉbec to match themwith the appropriate resources to support them in long-term care homes and other ways that they might need within the health care system.
In fact, just checked with My deputy and there is about a thousand people right now that would be available to support quÉbec that speak both official languages.
So that work is happening right now.
I think there is two stages.
There is a short-term stage which is doing what we need now to put the tangible pieces into place that will protect people living in long-term care homes, but also people working in long-term care homes.
Then secondly, how we work together to build up a much morehumane system for all people aging in Canada.



Mari eke Walsh, "the globe andmail". how many warehouses are stockpile locations do we have across Canada? and how has that changed in the last 20 years, up or down?



I'll turn that to Dr. Tam.
Believe it or not before the pandemic, she was the Minister of health for a month and a half, so I don't have the history you're perhaps looking for.
Perhaps Dr. Tam does.



Yes.
So I think in the past decades, they stockpiled a lot of things, blankets and that material.
Those were reduced over time because other people can provide some of those, but we still deploy them and they are scattered across the country.
and we have at least five regional warehouses for general supplies.
But the stockpile over the years has been focused on stockpiling very strategic medical supplies that nobody else actually holds.
and those are very specialized and it's held in one single warehouse basically where there is very specialized conditions to maintain those medications orvaccines.



**Reporter**:

Can you just confirm, does that mean there are a total of five warehouses in Canada? and what was the hi rest number? and My -- highest number? and My follow-up question on thecbc reporting that the warehousein regina was closed and masks were thrown out.
Were those masks replaced? and why was that specific warehouse closed?



I asked My officials that question this morning when I read the story about the destruction of expired masks in the Saskatchewan warehouse.
and we'll be reviewing the practises of what we do with equipment that is near to expiry because I believe there is probably a more effective way to use equipment that is nearing its expiration date.
Certainly that was pre-pandemic and I understand the reluctance of public health agency of Canada to distribute equipment that has expired in normal times, because the first focus is the safety of the people thatuse the equipment, but there maybe opportunities -- I'm certain actually there is opportunities to look at a process where equipment is offered first of all to either parts of Canada that may not have easy access to the equipment, and if not, then overseas to other countries thatmay need it. Actual physical building, but there is essentially -- but we'll absolutely verify that.
Even for me, some of those changes because of logistical requirements, we'll definitely confirm that.



Thank you.



If I can add one more thing.
When I asked about the nature of the warehouses early on, I will say that they are considered to be an issue of national security, so releasing the exact location of warehouses is not a practise that the government of Canada has ever had because, of course, these are strategically important resources during times of pandemic or other disasters.



Hi, it's Annie bergeron Oliver.
The percentage of people testing positive is increasing.
In April we were around 3.5% and at that point you said that was a good range for Canada to be in. Now we seem to be hovering around 6%. I wonder what attributes for the change in percentage and whethercanadians should be concerned that more people appear to be testing positive for the coronavirus?



Yes, I think the percentage positive is a combination of different factors.
One is how the provinces are targeting the testing.
Obviously, targeting situations where there are outbreaks, that will get you more percentage possibly, about you what with e -- but what we want is a more significant system where people with symptoms are still tested.
So you still have 94% that are not positive.
So it shows that the country is still testing a lot of people who in the end didn't turn out to be positive, about you that shows a -- but that shows a certain amount of sensitivity in the system.
But that is also composite of the country.
So those might be different depending on the location of the jurisdiction because of the different epidemiology as well.
So it's a combination of things.
I think globally what is suggested is between 3-12% is the sort of range that people have been using as a system that has the right balance of targeting the right population, but also being sensitive as well.
But we've all said we need to improve the lab capacity in Canada.
and we're going to continue to do that.



**Reporter**:

As a follow-up, every day it seems like we're hearing more cases of health care workers who are infected.
I'm wondering, one, if you have an exact picture of how many health care workers across the country are infected? and, two, what is the federal government doing to ensure that hospitals have the staff they need as more health care workersget sick and the same for long-term care facilities?



First of all, I'll turn to Dr. Tam to speak about specifics in a minute, but I will say that the work we do around staffing of hospitals and process and protocols for hospitals is at the technical guidance level.
Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo as you know sit on the advisory committee which is comprised of all of the public health officers across the provinces and territories and it's where it's developed across the country.
The federal government has provided a number of resources.
I always say we're able to provide money, which we have to provinces and territories.
We are able to provide equipment, which we have to provinces and territories.
and guidance.
That is really the role of the federal government.
and of course any other extra special requests that each province and territory poses like, for example, human resource support, we are working diligently to provide that as well.
I don't know if that is completeenough, but I can give it to Dr. Tam to speak a few extra words.



I think it is actually quite important to look at the number of cases in health care workers which the provinces have much more detailed information on. After provinces have provided us with information that we can glean the percentage of cases that have been in health care workers ranges somewhere between the 7% to sometimes 11%. and in general the exposure setting, if you like, is actually quite varied.
a lot of of them are actually infected not at the workplace --sometimes it's due to travel, attendance at a conference, attendance at mass gathering events and certainly in social context as well.
I think that tells us of course we need to protect health care workers both at the workplace, but it's also important for them to reduce all the risk of acquiring infection elsewhere as part of the other daily life as well.
So I think both aspects.
Of course, travel and mass gatherings have been reduced.
I know of even one cluster where it involved a funeral setting where there was some health care workers as well.
So it's varied in terms of where they acquire infection.
We know today of one health worker who, unfortunately, died with COVID-19. It's unclear, I think, where that worker who is I this an environmental staff had acquired the infection and it may not be the workplace.
It may be the community, but it's under investigation by the jurisdiction itself.
So I do think, it is something that we are monitoring in every area of Canada very closely.



**Announcer**:

Thank you, doctor.
Turn back to the phone for two last questions.
Operator?



Thank you.
The next question from Canadian press.



**Reporter**:

For Dr. Tam, it seems many say that a rapid testing capacity many times what we have in Canada right now is requirement for a return to anything like normal.
First, do you agree with that? if you do, can you lay out in detail what is being done to get us to that point?



So I think certainly when there are bigger outbreaks or clusters, you can -- what your trying to determine is if an outbreak is occurring and looking at community transmission.
When we get to epidemic control of the first wave, which is our collective objective and our goal, you have to have laboratory testing.
You have to have good testing systems to detect reigniting and sparks and clustering reoccurring.
So for sure ramping up our capacity in anticipation of that period of time where we had to detect further change in transmission is very critical.
So we are doing this in a number of ways.
One is every single day looking at every avenue to increase our capacity to do the detection for the virus, which is mainly the OCR test.
So those are the tests that could be done in bigger laboratories, but the rapid testthat.
Including that, and of course, domestic supplies such as the spartan company that is providing -- this is one that health Canada had recently approved.
So trying to get as much of that diagnostic on board and that would be really a sort of great component of our strategy for those who are more in the remote and rural areas, indigenous communities, because that will eliminate the transportation time for any specimens.
But for sure any of those type of tests we're pursuing.
Making agents, ensuring we have swabs, all those things are being worked on. We have to thank the laboratory people by the way today.
and all that they're doing to help us in this outbreak.
Also then, of course, we are examining the antibody tests.
and people have asked us that, you know, about that in the past.
and we are actively testing some of those kits, doing quality assurance, making sure that they can actually detect antibodies and then further understanding the immunology of the virus.
I think all of those are streams of capacity-building that are relevant.



**Reporter**:

Thanks.
For Minister hajdu.
What do you make of the United States president's lament about the world health organization and the withdrawal of funding? how will this affect the fight against COVID-19?



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:

Well, I think Canada values the work of the world health organization.
and we continue to commit to contribute towards the work of the organization.
It is a very valuable tool in regular times, in both its ability to detect new virus activity, to manage outbreaks of variety of different diseases around the world, to bring scientists and researchers together, to allow the capacity for countries to work together, to deal with these types of outbreaks, so we commit on a regular basis through the presence of Dr. Tam as one of the expert advisors to the committee, the special committee on COVID-19. and we know that any response tocovid-19, and in fact any global outbreak is one where countries have the capacity to pull together, pool their research and to really share their efforts to manage these outbreaks.
It will happen again and again by the way.



Thank you, Minister.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.



Following question from politico.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Thank you for take My question.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that border restrictions are going to be needed for weeks.
Many states in the United States have extended stay-at-home orders.
How long is Canada looking to extend the current limitations in place for people, non-essential people not crossing the border.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you for the question, Lauren.
You will have heard from Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo they're cautiously optimistic when they look at the doubling rate of coronavirus.
[please stand by]we are going to be very careful.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. We're going to leave this federal briefing and Chrystia Freeland but let me reiterate the news that she is referring to there, that there is some cautious optimism, that the strict measures of physical distances and staying at home do appear to be working.
Much time yet to go. As the Prime Minister said weeks still into this.
But the measures seem to be working.
We're cutting away from that to bring you to Toronto where the Ontario premier Doug ford is speaking.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Andrew Nichols picks up our coverage.
Thank you for watching.



We owe it to our most vulnerable and our families and loved ones to fight this terrible virus until the end.
We owe it to them, to leave nothing on the table and today we're throwing everything we've got at our long-term care homes and we're utilizing over available resource.
We will stop at nothing to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
Today we're lauchering an all-out plan to fight COVID-19 in our long-t
