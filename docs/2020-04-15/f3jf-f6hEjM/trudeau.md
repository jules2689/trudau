**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today, we're announcing more help for more Canadians.
This includes topping up the pay of essential workers.
At the same time, we'll also be expanding the Canada emergency response benefit to reach people two are earning some income, as well as for seasonal workers who are facing no jobs and for those who have run out of e. I. recently.
a little lather, I'll have news about where we are with testing.
 in parliament, you heard me talk about the contributions of the largest generation.
People who grew up and fought in world war ii. Right across the country, the last members of this generation are now living in seniors' homes and long-term care facilities.
The truth is tragic and worrisome.
These are the places we look after our seniors and yet they are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. This is something that I want to address with the premiers during a discussion tomorrow evening.
We must all do better.
We must show leadership to support those seniors who built this country.
To begin with, our government will be working with the provinces and territories to increase the pay of our essential workers earning less than $2500 a month and the same applies to long-term facility workers.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

About the contributions of the greatest generation, who grew up during the depression and fought through the second world war.
Today, across the country, the last members of this generation live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The uncomfortable and tragic truth is that the very places that care for our elderly are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. I'll be addressing this with premiers tomorrow night.
We all need to do better.
We all need to take leadership for the seniors who have built this country.
Our government will work with the provinces and territories to boost wages for essential workers who are making under $2500 a month.
Like those in our long-term care facilities.
For many workers looking after the most vulnerable Canadians, including seniors and those with disabilities, we know conditions have gotten more difficult over the past weeks.
and you need support right now.
Tomorrow, in our weekly meeting, I will discuss with provincial and territorial leaders the importance of getting this wage boost in place as quickly as possible.
As we face an unprecedented threat to public health, you are our most important line of defense.
We will do whatever we can to help you do your job and support you through this time.



**Interpreter**:

Introduced the Canada emergency response benefit.
This is part of a plan that we put in place to ensure that everyone can receive the necessary help to come through this difficult period.
Millions of Canadians have already received the benefit.
But we know that many other people were not eligible and yet still need help.
Today, we will be relaxing the criteria to allow even more Canadians to benefit from are it. If you earn $1, 000 a month or less, you can now receive the Canada emergency response benefit because many people do not work as many hours as before and others must adjust to the reality of contract or gig work.
Workers who have run out of e. I. benefits recently will also be able to receive the benefit.
and across the country, many people will not have any seasonal work this year because of the pandemic.
Therefore, the CERB will also be available to them.
This is a difficult context as well for creators and artists right across the country.
Cultural venues are closed and work is rare.
Minister guilbeault has asked for artists asking for copyright before the crisis happened not make them ineligible for the CERB and, therefore, as these anxious times, artists continue to help us reflect on life and dream.
They bring sunshine into our lives and we're grateful for that.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today I can announce that we're expanding the CERB to include people making up to $1, 000 a month, seasonal worker and people whose e. I. has recently run out.
Maybe you're a volunteer firefighter or a contractor who can pick up some shifts or you have a part-time jock ---job in the grocery store.
Even if you're still working or want to start working again.
You probably need help in making ends meet.
If you earn $1, 000 or less a month, you'll now be able to apply for the CERB.
If you were expecting a seasonal job that isn't coming because of COVID-19, you will now be able to apply.
and if you have run out of e. I. since January 1, you can now apply for the CERB as well.
For others who still need help, including post-secondary students and businesses worried about commercial rent, we'll have more to say soon.
No matter who you are or where you live, we're in your corner.




**Interpreter**:

After accepting an initial request from Nunavut, Quebec sent us a request for the north shore and I can confirm that the Canadian rangers will be there to lend a hand.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The government of Quebec has sent us a second request for  I can confirm that the Canadian rangers will be there to provide support.
I want to thank our women and men in uniform and the families who serve alongside them for all that they do. Whenever we need you most, you're always there for us. 



**Interpreter**:

From time to time, we may feel overwhelmed by events.
We're in a situation that may seem unreal and it's not always easy to deal with everything happening around us. This week, the government is launching a new portal that will bring together mental health resources and will make them available to Canadians.
You can go to Canada.
Ca or use the application Canada COVID-19 to talk to someone.
There is no reason to feel embarrassed about that.
The important thing is to get the help you need.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

If you are feeling overwhelmed, know that you aren't alone.
and there are people who can help.
We have launched a mental health portal at Canada.
Ca and through the Canada COVID-19 app where you can go to find support.
So if you need to, please reach out.
We'll be there for each other.
Finally, we have more news today to share on testing.
Lumen ultra from New Brunswick with whom we signed a contract is now ramping up production to supply enough COVID-19 test chemicals to meet the weekly demand in all provinces.
and in the last few days, we received a new batch of swabs to make sure every province has the supplies they need to keep testing.
Whether it's reagents or test kits, we are ensuring that Canada has the tools to fight this virus.
Tomorrow, I'll also be speaking with the other g-7 leaders about continuing to coordinate a strong and effective global response to this pandemic.




**Interpreter**:

The business lumen ultra new Brunswick's ramping up its production capacity in order to provide enough chemicals for COVID-19 test kits.
and tests that need to be conducted in the provinces and territories.
Up until now, we have also received a new batch of swabs.
I know that everyone wants to know when life will go back to normal.
But the reality is that we cannot give you a specific date.
But this is what we know.
For this to be over, people have to stay home.
We have to limit our movements as much as possible and keep a distance of two meters from others.
and if everyone does his or her part, we will come through this together.
Thank you.
