**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today, we're announcing more help for more Canadians.
This includes topping up the pay of essential workers.
At the same time, we'll also be expanding the Canada emergency response benefit to reach people two are earning some income, as well as for seasonal workers who are facing no jobs and for those who have run out of e. I. recently.
a little lather, I'll have news about where we are with testing.
 in parliament, you heard me talk about the contributions of the largest generation.
People who grew up and fought in world war ii. Right across the country, the last members of this generation are now living in seniors' homes and long-term care facilities.
The truth is tragic and worrisome.
These are the places we look after our seniors and yet they are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. This is something that I want to address with the premiers during a discussion tomorrow evening.
We must all do better.
We must show leadership to support those seniors who built this country.
To begin with, our government will be working with the provinces and territories to increase the pay of our essential workers earning less than $2500 a month and the same applies to long-term facility workers.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

About the contributions of the greatest generation, who grew up during the depression and fought through the second world war.
Today, across the country, the last members of this generation live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The uncomfortable and tragic truth is that the very places that care for our elderly are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. I'll be addressing this with premiers tomorrow night.
We all need to do better.
We all need to take leadership for the seniors who have built this country.
Our government will work with the provinces and territories to boost wages for essential workers who are making under $2500 a month.
Like those in our long-term care facilities.
For many workers looking after the most vulnerable Canadians, including seniors and those with disabilities, we know conditions have gotten more difficult over the past weeks.
and you need support right now.
Tomorrow, in our weekly meeting, I will discuss with provincial and territorial leaders the importance of getting this wage boost in place as quickly as possible.
As we face an unprecedented threat to public health, you are our most important line of defense.
We will do whatever we can to help you do your job and support you through this time.



**Interpreter**:

Introduced the Canada emergency response benefit.
This is part of a plan that we put in place to ensure that everyone can receive the necessary help to come through this difficult period.
Millions of Canadians have already received the benefit.
But we know that many other people were not eligible and yet still need help.
Today, we will be relaxing the criteria to allow even more Canadians to benefit from are it. If you earn $1, 000 a month or less, you can now receive the Canada emergency response benefit because many people do not work as many hours as before and others must adjust to the reality of contract or gig work.
Workers who have run out of e. I. benefits recently will also be able to receive the benefit.
and across the country, many people will not have any seasonal work this year because of the pandemic.
Therefore, the CERB will also be available to them.
This is a difficult context as well for creators and artists right across the country.
Cultural venues are closed and work is rare.
Minister guilbeault has asked for artists asking for copyright before the crisis happened not make them ineligible for the CERB and, therefore, as these anxious times, artists continue to help us reflect on life and dream.
They bring sunshine into our lives and we're grateful for that.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today I can announce that we're expanding the CERB to include people making up to $1, 000 a month, seasonal worker and people whose e. I. has recently run out.
Maybe you're a volunteer firefighter or a contractor who can pick up some shifts or you have a part-time jock ---job in the grocery store.
Even if you're still working or want to start working again.
You probably need help in making ends meet.
If you earn $1, 000 or less a month, you'll now be able to apply for the CERB.
If you were expecting a seasonal job that isn't coming because of COVID-19, you will now be able to apply.
and if you have run out of e. I. since January 1, you can now apply for the CERB as well.
For others who still need help, including post-secondary students and businesses worried about commercial rent, we'll have more to say soon.
No matter who you are or where you live, we're in your corner.




**Interpreter**:

After accepting an initial request from Nunavut, Quebec sent us a request for the north shore and I can confirm that the Canadian rangers will be there to lend a hand.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The government of Quebec has sent us a second request for  I can confirm that the Canadian rangers will be there to provide support.
I want to thank our women and men in uniform and the families who serve alongside them for all that they do. Whenever we need you most, you're always there for us. 



**Interpreter**:

From time to time, we may feel overwhelmed by events.
We're in a situation that may seem unreal and it's not always easy to deal with everything happening around us. This week, the government is launching a new portal that will bring together mental health resources and will make them available to Canadians.
You can go to Canada.
Ca or use the application Canada COVID-19 to talk to someone.
There is no reason to feel embarrassed about that.
The important thing is to get the help you need.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

If you are feeling overwhelmed, know that you aren't alone.
and there are people who can help.
We have launched a mental health portal at Canada.
Ca and through the Canada COVID-19 app where you can go to find support.
So if you need to, please reach out.
We'll be there for each other.
Finally, we have more news today to share on testing.
Lumen ultra from New Brunswick with whom we signed a contract is now ramping up production to supply enough COVID-19 test chemicals to meet the weekly demand in all provinces.
and in the last few days, we received a new batch of swabs to make sure every province has the supplies they need to keep testing.
Whether it's reagents or test kits, we are ensuring that Canada has the tools to fight this virus.
Tomorrow, I'll also be speaking with the other g-7 leaders about continuing to coordinate a strong and effective global response to this pandemic.




**Interpreter**:

The business lumen ultra new Brunswick's ramping up its production capacity in order to provide enough chemicals for COVID-19 test kits.
and tests that need to be conducted in the provinces and territories.
Up until now, we have also received a new batch of swabs.
I know that everyone wants to know when life will go back to normal.
But the reality is that we cannot give you a specific date.
But this is what we know.
For this to be over, people have to stay home.
We have to limit our movements as much as possible and keep a distance of two meters from others.
and if everyone does his or her part, we will come through this together.
Thank you.



**THANK YOU, PRIME MINISTER. WE'LL NOW GO TO THE PHONE FOR QUESTIONS. ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW-UP. OPERATOR? OPERATOR**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Interpreter**:

I'd like to hear you comment on the discussions with Quebec with respect to the intervention of the Canadian armed forces in long-term care facilities.
We're told that people from the medical division may not be enough so are the troops or is the c. a.f. Ready to intervene? those discussions continue with Quebec and the other provinces to see how we can help even more.
We have developed a portal where people of experience -- with medical experience or special experience can provide their help and we shared that portal with all the provinces.
We continued to work directly with Quebec on their requests for more resources and we will continue to work with Quebec on that.
a follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Yes, you're not really answering the question.
I understand you're work on this, but are there discussions? Quebec said yesterday we need people on the ground now.
Why nothing being done right now and other than medical personnel, can you send in military personnel to serve meals, pick up garbage? what exactly can you do immediately?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Interpreter**:

Well, immediately, right now, we are working with Quebec as to how we can help.
We know that there are needs out there in Quebec and right across the country.
and that is why we're working with the provinces to provide them, wherever possible, the resources that they require.
We are there to be their partners.
We are there to pursue these discussions and bring in help as quickly as possible if it is necessary.



**OPERATOR? OPERATOR**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like you to comment on the decision by the United States to freeze its funding for the world health organization.
My priority and the priority of our government right now is to do everything twoek protect -- we can to protect Canadians and ensure the health and safety of people across the country and that means working with experts here in Canada and around the world and we will continue to do that important work for Canadians.



Prime Minister Trudeau's one of the things that is so important for Canada to do is to continue to work with local experts and international experts to do everything we can to night virus and keep Canadians safe and protected.
That is what we'll continue to do.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

That's fine.
But are you not concerned that this will have consequences for the global fight against COVID-19? well, tomorrow I will have an opportunity to speak to other g-7 leaders to talk about how we can properly continue to work together.
To fight COVID-19. and, of course, coordinate our approach based on science and evidence and working with experts around the world.



Thank you.
Merci.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Obviously I've been asking you for about a month now about Canada's prisons.
You promised repeatedly that new measures would be coming and that the Minister of public safety would be announcing new cooperation with the parole board.
We still haven't seen any of that.
is this just not a priority? is nothing coming? is there going to be a decision about being released on day passes? is there any announcement coming?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have made significant efforts and taken significant steps to ensure that our incarcerated population is kept as safe as possible from COVID-19. There are a number of measures that we've taken.
We continue to look at more measures, we're coordinating with the province on these efforts as well.
We know that this is a scenario where we've seen challenges in terms of outbreaks, but we also are continuing to step up our efforts every day to ensure that all Canadians are protected.



**Reporter**:

So you say you ear sting up your efforts.
The directive from the commissioner last week said that corrections officers should wear face masks.
That corrections Canada has previously said they're providing soap and hand sanitizer.
By all accounts, those things aren't happening.
So if the work you're doing isn't happening, do you need to change tacks.
and finally, have you totally abandoned the idea of releasing federal inmates?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There have been a number of discussions at the highest levels about various processes that need to be put in place.
There have been reductions in transfers and, you know, issues that have put potentially people who work there and people who are incarcerated there more at risk.
We have taken a number of measures.
We will continue to look at taking more measures and we will ensure that the measures in place are properly followed.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

We recognized that it's important to ensure that we protect people who work in our federal institutions as well as inmates.
and that is why we have taken specific measures and we are continuing to monitor the situation to see that they're followed.
Of course, we will seek other ways to ensure the protection of those people.



**MERCI. ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE PHONE. OPERATOR? OPERATOR**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, Canadian press, please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Social distancing advice differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, from Vancouver closing Stanley park to cars and people walking around it to ottawa's local experts telling people to basically not chat on their driveway with neighbors.
In light of this, how do you sustain public confidence in social distancing measures?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think we've been very, very clear that the best way to prevent further spread of COVID-19 is to stay home as much as possible.
If you have to go out, go out infrequently and keep two meter's distance from each other and wash your hands aggressively and often.
These are the things we're asking all Canadians to do. Across the country, we recognize that different communities are in different situations, that there are different local health experts giving advice that is suitable to that particular context.
We make sure that everyone is getting the message that we all have to do our part to fight COVID-19 and that means engaging in social distancing.
But it is perfectly normal that there be slight variances in approaches in a pandemic that is manifesting itself in very different ways in different parts of the country.




**Interpreter**:

We have been saying how important it is to take actions in order to protect yourself and to ensure that COVID-19 will not spread further.
That means staying home as much as possible, not going out unless it's absolutely necessary and also keeping a two-meter distance from others if you must.
and regularly and aggressively washing your hands.
Of course, in various regions of the country, there are different situations as regards to pandemics.
So, there are variations and expert recommendations.
But the major recommendation remains.
We must do everything we can to keep practicing physical distancing and prevent further spread of COVID-19.



**Reporter**:

On the world health organization, how much total financial support is Canada now providing to the organization? and has the United States president ever put any pressure on Canada to either boost or, of late, reduce its support for the organization?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Canada's support for the world health organization is in the tens of millions of dollars.
I think we can make sure that someone has the exact numbers for you or for the media.
and, no, the president has made any direct or indirect asks of Canada around that.



FranÇois?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

I believe our support for the W.H.O. is in the order of $10 million per year.
I know we recently increased our contribution as a result of the pandemic.
But I will be sure that you have a specific answer to that in the coming hours.
and, no, the president has not asked Canada to do anything with respect to funding for the W.H.O.



**Reporter**:

Glen mcgregor, CTV news.
You've repeatedly said how much Canada has relied on the W.H.O. For what's. Haing around the world.
Are you satisfied the organization sufficiently interrogated the information coming out of china in the early days of the pan democrat -- pandemic? a lot of the information was false or misleading, especially human-to-human transmission.
Do you think they did a good job on how they handled that information and shared wit other countries?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think what we need to remember is the path through this pandemic is for us to base ourselves on science, on the recommendations of experts, on data and the knowledge that we've gathered from past pandemics and past health issues to apply to these situations.
and that is why we will always continue to work with experts, both domestically and internationally, to take the best advice possible in keeping Canadians safe.
Of course, in the coming months and years, there will be many reflections on various institutions and systems both domestically and internationally on how we can improve our response and how we can learn from things we could have done better in this process.
These are things that will come in the coming times.
Right now our focus needs to be on doing the best we can right now to protect Canadians.



We are hearing about potential shortages of medication used for pain killing and sedation before patients are intimated and put on ventilators.
What is happening at the federal level to ensure that there is a continued supply of those medications?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Public health Canada and procurement Canada are working together to ensure the steady supply of essential medications to Canada, both related to COVID-19 and not.
We recognize that this is a global health crisis.
So, there are challenges, but Canada has a very strong pharmaceutical industry.
We have very strong relationships around the world.
On getting medication and necessary supplies.
We will continue to do everything we can to ensure that Canadians get what they need.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

Our teams and our departments are working with the provinces and our partners around the world to ensure that there will be the proper availability of medications and essential goods and we will always do whatever we need to do to ensure that Canadians have the products and medications they need.
We know that we're in a global crisis at this time.
But Canada will always have the equipment it needs for Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Tom Perry with CBC news.
The conservatives and others have raised concerns that the W.H.O. Was too willing to take the word of the chinese regime early on in the pandemic.
Do you share those concerns?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there is obviously reflections that we have to have going forward and we have to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep Canadians safe.
and that is our focus right now.
What can we do now? what do we need to do in the coming weeks? how do we lean on experts in international institutions and in partner countries around the world.
We're making recommendations alongside our domestic experts on what we need to do now.
There will be plenty of time as we move forward to reflect on challenges that were faced in the past.
We need to learn and move forward as quickly as we can.



**Reporter**:

You said yesterday that you're talking to the provinces and territories about eventually re-opening the economy.
Can you say what work specifically you're doing with the provinces and territoris to do this? and you also said there are different points along the spectrum of the pandemic.
Do you see when things do start returning to normal, is that on a provincial level, local level, national level? how is it going to work?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we recognize that this pandemic is going through very different phases and different points across the country.
One-size-fits-all will not work for our country as diverse as Canada.
But the overarching principles are extremely important.
We know, regardless of where you are in the country, we need to get through this first wave before we can start releasing some of the rules around social distancing and staying at home.
How that release works will vary from region to region, from industry to industry and coordination at the federal level and how we do that is going to be very important.
But with spring coming, people are looking outside and wanting to get out, wanting this to be over.
I understand that.
It will be weeks more before we can seriously consider loosening the restrictions.
It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out that we're suddenly back in another big wave of COVID-19. and have -- and everything we've gone through up to now would have been for nothing because we'll find ourselves once again in the same situation.
If we hold on through this period now, as long as we have to, once we are able to release things, we will be able to better control how things move forward.
But as imparent -- impatient as people are getting across the country, we need to continue to hold on. If what we're doing now as sacrifices are going to be worth it. 



**Interpreter**:

I recognize that people want to know when this is going to be over.
and when we can relax the rules on social distancing and kick start our economy again.
The reality is that if we start to relax those restrictions too quickly, we may very soon find ourselves in the same situation as now or even worse with a new wave coming almost immediately.
and in that case, everything we will have done and what we're doing now will have been for naught.
Now people are making sacrifices right now.
They're going through very difficult times.
and we're going to have to don't do that for a number of weeks yet.
In order to be ready to properly manage and be vigilant as we gradually come out of this.
Yes, we'll have to coordinate that with the provinces, but we will especially have to remain in this phase for a while yet.
To ensure that when we can relax the restrictions, we will not end up in the same situation a few months later.



**Reporter**:

I know you've spoken about a coordinated effort and more patience is needed in terms of re-opening the economy.
But just a follow-up on that.
I'm wondering whether you envision, when that happens, that workers will be tested before they have returned to work.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Obviously when we are able to loosen the controls on social distancing and start to re-open our economy, massive, rapid testing on a very wide scale basis will be an essential part of the vigilance we have to have.
There will also be a need for very aggressive contact tracing whenever there is a case that appears.
We have to be extremely quick about responding to any future outbreaks in future waves.
But in order to get to that point, we need to continue doing what we are doing now.
For many more weeks.
We cannot be in a rush to get things going again because f we move too quickly to loosen all of controls, everything we're doing now might have been for nothing.
We'll find ourselfs in another peak just as bad as this one or worse.
and it will be extremely damaging, both to how Canadians feel, but also to our economy.
That is why we are going to be extremely careful about any steps towards re-opening the economy.
It seems like over the past days, people are talk -- oh, we'll re-open this, do that, re-open that.
It's not happening yet.
If we re-open too soon, everything we're doing right now might be for nothing.
We are making sacrifices.
We're there for each other.
We need to hold on. Still.
and then, once we're ready, once the pertss are telling us that we can talk about re-opening the economy a little bit we will take careful steps and do that.




**Interpreter**:

I realize for a number of days people have been talk about re-opening the economy again and getting back to work and being able to go outside.
and obviously with spring here, people are anxious to do that.
But I have to tell you, we're not at that stage yet.
We're far from that stage.
If we re-open things too quickly, we could very easily find ourselves in an even worse situation than right now.
and all we will have done and everything we've been doing for the last few weeks will have been for nothing and we have to start all over again.
We do not want that to happen.
So please be patient.
Please continue to show the kind of discipline we've seen in new Canadians.
Let's continue to protect our health care workers and do everything we can to protect our seniors.
and we will get through this.
But we have to stay the course.



Prime Minister, as we see the horrific stories unfold each day across the country, with regards to long-term care facilities, people getting sick, people being abandoned, many dying, if your mom was in one of these facilities, what would you do?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I can't imagine what so many Canadians are going through right now.
With loved ones who are suffering.
People they can't even visit right now.
Seniors worried about falling ill and not being able to see their kids and grand kids again.
These are the things that we need to focus on as a country.
That is what I will be speaking with premiers about tomorrow night.
How the federal government can support the premiers and their responsibility and their jurisdiction over long-term care facilities and senior care.
To make sure that we are supporting the heroes who are working in extraordinarily difficult situations for very low pay, to continue that work safely and mostly to keep our elders safe.
This is a situation where, as a society, as a country, we need to pull together, to be there for our elders who built this country.
That is what we're going to focus on in the coming days.




**Interpreter**:

We recognize that it's absolutely essential to be there for our seniors and to be there as well for people who are receiving only very modest salaries in order to help our seniors.
We must continue to be there for them and that is what I will be addressing with the premiers tomorrow to see how we can support the people working with our seniors and a elderly and also ensure that they remain healthy and safe.
They are going through very difficult times.
They are anxious, they're afraid and they are uncertain as to whether they're going to be able to see their children or grandchildren.
and as a society, we have to do better for them.
Radio-Canada.
Now with respect to the long-term care facilities, the army could possibly help out.
Now do you want to send in only medical personnel or are you thinking about sending in other people who are now part of the c. a.f. To help out the personnel there who are totally overwhelmed? we are currently if discussions with Quebec and the other provinces to see how we can provide them with more resources.
As I said, we received two specific requests from Quebec to send in the c. a.f. To nunavik and the lower north shore and work with the province answer respond to any request that is made with respect to anything.
We are there to help and work with the provinces as they see fit.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There have been two requests so far by request ebb to send in support from the Canadian armed forces in both nunavik in northern Quebec and the shoreline.
As any more requests come in, we'll look to support Quebec or other provinces asking for help from the federal government regardless of what that help looks like and what they're asking us. We will be there to help out as provinces need help.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

You're saying we have to continue to do what we're doing to stop the pandemic.
But right now we're trying to stop the spread.
But until there is collective immunization or a vaccine, and it will take a long time before we get a vaccine, are there scenarios your government is looking at in terms of collective immunization and this would be for certain sectors to be able to start up and perhaps protect certain groups? well, our priority is to avoid seeing our health care system overwhelmed.
and a mortality rate going from 2% to 3% to 10% as we saw in other countries.
That is absolutely what we want to avoid.
So, yes.
We are slowing the spread of the virus and we're also developing methods and technical capacities in terms of testing and the ability to do quick contact tracing so that we know who may have been infected at one point or another.
and we are developing these tools in order to be extremely vigilant.
Once we've come through this first wave of COVID-19. So that we can perhaps relax some of the restrictions on citizens and on the economy.
But at the same time, we know that as long as there is no vaccine, we will have to continue to be extremely vigilant and to respond very quickly.
If there is a resurgence of COVID-19. and if -- and it is all of those reflections that are ongoing at this point.
As I said, we will need to remain in this sphere of severe restrictions in order to have that ability and the able to look at the next steps.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that, until there is a vaccine for COVID-19, we are going to have to remain extremely vigilant as a world, as a country, to resurgences, even once this first wave is through.
We will be able to look very carefully at how, with extraordinary vigilance and very rapid response times to any future resurgences of the virus, we can carefully reengage in certain sectors of our economy in loosening up the restrictions.
We are not there yet.
We have to be through this first wave sufficiently to be able to know that we have the capacity to stamp out and restrict any future outbreaks as they come along.
That means technology, that means better testing capacity and continued vigilance, not just by governments but by all Canadians to preventing it. We're still a number of -- a number of weeks away from that.
But we are reflecting on what that looks like and what sort of technology and medical solutions will be necessary.
We will get through this together.
For now, we need to stay strong in our social distancing measures afternoon by staying at home.
Merci.beaucoup.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister of Canada.
Lots of news about what he had to say there today.
Let me point to two pieces on what to keep our eye on tomorrow.
a call to g-7 leader where is the issue of W.H.O. and funding will come up and also a call scheduled with premiers who he's been speaking to on a weekly basis where the issue of long-term care centers is supposed to be addressed to. Let me go to My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
There are significant changes that brought in things far lot of Canadians who had felt kind of hopeless, frankly, and left out.
Lots more will be included now.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
This is definitely a significant announcement and one that the Prime Minister signaled was coming.
The opposition, both opposition parties, but primarily the n. D.p. Have really pushed this issue.
So, the idea of people who were not yet covered by the CERB and specifically what the Prime Minister announced today was those, for example, who earned less than $1, 000 a month.
They will now be able to apply.
That is really ah lot of people, for example, who have seen their income cut.
It was a prerequisite prior to today for accessing the CERB.
In addition, seasonal workers.
We heard a lot from those who don't anticipate that they will be able to access that work and access the CERB.
Also if your e. I. benefits have dissipated, if you no longer have them, you can act access it as well.
and the final point about the call with the premiers.
Long-term care homes.
We have seen some provinces move to top up the pay of people who work in those homes.
The Prime Minister had previously signaled he was looking at a national approach to that.
and there would be some discussion with the premiers around that.
I don't know how specifically that would work or the degree to which the top-up would happen.
I think he had specifics around how much people were making.
I think it was less than $2500 a month.
Yeah.
I think so. So we'll look to see exactly what that means.
But you can see that the focus we've seen from provinces, it is provincial jurisdiction on the issue and what we're seeing on the spread of COVID-19 within these long-term care homes now going to be a primary point of discussion between the premiers and the Prime Minister and I'm curious to see what more the federal government can do. They put out some guidelines but they are guidelines because of provincial jurisdiction.
Are there any moves behind the scenes to up the federal oversight of what's happening in long-term care homes because we know from your discussion from your last guest it is a pretty serious situation across the country.



**Rosemary**:

and it is very unfortunate that it took this pan democrat ticket bring attention to something that clearly has been a pr or for quite some time.
David Cochrane reporting that nine out of 626 Ontario nursing homes received inspections last year.
Almost none of them, frankly.
David Cochrane, maybe get you to go on the W.H.O. There, the Prime Minister was asked about trump suspending his funding to the W.H.O.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Canada won't change its approach based on what the United States has done and the United States has put no pressure on Canada to change its approach.
I want to tip it back to the CERB and the top-up for essential workers.
$2500 a month.
That is $30, 000 a year for an essential worker.
Think about the economics of that.
and what that actually tells us about what's happening in long-term care homes.
This was discussed last week where the Prime Minister said last Thursday that this is something that they -- he wanted to look at and needed to find a way.
I think the urgency of what has unfolded since last Thursday and today has certainly heightened the need to get cash into the system to make sure that more workers aren't compeled to leave and they can entice other people to go in. On the CERB and the expansion of that, they're making it as universal as possible without making it completely universal.
The urgency on getting that done comes from the numbers we saw from the bank of Canada today.
They kept their rate at .25%. but they said economic activity went down, but it will go down 15% to 30% in the next quarter.
Between April and June.
They're expecting a drop of up to 30% in economic activity.
That is why expanding CERB criteria so important.
Seasonal workers, I know in atlantic Canada, the fishery, worried about being able to physically distance.
They may not open because of this.
This is why this is so needed.



**Rosemary**:

and stat scan saying the g. D.p. Dropped by 9%, just in March.
Thank you both very much.
I have to leave you and come back for our federal press conference at the top of the hour.
The Prime Minister broadly expanding that emergency relief benefit so if you had questions whether you qualify, check out online because you might now.
I'm rosemary barton.
You can watch our ongoing coverage at cbc news network and cbc.
Ca. See you tomorrow.
[please stand by]students and businesses who needhelp, there will be more information for them in the coming days, too.
I want to turn our attention to a more uplifting story as we wait for the federal officials, cabinet ministers and public health officials to come up and give us a briefing, probably more details on the CERB and ongoing questions on the W.H.O. Let me bring in the owner and chef at two restaurants in ottawa.
and he's in his kitchen making he hungry and he's been using his expertise to make meals for people in the city, for sheltersi believe, but also essential workers.
Good to see you.



Hi, rosemary, how are you?



**Rosemary**:

Thanks for making the time.
Tell me what you're doing?



Yeah, during this pandemic what we did is just giving meals.
We did 600 meals last week, pretty much every day.
and now it's bumped up to 900 meals every day.
Because the restaurant is closed at the moment and the food is going to different shelters and residents where the people not have a hot meal.
So that is what we're trying to do. Every day the menu changes.
I get a lot of help from different chefs around the city and they come and cook together as a family here.



**Rosemary**:

That's incredible.
That's incredible.
So how are you -- your restaurant shut down.
I know you have takeout and delivery, but how are you affording this? how can you do this at a time when you're not making any money?



Yeah, we're getting donation and the chefs are working and we make the deals with the producers, like Cisco is a good help for us. They gave us a lot of supplies.
So we're cooking together.
The good meal, but the real lessexpensive, but a good hot meal.
Who doesn't want that good meal like that? you know?



**Rosemary**:

You're bringing it to homeless shelters, residences?



Yeah, different residences.
Some of the people who sheltered in different places.
You know, families.
Kids who don't have cooking, don't have a kitchen.
So they're not supposed to get ahoy meal every day, so that is what we're providing at the moment.



**Rosemary**:

and, Joe, I know a lot of people in Ottawa know you and your restaurants and know what you're like, but explain tocanadians why you're doing this.
Why you felt the need to do it.



Because I am blessed to be incanada and running it 16 years, a prospering business.
You know, I am blessed.
I serve the most prestigious people.
I think this is the time we should help the needy people.
and we are here and only thing know is how to cook good food.
So why not give a meal when somebody is hungry, that is the gift you can give, that is karma to do. So that is what I'm trying to do without any -- not much expense, you know.
That is what I'm doing.



**Rosemary**:

Do you think your restaurants will be open when this all over? do you think you'll be able to reopen?



Yeah, yeah.
We're in good standing because we were here 16 years and the community supported us and this is the time to go back.
and I'm thankful that the canadagovernment is doing a lot of good things even for business, the employees and all that.
So once this is over, we will come back and serve the same thing, no problem.
No worries.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to leave it there.
I appreciate speaking with you.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Happy lunch [laughter].



Thank you [laughter].



**Rosemary**:

Wanted to make sure, it is good to take a breather once in a while and reach out and show someone doing something extraordinary in these difficult times.
That's the case for Joe.
As we stand by and wait for the briefing from cabinet ministers and public health, I want to go back to the issue of the world health organization and funding after Donald trump yesterday announced that he would be suspending his funding as largest donor to the W.H.O. Concerns around how china and the W.H.O. Were interacting.
My producer did get the number that justin trudeau did not have, which is how much Canada contributes to the W.H.O. It is about $71 million canadianannually.
HT is the 17th biggest donor just after china actually to theW.H.O. I want to bring in Vassy kapeloson this point.
While he was asked directly about this, the answer was diplomatic to say the least, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I think this is an interesting subject that obviously follows as you mentioned on what the president of the United States announced yesterday, the withholding of funds, of American funds, for the W.H.O. He also, the Prime Minister mentioned, he didn't have the exact figure, but he said they thought they recently increased their contribution due to the pandemic.
So it will be interesting if it's in addition.
He said there was no pressure inthe United States, from president trump to follow suit, but when he was asked specifically -- and he has received this question before, ithink about 10 days or a week ago -- on whether he trusts the data? whether the government here should be trusting the data coming out of china, he didn't specifically address the question.
He talked about the importance of science and the importance ofworking together with other leaders.
He mentioned the g7 call that will take place tomorrow.
But he didn't say one way or theother if the data coming out of china is reliable.
He did echo what he said in the past that those questions could be asked and should be asked andthey probably will be asked, buthe didn't provide sort of a canadian position on the validity of the data coming out of china and whether or not he has specific concerns about whatappears to be a heavy reliance from the W.H.O. Or at least that's how it's characterized bysome like president trump on thedata coming out of china.
The other thing I would bring up, this looks ahead to the press conference, I believe the health Minister patty hajdu willbe there.
I remember on the first day thatthe Prime Minister got questionson this, she received them on the briefing.
Her comments stuck out for me, because specifically she said there is no indication that the data that came out of china in terms of the infection rate and death rate was falsified.
When she received a follow-up, she accused the reporter of feeding into conspiracy theories.
I'm curious to see if her position has changed in light ofthe information that has come out in the past 10 days or sincethose comments were made.
and in light also of the pivot in conversation around the world.
I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that's it's not like people are supportive of the decision to withhold cho W.H.O. Funding.
There has been a lot of criticism of withholding funding, but that doesn't mean people aren't asking questions about china, how they're handledthis, and the lack of transparency there and the W.H.O.'s reliance on the information.



**Rosemary**:

Part of the problem for the W.H.O. is it is only as good as the data that it is getting from countries that haveoutbreaks.
and so it is making decisions based on that information, whichwe now know as david talked about earlier, according to the associated press, was not accurate.
There were, at least if you believe the reports, there was an attempt to withhold information for a period of six days within china.
No one would believe that china is the most transparent country when it comes to information of any kind.
I guess the question people should have and would have rightnow is how reliant or how -- howshould the W.H.O. Operate knowing that fact? knowing that china does not havethe same kind of disclosure and transparency that other countries have? and I'm glad you brought up the patty hajdu situation.
That question, because she was heavily criticized for suggesting that china had been truthful and honest with all of its reporting, but, david, bringyou in here.
It sort of goes to what you weresaying earlier.
This is a very delicate dance and one that Canada finds itselfin with china time after time, whether it's with the Canadians held in prison without charges right now, all these things, we have to manage in terms of how much we need china versus what their impact is in other situations around the world.



**Reporter**:

It's a very delicate geopolitical dance at time of global crisis.
Even when dealing with Michael savor and Michael kovrig cases, and the detentions apparently inretaliation, obviously in retaliation for the detention ofmeng Lanzhou in the huawei extradition case in the United States.
It's key to point out that it's not just people like Jason Kenny or Donald trump and people on the right side of the political spectrum, the conservative side of the spectrum that are cite criticizing.
Irwin cutler wrote a blistering op-ed basically talking about how china's secrecy and the ruleof president xi, the clampdown op the information has allowed the pandemic to accelerate in a way it might not have -- becausenothing is certain when you're dealing with pandemics -- had disclosure happened earlier.
This is where it started and there are clear signs now and ample reporting that there was acoverup of some sort.
and the challenge, though, remains that in the here and nowof today in dealing with this ina country that has not yet hit its peak and a crisis in long-term care homes, Canada does not yet have a consistent and robust enough domestic supply of personal protective equipment.
It needs china.
It needs factories, it needs equipment and those shipments.
While trump can do what trump does because it's the United States and it plays by an entirely different set of rules than Canada can ever hope to play by, there is a diplomacy required here because the planesthat are going into china need permission to land there and thefactories they need to negotiateor pie with them, or the -- buy with them, or the P.P.E., that can Dr. up quickly if the chinese government doesn't like what we say and plays hardball.



**Rosemary**:

I see it on the side of the screen, but let me say it, because the head of the W.H.O. Did have a virtual press conference today and said he regretted the United States president's decision to pull funding.
Called on the world for unity tofight the pandemic.
He said the W.H.O. is assessing the impact and will try to fill gaps with partners.
Again, it's a suspension of money for now, but it could be apermanent decision if the United States administration decides this is not where they want their money to go. There are indications that the W.H.O. is not doing what they want it to do. The Prime Minister saying this will come up in a g7 call tomorrow, with president trump on that call.
Do want to bring in one more guest.
International relief organization, doctors without borders, is taking action that has never taken before.
It is launching an operation inside Canada, inside this country, and the group's executive director joins us now.
Good MO see, you, Mr. Beliveau.
This is unprecedented.
I'm not mistaken.
What made the decision? how did you make the decision that Canada needed help inside our own borders?



Like you said, unprecedented decision.
Normally our group -- I'm sure your viewers know us as an organization that goes to anywhere in the world.
That takes us too places mriek Yemen, the camps in Bangladesh, or Sudan, so it's rare we would consider to intervene in a context where there is a highly functioning health system, where the standard of living is high, where it's peaceful.
So it's exceptional.
The reason we're breaking with tradition, it's a double reason.
The first is that even in a context like Canada where the system is developed, health care is widely available, there are still communities that are particularly at risk and people experiencing homelessness right now in Toronto and other places in Canada are one such group.
and the other reason is because now with decades of experience of outbreak response, we've accumulated a wealth of expertise and knowledge.
So our role -- normally we're out there with boots on the ground, our role here is to share that expertise with other front line actors here in Canada.



**Rosemary**:

How did it come about? was it an offer? or the city of Toronto saying we need help with the vulnerable or homeless population?



Well, it started with us scanning around Canada, looking for the people who would be mo stat risk, looking for the people who might slip through the cracks.
and that pretty quickly got us into a conversation about people experiencing homelessness and then we established a dialogue with inner city health associates.
So that's who we're collaborating with on this project together with the health authorities here in Ontario.



**Rosemary**:

and what will you be doing specifically? there is a 400-bed facility and people will be housed there and made sure they're staying healthy and doing the right thing, is that the idea?



Basically.
So it's a recovery site.
It's for people who don't have homes who test positive.
Right now is a really critical moment for this.
In the last days there has been a real uptick in the number of positive cases among toronto's 8, 000 to 10, 000 people without homes.
Critical moment to get a facility set up. As you said, we're planning for 400 beds.
To get that facility set up so they can be cared for.
Unless they're in acute phase.
They can access the hospital system then, but we want to make sure they can go somewhere to get treatment, safe, practise physical distancing and get proper care.



**Rosemary**:

Unprecedented time sand you're doing something unprecedented inside this country.
It's a really good idea, though.
Thank you for speaking with us. and good luck with it and stay healthy, thank you very much.



**Rosemary**:

Let's go to the deputy Prime Minister.
Let's listen in live.



Dr. Tam, please.



Hello, everyone.
I'll start as usual with the update on the number of COVID-19cases in Canada.
There are now 27557 cases including 954 deaths.
These numbers change throughout the day.
For the lab testing we've completed tests for over 462, 000people with about 6% confirmed positive as Canada continues to improve our testing to better track where the disease is spreading.
As Canadians continue to practise physical distancing, we're closely monitoring for signs that our efforts are having an impact on the epidemiccurve.
It's taken just over three months for the first cluster of COVID-19 cases in china to spread globally and establish a pandemic.
It is hard to take in how our life has changed in such fundamental ways over this shortperiod.
At this point we still don't have all the answers, but there is cause for cautious optimism coming from our epidemiological data.
Because COVID-19 is very contagious, even a few cases canquickly multiply resulting in a steeply rising epidemic curve.
This type of increase is referred to as exponential growth with case numbers doubling every few days.
In late March when the growth rate was the fastest, we saw case numbers doubling every three days.
In recent days we've seen a doubling time over 10 days.
This means the epidemic is slowing down.
Though we all wish this could bea sprint to the finish, it is not.
There will be marathon and no rewards for quitting early.
To use another analogy, coming down from this curve will be like making our way down a mountain in the darkness.
We must not rush.
We need to remind ourselves thisis an emerging disease and that we don't know everything, so theterrain will be uncertain.
That means we need to go slowly and be sure of our footing before taking each new step on the way down.
Along the way, we'll need to closely monitor cases and growthtrends to ensure we've got the right public health measures in place to detect the and quickly respond to any new cases or clusters.
We'll need to maintain physical distancing during this time.
Any break in our resolve could spark a new outbreak and delay our progress.
So let's maintain our collectiveresolve and crush this curve.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.



Now Dr. Njoo.
[voice of interpreter] thank you.
Hello, everyone.
I'll begin with the number of cases of COVID-19 in Canada.
There are 27, 557 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 954 deaths.
These numbers changed through the day.
As for lab testing, we've completed tests for over 452, 000people, about 6% of whom have been confirmed positive.

As Canadians continue to practise physical distancing, weare closely monitoring for signsthat our efforts are having an impact on the epidemic curve.

This type of increase is referred to as exponential growth.
This means that case numbers candouble every two or three days.
In late March when the growth rate was the fastest, we saw case numbers doubling every three days.
In recent days, however, we've observed a doubling time of about nine or ten days.
In other words, this means that the epidemic is slowing down.
Though we all wish this could bea sprint to the finish line, it is not.
This will be a marathon.
There are no rewards for quitting early.
I'd like to use another analogy.
Coming down from this epidemic curve will be like making our way down the mountain in the darkness.
We need to remind ourselves thatthis is an emerging disease.
We don't know everything which means that the terrain will be dangerous and uncertain.
That means that we need to go about this slowly and be sure of our footing before taking each new step on the way down and outalong the way.
We will need to closely monitor cases and growth trends to ensure we've got the right public health measures in place to detect and quickly respond toany new cases or clusters and toreact quickly.
We'll also need to maintain physical distancing during this time.
Any break in our resolve could spark a new outbreak and delay our progress.
So, let's maintain our collective resolve.
Let's crush in curve.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Njoo.
Patty, please?



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:

Thank you.
Hello everyone.
[voice of interpreter] today, I'd like to talk to you about mental health.
It can be difficult to maintain good mental health with all the disruptions we're currently experiencing.
It can be difficult to maintain routines.
Last week we talked about modelling.
It was a very shocking exercise for some.
We heard how the virus could continue to spread in Canada if we don't all continue to follow public health advice.
[end of translation] living through a pandemic is not easy.
Many people are struggling with fear, anxiety and loneliness.
and not being able to use our regular support networks or practise regular routines means people are struggling all acrosscanada.
and they need tools to help, including with their mental wellness and health.
As of today, all Canadians have improved access to mental healthsupports through online resourcecalled wellness together Canada.
You can check out the new suite of tools at Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
This has different tools available to meet the variety ofcanadian needs.
Whether it's anxiety, sadness orsubstance use, there is something there for you.
The options include an online peer community to talk and shareand support others.
There are also a number of self-help resources to help withanxiety, stress or other issues.
and there are options such as texting, calling or connecting by video for a session with a professional to address a specific need.
I encourage all Canadians to explore wellness together Canada, to use its resources andreach out virtually to loved ones.
Now more than ever we need to stay connected.
Thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, patty.
Now we'll hear from the minister of employment, workforce development Carla qualtrough, joining us over video link.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Hello, Bonjour.
[voice of interpreter] as I've said since the beginning, we have been committed to supporting all workers impacted by COVID-19. That is why we introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, the CERB.
[end of translation] some workers qualify and we're stepping the eligibility criteria for the benefit.
As announced by the Prime Minister this morning, we're extending the eligibility of thecerb to allow workers including the self-employed to earn up to 1, 000 a month.
Some workers exhausted their e. I. benefits and including seasonal workers who exhausted their e. I. benefits.
[voice of interpreter] these changes reflect the different realities that working Canadians are currently experiencing.
We know that people want to remain in the workforce, but have seen a dramatic loss in hours and income due to COVID-19. [end of translation] the changesannounced today will increase the number of workers we can help, including those with some income, but not enough to make ends meet.
The CERB will give them the support they need.
We know that Canadians who have been collecting e. I. do not havejobs to return to and benefits have already run out or will soon.
These people need our support and now will be eligible to the CERB.
We want to ensure our essential workers are supported during this critical time.
They're working day in and day out at hospitals, care facilities, and senior and long-term care homes, and we know the sacrifice you're makingto keep us safe.
That's why the Prime Minister announced he and Minister morneau are providing a top-up to salaries of workers making less than $2500 a month.
[voice of interpreter] we know that this is a stressful time for many.
We will continue to look for ways to ensure that we help all Canadians during this difficult time.
and I'd be happy to take your questions thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, C.R.A. [voice of interpreter] now we'll hear fromthe president of the treasury board, jean-yves Duclos.



This morning the Prime Minister made an important announcement.
The announcement puts things into perspective.
The economy has been significantly disturbed which has led the government to take unprecedented economic action and pass unprecedented measures.
We have had to strengthen our social safety net.
This is the most substantial economic action since the second world war.
and today we are expanding one part of the government's three-part economic action plan.
The Canada emergency response benefit.
So now those earning $1, 000 or less, they've heard from the Prime Minister today they will now be eligible for the CERB.
and those who have lost their income or lost most of their income, for example artists, theself-employed, freelancers, today we're helping those who are still making some income butare having difficulty making ends meet.
Their income is much, much decreased.
This can include volunteer firefighters who are also working reduced hours.
Today our announcement is very important.
All of these individuals I just listed, all of these groups willnow have access to the CERB backdated to March 15th.
and for those who were worried about juggling taking care of their health and their families, for example seasonal workers, and also those who have lost their jobs in the past few months and those who have lost their e. I., employment insurancebenefits since the first of January, they will also be eligible for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB.
Our thoughts are with essential workers in quÉbec and in Canada.
Our thoughts are with those who are caring for our seniors.
They're working in very difficult circumstances and may be earning less than $2500 a month.
Prime Minister trudeau made another announcement this morning.
He announced that we will be helping these people.
They will receive a temporary salary top-up so that they can continue to do the essential work that we need in our society, taking care of seniors and others in need of care.
Thank you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you.
We're now ready to take questions.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
We'll start with three questions over the phone line.
Operator? [end of translation]
