[voice of interpreter] the first question.
Question, hello, Minister jean-yves Duclos, I have a question about the CERB and the announcements.
Here's My first question.
What will the total bill for thecerb, how much will it cost the federal government, especially given these new expansions? and how many additional Canadians do you think will be eligible after today's announcement?



Answer.
Thank you very much for the question.
Ministers will have more answers in the upcoming days.
Here's what is essential.
We're making sure that no one falls through the cracks.
We want our social safety net to help as many people as possible.
That's why we're expanding the CERB.
QuÉbec has announced measures to help its workers in care homes and we are following suit.
Seasonal workers are also extremely important in Canada in the east, in quÉbec.
Seasonal workers at this point in time would normally have seasonal work, but that won't Bethe case this year.
We're also trying to help workers who have lost almost all of their contracts.
We're trying to help self-employed workers and those who have seen their income drastically cut.
Workers will still be able to have a few contracts all while being eligible for the CERB.



**Reporter**:

Follow-up question.
My first question was, what is the total bill that you estimatethe new CERB will cost given it's been expanded to include more workers? how much now do you estimate it will cost? how many more people do you estimate will qualify for the CERB now with the changes that you announced today? My follow-up, then, is concerning the hiking of the salaries for essential workers.
Can you clarify which essential workers you are looking at? is it just for long-term residences or is it other sectors? is it only health sector? can you clarify? and will quÉbec get money from the top-up given they've alreadystarted topping up their own essential workers.



Thank you for the questions.
First of all, with respect to --it's a little premature based on the fact that we don't know the up take of the wage subsidy.
We want employers to hire peopleback.
We want people to switch from the CERB to the wage subsidy.
So right now we're estimating while the standard eligibility criteria will indeed allow more people to access the CERB, there will be less people on the CERB once the wage subsidy is fully implemented because ultimately we want people to go back to their work, their jobs, and be connected into the labour mark etas we transition out of this.
In terms of the essential workers piece, I'll defer to the deputy Prime Minister because I know her colleague Minister morneau and herself are working on this issue.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you, C.R.A. On the top-up for essential workers, this is an effort that we are working on collaboratively with the provinces.
The Prime Minister first broached it with the premiers atthe -- on the first ministers' call on Thursday.
There was an enthusiastic response and since then I've spoken about it with a few premiers, the Prime Minister hascontinued to be working on it, and the finance Minister has been working on with his colleagues.
The Prime Minister intends to make this one of the key issues that we discussed and hopefully come to a resolution on quickly at the first ministers' call with the premiers tomorrow.
The idea this would be done collaboratively by the federal government and the provinces.
[voice of interpreter] marie, you mare right in stating that quÉbec hasalready taken action on this matter.
QuÉbec has set a great example for the federal government and for other provinces.
and quÉbec will absolutely not be penalised for being the firstprovince to act.



The next question please.
[voice of interpreter] next question.
Radio-Canada.
Question.
Hello.
There is something I'm trying tounderstand.
What about the armed forces helping in long-term care facilities? I understand that we have to wait until the provinces formally request such assistance, but what are you, the federal government, doing with the canadian armed forces? how can you help the provinces with their long-term care facilities? answer.
Minister Duclos.
The canadian armed forces can help in a whole host of ways.
Prime Minister trudeau said today that the rangers are hard at work in Canada's north.
They are helping out logistically, helping people travel and move around.
They are helping municipalities.
They are also helping out with safety and security in Canada's north which is sparsely populated but has a vast territory.
Now, as for medical assistance, as for the canadian armed forcesintervening to help medically, well, the canadian armed forces can help out substantially when it comes to health.
They would, if necessary, step into support provinces and territories, but that would have to follow, as you said, a formalrequest from quÉbec or the province.



Follow-up question.
Candidly speaking, what could they do? and if quÉbec for example requested that the army step in tomorrow, could the army then step in this week? because people are dying now.



Answer, Minister Duclos.
We must work with provinces, quÉbec and all provinces are working very hard to cope with the public health emergency that we are experiencing and the situation is particularly dire in long-term care and assisted-living facilities.
We are trying to ensure that everyone receives the help and support they need and the canadian armed forces are a support.
They are there to help and support when the provincial government, so in this case quÉbec, makes a formal request for the assistance of the canadian armed forces.
Thank you very much.



Next question.
[voice of interpreter] our next question is from tva news.
Question.
I have a question on the same topic, Minister Duclos.
Can you confirm that quÉbec has not formally requested the canadian armed forces? so is it the case that quÉbec has not specifically made a request?



Answer.
Minister Duclos.
Yes.
That is accurate.
Now talks are under way between the quÉbec government and the federal government.
and these discussions could potentially lead to a formal request.
We will always listen to the needs and requests of the quÉbecgovernment.
If quÉbec requests assistance from the Canadian armed forces or from the medical corps of thecanadian armed forces, then that will be possible.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

[voice of interpreter] I would like to restate that we have not received such a requestfrom the government of quÉbec.



**Announcer**:

Follow-up question.
This question is from Dr. Njoo.
We know that science is constantly evolving when it comes to wearing a mask.
Where are we now, what is our stance now on wearing masks? especially for the general public.
In the upcoming weeks will health Canada require that Canadians wear masks when they leave their homes?



Answer.
Dr. Njoo.
Thank you for this question.
This is a live issue, a dynamic issue.
It's constantly evolving.
Dr. Tam and I a few days ago Hadar very good conversation with the other members of Canada's special advisory committee on COVID-19. When it comes to non medical masks for the general public, we have to in fact distinguish between non medical masks and medical masks.
Medical masks are essential P.P.E. For health care workers.
As for the general public, our stance is that wearing a mask isfine.
We have advised that Canadians only leave their homes when it'sabsolutely necessary to do so. and when Canadians go somewhere where it is not possible to practise physical distancing, for example on public transit orthe grocery store, then wearing a mask is a good option, yes.
But when we wear nonmedical masks, we're protecting others.
When we wear nonmedical masks inpublic, it is because that is anaction that we can take to protect others.
However, these nonmed masks do not protect us from others, so our stance has not changed in that sense.



Julie van dusen, CBC us. Dr. Tam, when you said the epidemic is slowing down, My ears perked up, but is there any reason to get optimistic about this when it doesn't sound like there can be any change in behaviour?



Yeah, I think cautious optimism.
I think what we're doing is working.
You're seeing that slowdown, bu ti didn't say we reached the peak.
I've always said on the other side of the peak you have to be really vigilant.
If you do not, then you experience a resurgence.
We have many challenges still to deal with, including managing the outbreaks in long-term care facilities, et cetera.
So I do think that, you know, the epidemic growth rate has slowed for sure.
But the main message for all Canadians is actually not to letgo.
let's never give up. Term this is not the moment to give up. We're doing a great job.
Let's continue that until we getto the bottom of the hill and a look at what the new normal would look like.



**Reporter**:

I guess My second question would be for Mr. Duclosor perhaps the deputy Prime Minister.
We talk a lot about nursing homes and it seems to be a lot of talk and not a lot of action.
Canadians are devastated by what is going on and there are those who can't visit their loved ones.
We know that we would never let a pet suffer this way much less a loved one.
So you call it a war and a lot of people are wondering, where are the soldiers, why don't you send them in? perhaps the red cross on a humanitarian mission, to serve meals, what possible bureaucratic excuse could there be not to?



I'll start and certainly the deputy Prime Minister can add if she wishes more.
First of all, I agree with the assessment that we have to do a better job collectively as governments.
This is no secret to people, as I said yesterday, people who have experienced a loved one who lived in long-term care, there are variety of different levels of care, but some of them are atrocious as you pointed out.
This is an opportunity for all of us, at all levels of government, to reflect how we'lldo a better job.
In terms of our immediate response, I've had conversationsboth with My -- both counterparts, Minister elliott from Ontario and Minister mccannfrom quÉbec to talk about how we can support them in the short-term, including as we mentioned, resources to top-up wages for long-term care workersso that they have what they needto stay in one place and not have to work in multiple places over multiple sites.
But also helping them with the significant human resources crunch they're facing right now.
So health Canada has --s I thinki announced a couple of weeks ago -- a portal that thousands of Canadians have applied to help.
So we're working closely with Ontario and quÉbec to match themwith the appropriate resources to support them in long-term care homes and other ways that they might need within the health care system.
In fact, just checked with My deputy and there is about a thousand people right now that would be available to support quÉbec that speak both official languages.
So that work is happening right now.
I think there is two stages.
There is a short-term stage which is doing what we need now to put the tangible pieces into place that will protect people living in long-term care homes, but also people working in long-term care homes.
Then secondly, how we work together to build up a much morehumane system for all people aging in Canada.



Mari eke Walsh, "the globe andmail". how many warehouses are stockpile locations do we have across Canada? and how has that changed in the last 20 years, up or down?



I'll turn that to Dr. Tam.
Believe it or not before the pandemic, she was the Minister of health for a month and a half, so I don't have the history you're perhaps looking for.
Perhaps Dr. Tam does.



Yes.
So I think in the past decades, they stockpiled a lot of things, blankets and that material.
Those were reduced over time because other people can provide some of those, but we still deploy them and they are scattered across the country.
and we have at least five regional warehouses for general supplies.
But the stockpile over the years has been focused on stockpiling very strategic medical supplies that nobody else actually holds.
and those are very specialized and it's held in one single warehouse basically where there is very specialized conditions to maintain those medications orvaccines.



**Reporter**:

Can you just confirm, does that mean there are a total of five warehouses in Canada? and what was the hi rest number? and My -- highest number? and My follow-up question on thecbc reporting that the warehousein regina was closed and masks were thrown out.
Were those masks replaced? and why was that specific warehouse closed?



I asked My officials that question this morning when I read the story about the destruction of expired masks in the Saskatchewan warehouse.
and we'll be reviewing the practises of what we do with equipment that is near to expiry because I believe there is probably a more effective way to use equipment that is nearing its expiration date.
Certainly that was pre-pandemic and I understand the reluctance of public health agency of Canada to distribute equipment that has expired in normal times, because the first focus is the safety of the people thatuse the equipment, but there maybe opportunities -- I'm certain actually there is opportunities to look at a process where equipment is offered first of all to either parts of Canada that may not have easy access to the equipment, and if not, then overseas to other countries thatmay need it. Actual physical building, but there is essentially -- but we'll absolutely verify that.
Even for me, some of those changes because of logistical requirements, we'll definitely confirm that.



Thank you.



If I can add one more thing.
When I asked about the nature of the warehouses early on, I will say that they are considered to be an issue of national security, so releasing the exact location of warehouses is not a practise that the government of Canada has ever had because, of course, these are strategically important resources during times of pandemic or other disasters.



Hi, it's Annie bergeron Oliver.
The percentage of people testing positive is increasing.
In April we were around 3.5% and at that point you said that was a good range for Canada to be in. Now we seem to be hovering around 6%. I wonder what attributes for the change in percentage and whethercanadians should be concerned that more people appear to be testing positive for the coronavirus?



Yes, I think the percentage positive is a combination of different factors.
One is how the provinces are targeting the testing.
Obviously, targeting situations where there are outbreaks, that will get you more percentage possibly, about you what with e -- but what we want is a more significant system where people with symptoms are still tested.
So you still have 94% that are not positive.
So it shows that the country is still testing a lot of people who in the end didn't turn out to be positive, about you that shows a -- but that shows a certain amount of sensitivity in the system.
But that is also composite of the country.
So those might be different depending on the location of the jurisdiction because of the different epidemiology as well.
So it's a combination of things.
I think globally what is suggested is between 3-12% is the sort of range that people have been using as a system that has the right balance of targeting the right population, but also being sensitive as well.
But we've all said we need to improve the lab capacity in Canada.
and we're going to continue to do that.



**Reporter**:

As a follow-up, every day it seems like we're hearing more cases of health care workers who are infected.
I'm wondering, one, if you have an exact picture of how many health care workers across the country are infected? and, two, what is the federal government doing to ensure that hospitals have the staff they need as more health care workersget sick and the same for long-term care facilities?



First of all, I'll turn to Dr. Tam to speak about specifics in a minute, but I will say that the work we do around staffing of hospitals and process and protocols for hospitals is at the technical guidance level.
Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo as you know sit on the advisory committee which is comprised of all of the public health officers across the provinces and territories and it's where it's developed across the country.
The federal government has provided a number of resources.
I always say we're able to provide money, which we have to provinces and territories.
We are able to provide equipment, which we have to provinces and territories.
and guidance.
That is really the role of the federal government.
and of course any other extra special requests that each province and territory poses like, for example, human resource support, we are working diligently to provide that as well.
I don't know if that is completeenough, but I can give it to Dr. Tam to speak a few extra words.



I think it is actually quite important to look at the number of cases in health care workers which the provinces have much more detailed information on. After provinces have provided us with information that we can glean the percentage of cases that have been in health care workers ranges somewhere between the 7% to sometimes 11%. and in general the exposure setting, if you like, is actually quite varied.
a lot of of them are actually infected not at the workplace --sometimes it's due to travel, attendance at a conference, attendance at mass gathering events and certainly in social context as well.
I think that tells us of course we need to protect health care workers both at the workplace, but it's also important for them to reduce all the risk of acquiring infection elsewhere as part of the other daily life as well.
So I think both aspects.
Of course, travel and mass gatherings have been reduced.
I know of even one cluster where it involved a funeral setting where there was some health care workers as well.
So it's varied in terms of where they acquire infection.
We know today of one health worker who, unfortunately, died with COVID-19. It's unclear, I think, where that worker who is I this an environmental staff had acquired the infection and it may not be the workplace.
It may be the community, but it's under investigation by the jurisdiction itself.
So I do think, it is something that we are monitoring in every area of Canada very closely.



**Announcer**:

Thank you, doctor.
Turn back to the phone for two last questions.
Operator?



Thank you.
The next question from Canadian press.



**Reporter**:

For Dr. Tam, it seems many say that a rapid testing capacity many times what we have in Canada right now is requirement for a return to anything like normal.
First, do you agree with that? if you do, can you lay out in detail what is being done to get us to that point?



So I think certainly when there are bigger outbreaks or clusters, you can -- what your trying to determine is if an outbreak is occurring and looking at community transmission.
When we get to epidemic control of the first wave, which is our collective objective and our goal, you have to have laboratory testing.
You have to have good testing systems to detect reigniting and sparks and clustering reoccurring.
So for sure ramping up our capacity in anticipation of that period of time where we had to detect further change in transmission is very critical.
So we are doing this in a number of ways.
One is every single day looking at every avenue to increase our capacity to do the detection for the virus, which is mainly the OCR test.
So those are the tests that could be done in bigger laboratories, but the rapid testthat.
Including that, and of course, domestic supplies such as the spartan company that is providing -- this is one that health Canada had recently approved.
So trying to get as much of that diagnostic on board and that would be really a sort of great component of our strategy for those who are more in the remote and rural areas, indigenous communities, because that will eliminate the transportation time for any specimens.
But for sure any of those type of tests we're pursuing.
Making agents, ensuring we have swabs, all those things are being worked on. We have to thank the laboratory people by the way today.
and all that they're doing to help us in this outbreak.
Also then, of course, we are examining the antibody tests.
and people have asked us that, you know, about that in the past.
and we are actively testing some of those kits, doing quality assurance, making sure that they can actually detect antibodies and then further understanding the immunology of the virus.
I think all of those are streams of capacity-building that are relevant.



**Reporter**:

Thanks.
For Minister hajdu.
What do you make of the United States president's lament about the world health organization and the withdrawal of funding? how will this affect the fight against COVID-19?



**Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health)**:

Well, I think Canada values the work of the world health organization.
and we continue to commit to contribute towards the work of the organization.
It is a very valuable tool in regular times, in both its ability to detect new virus activity, to manage outbreaks of variety of different diseases around the world, to bring scientists and researchers together, to allow the capacity for countries to work together, to deal with these types of outbreaks, so we commit on a regular basis through the presence of Dr. Tam as one of the expert advisors to the committee, the special committee on COVID-19. and we know that any response tocovid-19, and in fact any global outbreak is one where countries have the capacity to pull together, pool their research and to really share their efforts to manage these outbreaks.
It will happen again and again by the way.



Thank you, Minister.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.



Following question from politico.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Thank you for take My question.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that border restrictions are going to be needed for weeks.
Many states in the United States have extended stay-at-home orders.
How long is Canada looking to extend the current limitations in place for people, non-essential people not crossing the border.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you for the question, Lauren.
You will have heard from Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo they're cautiously optimistic when they look at the doubling rate of coronavirus.
[please stand by]we are going to be very careful.
