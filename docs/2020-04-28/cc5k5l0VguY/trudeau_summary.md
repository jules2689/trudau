### Summary:


Across the country, there are other communities dealing with flooding right now too so to everyone, continue listening to officials as they work to keep you and your familysafe.
This comes during what's already tough time, but I know Canadians will continue to work together.
Shortly I'll join members of parliament from across the country for a virtual meeting of the house of commons.
Parliamentarians are working together with the same goal: supporting Canadians and keeping our country strong.
The measures we've taken so far are working.
How many new cases there are, how many losses we have to mourn, whether our hospitals cancontinue to cope, it's all up toall of us. You've already stepped up to help your family, friends, neighbours and front-line care workers stay safe, and your governments across the country are stepping up as well.
We're a big country, and we don't always agree on everything, but right now the premiers and the federal government are working together to fight this crisis.
We need common guidelines to make sure that the decisions being taken across the country are grounded in a shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us.
You already know that if your neighbourhood doesn't have new cases, if your province is flattening the curve, this is a good sign for being able to slowly look at lifting some restrictions.
To reopen the economy, there must be enough capacity to test and trace COVID-19 to control any new spread.
For you, that means knowing thatyou'll be safe at work when you go back.
At work, there will also need to be specific measures and more equipment to keep you safe.
and for hospitals, we need to make sure they can continue to cope not just for COVID-19 patients, but for everyone who needs care.
and for certain groups who are very vulnerable, like seniors and those in long-term care facilities, strong measures willhave to be in place for longer.
Whether you're facing domestic violence or living in a remote community, or a long-term care facility, we're working -- or working on the front lines, we're here for you.
We're in the midst of one of themost serious public health emergencies in our country, and if we lift the restrictions too soon, we could lose all the progress we've already made.
There are some places, particularly in seniors homes, where we're going to have to do more, and as I've already said, every single one of us will decide on how things proceed, how many new cases we'll have, how many families will be mourning, whether our health care system will be able to cope. The good news is that people aretaking the proper actions to protect themselves and others, but we must continue.
We must continue to stay home and go and do our groceries oncea week and keep a 2 metre distance from others and follow the public health directives.
For example, the ability to testand trace COVID-19 must be sufficient to be able to controlthe spread, and that's why we are intensifying testing and putting in place the necessary tools as quickly as possible.
There must also be specific measures and new equipment to protect people at work, and for certain, particularly vulnerablegroups, such as seniors and people living in long-term care facilities, more robust measureswill have to remain in place longer. -- on personal protective equipment which, along with physical distancing, is key to keeping people safe.
Every few days we receive new deliveries of vital supplies forour front-line workers.
Indeed, on this national day of mourning, we remember those who died, were injured or fell ill because of their work.
This year we pay tribute to the thousands of front-line workers across the country who deserve not just our thanks but our support. today I'd also like to update you on individual protective equipment that ensures the safety of our front-line workers.
Everyone deserves to be safe at work.
On this day of national mourning, we remember those who lost their lives, who were injured or who fell ill as they did their job, and this year we are saluting our front-line workers across the country who deserve not only our thanks but also our support. to get through this, we must work together and we must stay united.
There is no place for anti-semitism, which -- Canada'sreport found to be on the rise in our communities because hatred of any sort has no place in Canada.
