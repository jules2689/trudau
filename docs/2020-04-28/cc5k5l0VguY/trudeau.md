# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Good morning, everyone.
I know many of you have seen reports about My mom.
I want to let you know that I'vespoken with her and she's doing just fine.
I'm thankful to everyone who's reached out and want to also thank the first res ponders who were there doing an extraordinary job.
This morning our thoughts go out to those of you who live in fortmcmurray as you deal with springflooding.
Minister Blair has spoken with mayor Scott about the situation, and we stand ready to help.
To all the first res ponders and volunteers out there placing sandbags, including around the hospital, thank you.
Across the country, there are other communities dealing with flooding right now too so to everyone, continue listening to officials as they work to keep you and your familysafe.
This comes during what's already tough time, but I know Canadians will continue to work together.
Shortly I'll join members of parliament from across the country for a virtual meeting of the house of commons.
Despite the challenges of this pandemic, our democratic institutions are innovating and finding ways to keep serving people.
Parliamentarians are working together with the same goal: supporting Canadians and keeping our country strong.
As part of this sitting, at noon minister hajdu will provide an update on the new COVID-19 modelling and Dr. Tam will also do the same.
Based on the best data available, this is an updated picture of where we think we are right now and where we think things will go from here.
They'll provide more details, but here's the bottom line.
The measures we've taken so far are working.
In fact, in many parts of the country the curve has flattened, but we're not out of the woods yet.
We're in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen, and if we lift measures too quickly, we might lose the progress we've made.
So we all need to be very careful for ourselves and especially for the most vulnerable, like our parents, grandparents and elders in long-term care facilities.
Earlier this month, when we released the first modelling, I said that the path ahead was up to us. The same holds true today.
How many new cases there are, how many losses we have to mourn, whether our hospitals cancontinue to cope, it's all up toall of us. You've already stepped up to help your family, friends, neighbours and front-line care workers stay safe, and your governments across the country are stepping up as well.
We're a big country, and we don't always agree on everything, but right now the premiers and the federal government are working together to fight this crisis.
We need common guidelines to make sure that the decisions being taken across the country are grounded in a shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us. Shortly we'll will releasing theshared principles on re-startingthe economy, agreed to by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.
Let me be clear.
These are not the specific measures when you can go back towork or school or when you can see your neighbours or extended family or friends.
This framework will lay out the things that need to happen before we take any next steps.
Re-starting our economy will be gradual and careful and will be guided by science.
Here's what the guidelines mean for you.
Controlling transmission is key.
You already know that if your neighbourhood doesn't have new cases, if your province is flattening the curve, this is a good sign for being able to slowly look at lifting some restrictions.
So we need to know where things stand.
To reopen the economy, there must be enough capacity to test and trace COVID-19 to control any new spread.
For you, that means knowing thatyou'll be safe at work when you go back.
You'll see lots more testing, and if someone around you does test positive, you'll be notified quickly so you can isolate.
At work, there will also need to be specific measures and more equipment to keep you safe.
and for hospitals, we need to make sure they can continue to cope not just for COVID-19 patients, but for everyone who needs care.
and for certain groups who are very vulnerable, like seniors and those in long-term care facilities, strong measures willhave to be in place for longer.
This virus is taking a differenttoll on different people.
We must be mindful of that.
Whether you're facing domestic violence or living in a remote community, or a long-term care facility, we're working -- or working on the front lines, we're here for you.
Our priority is keeping all Canadians safe while getting back to normal as much as we can.
(voice of translator). today we are presenting the mostrecent predictions with respect to the evolution of COVID-19. In many regions, COVID-19 has slowed down, but we're not out of the woods.
We're in the midst of one of themost serious public health emergencies in our country, and if we lift the restrictions too soon, we could lose all the progress we've already made.
Even though the trends are encouraging, we must remain cautious.
There are some places, particularly in seniors homes, where we're going to have to do more, and as I've already said, every single one of us will decide on how things proceed, how many new cases we'll have, how many families will be mourning, whether our health care system will be able to cope.
All of this depends on all of us. The good news is that people aretaking the proper actions to protect themselves and others, but we must continue.
We must continue to stay home and go and do our groceries oncea week and keep a 2 metre distance from others and follow the public health directives.
Soon we will be sharing all the common principles with respect to re-starting the economy on which the federal government andprovincial and territorial governments agreed.
These principles will set out the conditions that must be in place before we can begin to lift the restrictions.
For example, the ability to testand trace COVID-19 must be sufficient to be able to controlthe spread, and that's why we are intensifying testing and putting in place the necessary tools as quickly as possible.
There must also be specific measures and new equipment to protect people at work, and for certain, particularly vulnerablegroups, such as seniors and people living in long-term care facilities, more robust measureswill have to remain in place longer.
Our priority is to ensure the safety of all Canadians as we start to see normal life return.
[ end of translation ]. -- on personal protective equipment which, along with physical distancing, is key to keeping people safe.
Every few days we receive new deliveries of vital supplies forour front-line workers.
This week we will be shipping over 6 million surgical masks to the provinces and territories.
More than 100, 000 face shields that we ordered from bauer and toronto stamp are also ready andwill be shipped out soon with more on the way.
Everyone deserves to be safe on the job.
Indeed, on this national day of mourning, we remember those who died, were injured or fell ill because of their work.
This year we pay tribute to the thousands of front-line workers across the country who deserve not just our thanks but our support.
(voice of translator). today I'd also like to update you on individual protective equipment that ensures the safety of our front-line workers.
We are receiving shipments of medical equipment several times a week.
This week we will be sending more than 6 million surgical masks to the provinces and territories.
More than 100, 000 face shields that we ordered from bauer and toronto stamp are also ready andwill be sent out very soon.
Everyone deserves to be safe at work.
On this day of national mourning, we remember those who lost their lives, who were injured or who fell ill as they did their job, and this year we are saluting our front-line workers across the country who deserve not only our thanks but also our support.
I also want to remind everyone that the businesses that requirea wage subsidy can now apply on-line.
Since yesterday, more than 44, 000 businesses have already applied on-line.
[ end of translation ]. to get through this, we must work together and we must stay united.
Now more than ever we have to stand up against discrimination and division.
There is no place for racism against asian Canadians in our neighbourhoods.
There is no place for anti-semitism, which -- Canada'sreport found to be on the rise in our communities because hatred of any sort has no place in Canada.
Today and every day we are stronger together.
Merci.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We will now take questions on the phone.
Over to you, operator.
