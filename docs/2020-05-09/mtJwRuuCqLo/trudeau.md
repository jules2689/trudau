# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

These days there are many Canadians out there who are going through difficult times because of COVID-19. The pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for our country, and Canadians are suffering the consequences.
But some individuals and some sectors are more hard hit than others.
Therefore, this week we announced additional measures to assist those who need it most.
Now first of all we're reaching an agreement with all of the provinces and territories to top-up the wages of essential workers.
Those individuals are on the front line of the fight against COVID-19 and have been from the outset, and they are doing an amazing job.
The best way of thanking them isto ensure that they are properlypaid and protected, and this week, thanks to that agreement, we are now moving forward to a new step by putting more money in their pockets.
We also announced more support to help the food supply sector get through this crisis.
We are giving more money to foodprocessors to ensure the safety of their workers.
We are also laying out special measures for pork and cattle producers so that they can adaptto market changes.
and we are setting up a program that will allow the government to buy additional products that could be wasted in order to redistribute them to charities.
All in all, our government has proposed a loan capacity of $5 million and additional money to support food safety from the outset of this crisis, and as I said earlier this week, if we have to do more, we will do more.
[ end of interpretation ]for the past few weeks, our government has been focused on getting people the help they need as quickly as possible.
But to come out of this stronger than ever, we also have to think long term.
We need to lay the groundwork now so our economy can come roaring back, and that's what we're doing with measures like the Canada emergency business account and the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
So far more than half a million small businesses have received Alan through the ceba, and less than two weeks since launching the Canada emergency wage subsidy, employers have applied for subsidies for almost 2 million workers.
Our government is giving employers more resources so they can stay in business and keep people on the payroll during this crisis.
Maintaining the connection between employer and employee will be key, not just to help people get back on their feet, but also to our economy.
In that vein, we announced yesterday that we would be extending the Canada emergency wage subsidy beyond June.
At the same time, we're working with our partners from around the world to beat COVID-19 for good.
This pandemic is a global issue.
Keeping Canadians safe and re-starting our economy means defeating the virus not just at home but wherever it is found, so earlier this week we announced new investments to accelerate the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, testing and research, including researchbeing done here in Canada.
[voice of interpreter]in recent weeks, we established new assistance programs for workers and businesses, but we know that the work is not over yet.
As the situation evolves, the needs and the challenges also evolve, and we are adjusting ourresponse consequently.
We continue to be listening to Canadians, and we are always seeking other ways of supportingthem.
[ end of interpretation ]I want to close by asking all the moms to step out of the roomfor a minute so I can talk to your kids.
I'll give you a second.
Okay.
Tomorrow is mother's day, kids.
It's a special day for all the people who are mother's day to us, our moms, step-moms, grandmothers, aunts and older sisters.
So let's show them how much we love and care about them.
You might want to get up early to make her breakfast or ask dadto help you get her some flowers.
Or if you're not together this year because of the virus or other reasons, you can draw her a card or set up a video call.
Whatever you do, I'm sure you'llchoose -- what you'll choose to do will make her day and expresshow much you love her, how much you need her and how much she has your full support and full love during this difficult time, but all the time as well.
[voice of interpreter]tomorrow is mother's day.
It is an opportunity to show ourmoms just how much we love them.
Maybe you'll get up earlier to make her breakfast in the morning or perhaps you prefer tobuy her flowers or prepare a card for her.
Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure that you will really make her day by telling her how much you love her, that you'll be there for her, and that we will all be there for each other during this difficult time.
Have fun and take advantage of this day.
We will come through this together.
[ end of interpretation ]
