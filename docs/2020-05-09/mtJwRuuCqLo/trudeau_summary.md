Maybe you'll get up earlier to make her breakfast in the morning or perhaps you prefer tobuy her flowers or prepare a card for her.
Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure that you will really make her day by telling her how much you love her, that you'll be there for her, and that we will all be there for each other during this difficult time.
