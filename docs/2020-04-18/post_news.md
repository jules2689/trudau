**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada on this Saturday morning, briefing Canadians on his government's actions to fight COVID-19. Let's bring in the cbc's Catharine Cullen Catharine, I'll pick up where the Prime Minister left off.
It is of interest in Ottawa but it should be of interest to everyone.
If no agreement is reached, 338 people have to get back here formonday for parliament to sit.



**Catherine**:

We know when we look at the two extraordinary sittings we've had is when a deal has been reached, it's an 11th hour thing.
We're going to see people engaged in this issue people biting their nails.
There is something of a face-offbetween his party and the conservative party.
They do have a deal with the bloc quÉbÉcois and they are close to a deal with the n. D.p. They are really at odds with theconservatives.
Now let's throw another element into this, elizabeth may, the green party, was tweeting if there was some sort of agreementthat would require, as she put it, frequent return to the houseof commons, she wouldn't give unanimous consent to that or letthat happen because she thinks it is a public health issue.
She was engaging with candace bergen who said she essentially agrees everyone having to come back on monday would be irresponsible, not a good idea.
It was implicit and not explicit, she was putting the responsibility on the liberals.
We need a deal to make this happen.
She said parliament isn't ready for a virtual parliament.
That's something we hear from Andrew Scheer time and time again.
They have asked the speaker to look into this process, but it would take some time.
There are some technical difficulties that make accountability challenging.
At the same time the public health concern is a big one.
Candace bergen -- you heard the Prime Minister saying some parties want four or five days a week.
Candace bergen tweeting what they would like is thee days a week, 90-minute sessions, with alimited number of M.P.s. I think that's important to flagthat nobody wants a situation where all 338 M.P.s are back.
She asks why that would be too much.
I think we heard some of that answer from the Prime Minister, as he suggested it is too much of a health risk.
So the negotiations continue behind the scenes.
Not sure whether the comments by the Prime Minister are going to move the discussion along.
I think we'll have to keep watching our e-mail.



**Rosemary**:

I think you're right.
The other by the of big news, this concerns everyone, the Canada-United States border.



**Catherine**:

a lot of canadiansmay say, status quo, this is just another 30-day extension.
But it's interesting to watch what has been happening day in and day out with the questions by the media.
Repeatedly reporters ask him to acknowledge what is in many ways think obvious to a lot of Canadians, particularly if you look at new York state right you, they say, sir, is it not apparent that the United States poses an enormous risk to us?and the Prime Minister does not want to acknowledge that, however self-evident that may be. I don't want to speculate on what's going on in the Prime Minister's mind, but there is a question whether he will provokethe United States.
We have seen the government lurching around during the course of this outbreak as they're dealing with unexpected news from the United States.
First there was a report of the United States putting troops on the border.
Then there was donald trump possibly preventing 3m from sending the much-needed n95 masks to Canada.
I think it was interesting towards the end of the conversation, rosemary, the Prime Minister said something to the effect of the deal with the United States that it would be many more weeks.
This deal extends for another 30days.
It's not clear if he was suggesting an extension beyond that as well, whether that is something they will be seeking.
So much changes in the course ofthe day.
Who knows where we will be in 30days.
The liberals have pushed that issue back for another 30 days.



**Rosemary**:

Catharine, that's great.
We'll come back to you.
You'll be on standby.
The Prime Minister spoke of the requirement to wear a mask when you're getting on a plane.
The Prime Minister making it clear that you shouldn't be travelling, that non-essential travel shouldn't be happen, but if you are required for some reason to get on a plane, you are required to wear a mask.
The other substance of the announcement was the decision toallow $306 million in loans and some non-refundable payments to indigenous small- and medium-sized businesses.
This is another sector obviouslythat's been hard hit by COVID-19. We saw the government try to getmoney to particular sectors yesterday.
a bit of a continuation of that today.
If I'm not mistaken, there's something like 6, 000 indigenous businesses across the country.
Tabatha bull joins me from toronto.



**Interview**:

Thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

How needed was this going to be?was there a real desire for additional money for specifically indigenous businesses?



**Interview**:

Absolutely.
There are actually over 50, 000 indigenous businesses across thecountry, and 95% of those are small- and medium-sized businesses.
In march we sent a letter to theprime Minister and the COVID-19 cabinet along with a number of our friends including the national aboriginal capital commission, which the Prime Minister mentioned today.
We wanted to ensure there was a way that small- and medium-sizedenterprises could access the liquidity and capital that was going out through the community emergency business account.
This is a much-needed and welcome announcement.



**Rosemary**:

This is because a lot of indigenous companies use indigenous institutions, bankinginstitutions, primarily.
So this will go directly to those, instead of to a traditional bank, as you say?



**Interview**:

That's right.
a number of indigenous businesses are also -- about 65%of them are financed through their own personal savings or loans.
They're not an existing client and Cebu is for existing clients.
So we needed another route to access the capital and liquidity.



**Rosemary**:

Another thing that struck me from what the Prime Minister said, and this is something we're seeing through various sectors, is that many of these businesses are owned and employ indigenous women.
Can you give us a picture of that and how important it is. I know it's hit a lot of sectors in the service industry.
Give us a picture of that in terms of indigenous businesses.



**Interview**:

So we definitely see women more -- double the amount of women are innovating and coming into the indigenous entrepreneur.
a lot of that helps for them to have a flexible schedule, not unlike women across the country.
a lot of the sectors hit initially were sectors where you would have a personal interaction, such as tourism.
Those are sectors where we see higher women-owned businesses.
We've seen a higher impact on indigenous women.



**Rosemary**:

Are there other things needed?the Prime Minister said this is the first step.
These policy decisions being pushed out the door quickly are sometimes not the final version.
is there anything else you're looking for?



**Interview**:

Definitely.
We've been working closely with the government on a number of the programs that have already been established.
I don't think it's intentional, but I think there's a number of factors in those programs that excludes indigenous businesses.
The wage subsidy is an example, aboriginal economic development corporations, who are a limited partnership with their community, but employ up to 800 indigenous people and a number of those organizations are currently excluded from the wage subsidy just by the way their limited partnership is set up. So we're working closely with the government to try to understand that.
Some of those businesses have laid off over half of their employees, and those are businesses that put back programming into the community.
We need to make sure they can access that wage subsidy.
Additionally procurement, we have a number of indigenous business members who are able to supply P.P.E. and able to pivot to ensure we can all fight COVID-19 together.
I would like to see some type ofincentives that we can ensure that those indigenous businesseshave an opportunity to be part of the fight against COVID-19, particularly when they can support loss of life in indigenous communities that are at a higher risk of this pandemic.



**Rosemary**:

You're talking about companies switching their supply chains to create things like masks?



**Interview**:

Definitely.
We have seen a couple of our indigenous members who have pivoted to ethanol and producing hand sanitize and a number of businesses too who have been able to access masks.
Another great business abroflex has been able to pivot to makinggowns.
We want to make sure those businesses have an opportunity to be part of the the federal supply chain and also to provide support to communities.



**Rosemary**:

Tabatha, thanks for making time for us.



**Interview**:

Thanks so much.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister's substantial announcement of aid today, $306 million of loans or non-repayable funds to go to indigenous businesses, of which there are many across the country.



> I want to go to quÉbec, to get a picture of how things are unfolding in that province, one of the hardest-hit places in this country.
Not only in long-term care homes, but across the province.
We have seen the outbreaks in the centres hard hit in that province as well as Ontario.
Let's go to the cbc's matt demur.
I do know the premier was asked yesterday and he had some frank comments about the assessment and the evaluation of his own government dealing with it.



**Reporter**:

Really what we heard yesterday from quÉbec's premier, franÇois legault, was am ea culpa, about how the government of quÉbec has handled the situation of long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that the government actually asked for assistance from the federal government to get canadian armedforces members to come into the province and help out in some ofthese facilities.
That's going to start today.
There are going to be 125 armed forces members deployed in quÉbec to help in these facilities.
We heard from the canadian armedforces that that is starting at a specific long-term care facility in montreal.
In fact, by noon people should be in that facility.
We're talking about nursing officers, technicians, and othersupport staff who are going to be going in there to try to helpout.
Premier legault essentially saidthere is a deteriorating situation in these long-term care facilities.
In fact, more than half of the deaths reported in quÉbec attributable to COVID-19 have happened in these long-term carefacilities.
Now, the premier said that his government should have tackled the situation in these long-termcare facilities sooner, especially the issue of chronic under staffing.
He said before this pandemic thegovernment should have acted quicker on trying to get higher salaries in these places --



**Rosemary**:

Matt, I'm sorry, I've got to let you go because I'm going to end the special on the main network.
You can watch us on CBC news network.[♪♪♪] [ please stand by ]



**Rosemary**:

The city of Toronto today is holding some talks about laying out potential timeline for itsreopening, even though it is still many week away from allowing that to happen.
This is all in the planningstages.
The Prime Minister, of course, has said that it will be weeks, still, before Canadians will be able to go back to some sort of sense of normal life, even if that includes going to the park, for instance.
COVID-19 continues to killcanadians everyday, particularly as we know in Ontario andquebec's long-term care homes, about half of the deaths in thiscountry attributed to what ishappening in those places.
The severe outbreaks and theinability to contain or movepeople from long-term carecentres.
As we wait for this briefing to get started, I'll bring incatherine cullen.
Anything else that stood out, interms of public health, giventhe fact we were talking about the fact things were tough.
I'll have to come back to youbecause I see the president ofthe treasury is speaking.
So let's go now to that pressconference.



We have completed tests for over 507, 000 people with 6%confirmed cases.(speaking french).



On behalf of Dr. Tam, I'llbegin with the usual daily update on the number of COVID-19cases in Canada.
There are now 31, 884 casesincluding 1, 309 deaths, 507tests have been completed with6% confirmed positive.



Dr. Tam says there is cause for cautious optimism coming through the data.
We must remain vigilant and keep or eyes on ultimate goal, which is limiting the spread of this terrible virus to protect ourfamilies, friends and our fellowcanadians.
Some parts of the country will experience the epidemics slowing down but no matter where you live in the country, everyone must remember to continue to do the things helping to stop the transmission of COVID-19 in ourcommunities.
This include swashing your hands frequently, practicing physical distancing and staying home as much aspossible.
Unless we all remain diligent in maintaining these good, newhabits, new outbreaks can be sparked anywhere at any time.



Some parts of our country will experience the epidemic slowing down earlier thanothers, but no matter where we live in our country, everyone must remember to keep doing the things that are helping to slowdown and then to stop the transmission in our communities.
This includes washing our handsfrequently, physical distancing from one another and staying home as much as possible.
Unless we all remain diligent in maintaining our new habits, new outbreaks can be sparked anywhere at any time.
Remember, as Dr. Tam also said, this is not a sprint.
This is a marathon and we need to keep on doing and keep doing the right things and keep being strong all together.(speaking french).



We will get through thistogether.
Let's take care of each other and keep hope and now, an update on the Canada emergency responsebenefit.
As we know, the Canada emergency response benefit or CERB is helping millions of canadiansand families who are facing financial hardship.
As of April 16th, 6.4applications had been filed fora total of 7.9 millionapplications, many of which have been processed.



a quick update on the important Canada emergency response benefit, which is helping millions of Canadians, workers and families go through the difficult economic times of the crisis.
As of April 16th, we have received a total of 7.9 million applications from 6.4 million different applicants.
Six of these 7.9 millionapplications, 7.6 million have already been treated.
Here with me today is markmiller, Minister of indigenousservices.
Also with us today is Dr. Wong.
Mr. Mark miller who is minister of indigenous service sand Dr. Wong, so I would first turn to Dr. Miller and then dodr.
Wong.



Good afternoon.
I want to start by saying that over the last few weeks, indigenous communities have taken many positive measures to protect their populations in the face of COVID-19 and I want to recognise their important work and the strength that they'veshown.
To the first nation Inuit andmetis leaders and elders, your continued leadership is integral to ensuring we have advancedpreparedness, planning and supports that meets actual community needs and protects the most vulnerable.
As we are all focused on the public health response that will save lives.
In addition to the previously announced $305 million in funding to address immediateneeds, and to help indigenous communities prepare and react to the spread of this virus, thismorning, the prime minister announced $306.8 million for indigenous businesses as we recognise their unique needs.
These businesses are the backbones of communities across this country and integral to thecanadian economy.
We recognise smaller indigenous businesses may be disproportionately affected by this unprecedented and unique situation and these businesses may and are already facing unique challenges such as being in rural or remote locations and having less access to capital.
The emergency funds announced today will be provided to indigenous businesses through the 59 aboriginal financialinstitutions, enabling them to keep supporting the thousands of small and medium first nationsinuit and met is businesses, great number run by women.
It will allow for short-materialinterest-free loans andnonrepayable interestcontributions offeringflexibility in supporting localbusinesses and ensuring they arewell positioned for the recoveryto come.(speaking french).



We are aware of the challenges that many indigenous communities face in theterritories, especially when it comes to air transport necessary for food supplies and other essential supplies.
At the beginning of the week, we announced financial support of$73 million to support the northwest territories andnunavut so that they can slow the spread of the virus and we will continue to work with our indigenous partners every wherein Canada to identify theirneeds.



In close coordination to ensure supplies such as ppe, bottled water, hand sanitize rand testing are in place to prevent and combat the spread ofcovid-19. In collaboration with indigenouscommunities, we will continue to adapt plans and provide surge capacity as the situationevolves.
To date, we shipped 555 orders for ppe, personal protective equipment in regards to testing, nursing stations have the supplies to administer tests and we are working to ensure consistent supply as needsarise.(speaking french).



We don't currently know how many tests have been administered off reserve for indigenous peoples and this is because one doesn't have toself-identify as indigenousduring a test, but I supportcollecting better data.
It would be helpful to collectinformation about patients andwhether they are indigenous.



Some of the great work done in communities, in a community about to open a testing unit to increase testing and awareness in the days to come.
As of April 17th, there have been 52 confirmed COVID-19 cases in first nation communities on reserve and 12 confirmed cases in Nunavut Inuit communities, as well as one death.
I would like to extend my sincere condolences to six nations of the grand river.
Our thoughts are with thefamilies, loved ones and community as they heal during this difficult time.
While we're thankful for the low number of cases in the indigenous communities to date, we are not taking and should not take this for granted.
This is a function of a number of things, note fully remoteness of the communities and some of the aggressive measures taken by the leadership, medical and political in communities learning from the experience and being in a position to what'sgone on across the glowing.
Globe.(speaking french).



Spring is upon us and with spring comes flooding season.
We are currently working with indigenous communities to ensure that they are prepared for emergency situations, including potential flooding.
For example, indigenous servicescanada gave $2.1 million to the first nation of sesawhan to reduce the risks of COVID-19 and the risks of possible flooding in that community.
This funding is based on the decision that they made to isolate away from COVID-19 in traditional hunting grounds.
This spring, two hunt goose and other traditional practises and this is a part of border health recommendations to strengthen physical distancing during the pandemic and the situation of circumstances are veryunfortunate.
That said, we're happy to support this initiative because when indigenous peoples return to the land, that is a very positive and healthy type of physical distancing for them and physical distancing is so important to prevent the spread of the virus.
This new funding will help to purchase supplies, equipment, such as tents.
We are supporting these communities throughout this difficult time and our crisis management team is constantly in touch with the first nation to plan emergency preparednessplans.



The first nations will not proceed with elections at this time due to the current health risks associated with largegatherings.
Accordingly, last week we introduced the postponement regulations that enable firstnation's leaders to continue in their positions for up to six or12 months to stay focused on keeping communities safe.
We've been in direct communication who will soon be undergoing the process and encourage communities to unveil themselves to this option.
The final decision to hold or postpone elections ultimately lies with community leadership and we must respect that.
Should communities decide to proceed with elections asscheduled, we stand ready to provide advice on measures to spread the virus to communitymembers.
All of this being said, we recognise that more support will be needed.
By working together, we can save lives and we will be there to make sure no indigenous community is left behind.
Thank you.



Dr. Wong.



Hello, I would like to begin by highlighting important public health messages.
I would like to highlight important principles about public health.
It is very important to take physical distancing seriously, avoid crowds, gatherings, avoid nonessential travel, limit contact with people who are at high risks of complications, such as the ederly, the people with underlying medicalconditions.
Isolate if sick and go home if you are sick.
It is important to practise hand and respiratory hygiene.
We need to stop smoking, stopvaping.
It is also very important to properly manage our bloodpressure, diabetes and weight.
Make sure we control or cardiovascular and pulmonarydiseases, as well.
So with that, I'm going to say, thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Wong and we are now ready to take questions.
Thank you, Minister.
We will begin by questions thephone.
One question and one follow-upper reporter and then we'll takequestions in the room.
Over to you, operator.



**Operator**:

The first question is from radio-Canada.

---

**Question**:

Hello, I have question for Minister duclos.
Minister, we have extended the border measures with the United States.
Have we obtained any guarantees that we will be able to receive essential medical supplies from the United States without any hiccups at the border or without any issues with the trumpadministration?



**Answer**:

Minister duclassociation.
Os. Thank you for the question.
As you have mentioned., our relationship with the United States is very important in this context and all contexts.
In the current situation, our United States-Canada relations are veryimportant.
We have conversations with ourpartners every single day.
The border agreement that wereached a few weeks ago has beenextended for another 30 days.
and we need to ensure thecontinued flow of essentialsupplies, food, medicines.
Have we received a guarantee tothat effect?



Yes, and we are confident in extending this deal for another 30 days.
and, of course, we have discussions about other topics with a view of flowing supplies across the border in bothdirections.
Our Canada-United States relations arevery important and are verypositive and we work very hardto maintain a good, strongrelationship.
I was saying what most canadiansunderstand is that therelationship with our friend andneighbour is not only importantin all aspects but absolutelyessential in the currentemergency context.
We are pleased with the factthat we were able to renegotiatethe agreement that we hadachieved just a few weeks agofor the next 30 days, whichachieves a number of differentobjectives, but one is theabsolute necessity to keep themovement of essential goods andservices across the fronteirs inboth way.
Because goods go south, northand those goods, medical, foodand other things are foreignmaintain the security and healthof Canadians.

---

**Question**:

I have a very specific question about personal protective equipment at theborder.
Have you received a guarantees from the American government that 3m and other americancompanies will be able to export medical supplies and protective equipment to Canada?will we be able to import thesesupplies from americancompanies?have you received a guaranteefrom that effect from theamerican government?will we be able to receivemedical supplies and especiallypersonal protective equipment?



**Answer**:

Minister duclous.
S.the word word is vigilant.
These past few weeks, we haveobserved that essential goodsincluding medicine have beenable to flow across the bordervery well, but the motto isvigilance.
Yes, we have a very goodrelationship with the americangovernment, but thisrelationship will continue to beput to the test over the nextfew weeks.
We will remain vigilant to ensure that our Canada-United Statesrelationship, which is currentlyvery strong, we will ensure thatit continues to remain strong inthe next few weeks.
The essential discussion inaction that we have around thetransit of medical goods and ithink we first must admit thatthings are going quite well withefforts on both sides of thefrontier, meaning we havemedical goods in both directions in the current crisis.
This being said, we need to bevigilant because thatrelationship is going to betested for the rest of thecrisis.
We have citizens on both sidesof the border that are anxious, that are in need of beingreassured and that's exactlywhat the responsibility of thefellow government is, is to notonly to provide the essentialflow of those medical goods butalso to reassure Canadians thatwe will always be working in therelationship and movement ofthose goods.



Thank you, Minister.
Next question.



**Operator**:

Our next question is from Teresa wright.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Minister ducal association.
Os. You said that the numbers are giving us cause for cause anxious optimism and canadiansare starting to see numbers in their provinces improving andthey're going to question when we can get to the new normal.
So what can we tell them?



First two things.
At the broad level, yes, there is cause for cautious optimism this being said, we need to be very mindful that thesignificant, considerable and difficult efforts that canadianshave been making over the last few weeks need to be maintained.
We don't want to lose what we have gained.
Although we want to beoptimistic, we need to be cautious and maintain the clear guidance of health Canada, public health Canada and all public health officers acrosscanada.
The absolutely guidance that we need to maintain physicaldistancing, wash our handsregularly, stay at home as much as possible and avoid nonessential travel.
So we really want to keep maintaining our efforts because if we didn't do that, we would end up losing all of the gain that we have acquired, that we have made over the last fewweeks.

---

**Question**:

Thank you.
Minister miller, you mentioned the regulatory changes that you made with regards to first nation elections allowing the leaders to continue in their roles for up to six months, but there are some indigenous leaders saying this should have come sooner.
Manitoba first nation is going ahead with an election, believe today.
How concerned are you about their safety in this voting process and why didn't these regulation changes happensooner?



Thank you, Teresa and in regard to the first nation that is going ahead with thiselection, we're working closely with them to make sure that Otis done observing the strictest health protocols to ensure that everyone stays safe.
It is ultimately, and if you respect self-determination, isultimately their decision to goahead or not.
You can imagine the immensesensitivity around enacting newregulations around the indianact which is colonialistinstrument and as we move beyondthe indian act, we mustrecognise there are certainnations that still operate underit.
It gives them the flexibility todo that.
Where I, as the Minister ofindigenous services, did nothave that ability, is animmensely delicate operation.
It meant some level ofconsultation to ensure that wewere getting it right.
We moved as quickly as we canand knowing the machinery ofgovernment in respect of anenacting regulations and howslow that can be, I'm proud athow thew moved and the rapidityin which they were put in place.
It allows for decisions takenpreviously to postpone, to beconsidered valid and ensure thecontinuity of governance.
I would not say there was agovernance gap created under thecurrent clauses of the indianact.
There was a governanceinconvenience in band managersthat may not want to assume thepower and the uncertainty aroundwhat leadership tools would beavailable to address COVID-19. The focus is on the healthresponse and these are of atemporary relations.
They expire after a year andshould we need to reenact them, we will assess at that time, butthey have narrowly tailored toaddress a very important set ofcircumstances, namely to ensurethat there is leadership, continuity in the face of aglobal pandemic allowing firsttwo nations pursuant to theirrights of self-determination.
So we must respect thosechoices, but we'll be workinghand in hand with communities to ensure that those electoraldecisions are taken with themost information possible and inthe strictest of respect of thecurrent health protocols.



Thank you, Minister.
Next question.

---

**Question**:

Our next question.

---

**Question**:

Mellow.
I have questions for Minister duclos.
For a question about military medics being sent into long-termcare facilities in Quebec as oftoday.
The government hasn't given usmuch detail about where theywill go. They mentioned the st region.
Could you tell us where thesemilitary medics are sent todayand how many are sent and towhich regions?



**Answer**:

Minister duclassociation.
Os. Thank you for your question.
I would like to thank actors in both governments who have worked hard to make this happen very, very quickly.
We all recognise the urgency of the situation the government ofquebec has a primary responsibility to handle thesituation, but the federal government is also responsible for quickly stepping in to help after receiving the request that we received.125 medically trained force swill be deployed in Quebec.
The government of Quebec will manage their deployment.
The government of Quebec will identify it's needs, where the needs are on the ground and the government of Quebec will decide what responsibilities these armed force's members will have.
We've heard it is satisfied with how quickly we have stepped into make this happen.
These individuals will be sent to facilities where needs arepressing.
The government of Quebec is satisfied and that said, the federal government must continue to help in any way that it can, given the importance and urgency of the situation.



**Operator**:

Now a followupquestion.

---

**Question**:

I'm getting the impression you don't know where the needs are dire and maybe you can answer on Minister Freeland.
There was a Minister's call with the provisional and territorial premiers and remuneration of essential workers was discussed.
Had a deal been reached with provinces regarding salarypop-ups for essential workexperts what decisions have beentaken and which workers willreceive these top-ups.



**Answer**:

We are starting to realize in Quebec and every wherein Canada that many essential workers are not sufficientlyremixer n e. R.a. T derick.
Remunerated.
Another element you mentioned isthat the government of quebecwants to help provinces andterritories and everyone wantsto help essential workers.
As Minister Freeland said, thesetalks are going well.
Everyone is on the same wavelength.
Now it's a matter of finding theright ways to act, the rightways for the federal governmentto provide financial support andsalary pop-ups.
There are jurisdictional issuesand the government of Canada, ofcourse, wants to providesupport, but must do so in sucha way that they protect thejurisdictions.

---

**Question**:

B. C.'s success iscredited with good tracing andontario seems to be laggingbehind.
Will the federal government stepin and mandate provinces toincrease testing and are youconcerned that provinces thatare lagging behind will pulldown those that have come ahead?



You are absolutely correct in describing testing and tracing as being key and actions in thecovid-19 process.
We also understand that different provinces face different circumstances.
and in Quebec and the federal government is always not only willing but most often always able to provide guidance that may be helpful in the local circumstances and provide any logistical support and any procurement support when it comes to making equipment and testing equipment available to provinces and territories.
So we want to do this as much as is needed and that's what we will continue to do.

---

**Question**:

With regard to those that are on old-agesecurity or disability benefits, those that have a fixed income, what's being done for thosepeople who might be facingmounting costs with regard togroceries or transportation orcost of living on a fixed incomeand is there any talk with theprovinces about making sure thatcerb doesn't affect theirreceiving federal benefits?



Well, that's making ends neatmeetis a large source of anxietdparticularly lower income andthat's why we acted very quickly putting into place measures that the federal government certainly never implemented and probably never envisioned, such as thecanada emergency responsebenefit, but also increasing theist tax credit, providing support to families with children and in particular, families with lower nextsthrough the child canadabenefit.
As the Prime Minister keepssaying, we are working in an emergency situation which requires continuing actions and continuing forms of support.
So we are going to continue as the Prime Minister again said, continue being mindful of the anxiety and the difficult circumstances which thecanadians are going through, but also renewing and developing our continuing support to thosecanadians.

---

**Question**:

I'm with CBC news.
B.c. is talking about, perhaps, easing up some of therestrictions next month is thenumber of hospitalizations andcases go down.
At a federal level, what is thebar that we have to meet inorder to relax some of theamericas?cases?



Thank you, that's a very good question and a very good question which Dr. Tam had answered regularly over the last few days.
and I don't have the same expertise and, perhaps, the credibility as Dr. Tam would have in responding to that important question.
But let me summarize which would probably say, it's around not only the curve, but where the curve may be heading and it'salso around the capacity of the health system.
It's also about the number ofdeaths, the number of emergency intensive care units that are needed and it's about the ability of workers to be protected in the environments in which they would have to work.
It's about the ability of securing enough equipment under different scenarios.
But since we have Dr. Wong and since Dr. Wong is probably a lot more credible than I would be in that area, perhaps Dr. Wong, you would like to add your own view?



Thank you.
a number of factors that we all have to actually look at, as minister duclos had just said, we have to look at not just thecurve, where it's going, but also we have to look at the local and the community and the provisional and the national picture because it depends on the interface between differentfactors.
All of those really determine how one, you would consider, perhaps, easing some measures in one situation and not easing some measures in othersituations.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

I'm alsowondering, how many blue med medical tents does the department have ready to send to communities and when exactly what that happen.



Are you speaking of the indigenous communities?



Exactly.



We have that number and it can be used for differentsolutions, whether isolation ortesting.
It depends on the needs of the community and as we look at the pandemic plan and possible expansion which hasn't occurred in communities, but we have to examine and consider thosecommunities, we will ramp upresources.
We have a number in stock available in the process of being deployed in the communities that have asked for this and have it as a part of their pandemic plan.
I don't have those precisenumbers..it's a moving variable as werecognise there may be surges incommunities, but it's very muchsomething that we are assessingon the fly, but we have a numberprepared to be deployed and havebeen deployed in somecircumstances.
I'll let tom answer moreprecisely.



With the mobile structures, we are looking forward to supporting indigenous communities in order to expand the capacity, to deal with overcrowding issuestemporarilily, while addressing the longer-term housingchallenges, as well, trying tocreate a safe space in order toprovide services such astesting, such as taking theswabs, such as isolation, as well as overflow, you know, fortemporary medical help ornursing help in the community.
All of those are a part of acomprehensive approach that wetake.
Thank you.



Turning back to the phone, operator.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Our next question, please goahead.

**Question**:

My question is for minister duclos.
You spoke about how thecanada-United States relationship will betested in the upcoming weeks.
When trump expresses impatienceand a strong desire to reopenthe american economy, does thatworry you?



**Answer**:

As an economist, given the current circumstances, if we want to reopen theeconomy, then we must be very, very cautious, especially when it comes to public health.
We have made major sacrifices these past few weeks.
We have been isolated and we have felt anxious and we have also made economic sacrifices.
People have lost their jobs.
People are having difficulty making ends meet.
So we always have to weigh public health outcomes and economic outcomes..in the next few weeks andmonths, we will have to be very, very cautious.
Of course, many of us areanxious to reopen the economy.
That said, we must absolutelyfollow the recommendations of our public health experts.
We must take the necessarypublic health measures if wewant to reopen the economy.
Followup question.

---

**Question**:

All right.
So that was your economist'spoint of view.
Now what's your point of view as a Canadian as a canadiancitizen?president trump wants peoplemoving around freely as soon aspossible.
How do you feel about that?could that compromise publichealth and safety in Canada?



**Answer**:

Minister duclassociation.
Os. No, I'm not worried.
Our public health experts are very trustworthy and moreover, our municipalities, province sand territories are doing such an excellent job when it comes to public health and spreading public health messages.
I think we can be very proud to be Canadian right now.
Our healthcare system is robust and at some point, we will reopen the economy.
The federal government has Avery solid financial position, so we will be able to roar back at some point and when we want to roar back, it will be essential that all levels of government cooperate and work together all while respecting public health measures.
So when we're ready to roarback, all levels of government will work together and we will reopen the economy.
Thank you, Minister.
That concludes today's pressconference.



**Rosemary**:

The federal cabinet Minister's briefing and public health official'spreving.
Briefing.
Let me give you some information in the Canada relief benefit, the CERB that many of you have tapped into because you have lost work or lost your jobs due to COVID-19 and he says there have been 7.9 millionapplications.
Just to give you a sense of how much the economy is struggling and how many of you are, too, are turning to the government for support.
Catherine Cullen has been listening along with us and I'mnot sure if anything else stood out for you.
We did get new numbers on covidoutbreaks in different indigenous communities.



**Reporter**:

Let's talk about what Minister duclos said when he was asked about the protective equipment across thecanada-United States border.
I thought it was interesting hesaid they'll have to remainvigilant on this particularissue and did note while thecanada-United States relationship is agood one, it's one that has beentested and he said it wouldcontinue to be tested over thecourse of the next few weeks, and that goes back to the pointwe were talking about beforethis news conference started.
That the government officials donot want to politician italy sata great source this is, as wesee the picture across theproblems and territories and thepicture seems to change fromstate to state, too, and a lotof attention being paid to newyork city state.
The government does not want to say it's a significant concernbut obviously, this 30-day 30-dyextension on the border is arelief to government trying todeal with a large number ofother issue.
We heard recurring conversation, once again, with the Prime Minister today, withjean duclos, as well, whencanada can talk aboutrestartingthe economy.
It is very clear this is asituation that will change fromregion to region and everyone issaying the watch word is cautionand this needs to be donecautiously and carefully.
There's incredible concern abouteasing things too quickly andseeing a major resurgence andeveryone is looking at expectssouth of the border but morebroadly international and ithink singapore comes to mind, where they're trying to restartthe economy and restart society, but concerned that one falsemove could lead to a majoroutbreak.
I would note something we'vebeen talking about over thecourse of the programme which isthe situation is long-term carehomes.
While they may be in some waysisolated from society morebroadly, they're obviously amajor source of concern rightnow.
It's a significant contribution, I guess, we can say, to thenumber of deaths we're seeing incanada right now.



**Rosemary**:

Probably it will look not only different region to region, but probably it will look different in terms ofsociety.
Vulnerable people, seniors, older Canadians will probably be living under different restrictions than other people for some time because they are the ones most susceptible.
So you can see a ramping down of measures and maybe parks will open to kick around a soccerball.
But restaurants only open at 50%capacity.
We are seeing some of that happening in other parts of the world and so that gives us some indications of what that might look like.
Dr. Tam was not there today butmr.
Duclos say they remain cautiously optimistic about what they are seeing.
But again, I think everyone is saying we can't let go now because then everything thatwe've done for past four or five weeks will be lost, potentially.



**Reporter**:

That raises couple of points.
One about testing and if I could echo Dr. Tam for a minute and weknow, perhaps, what she mightsay, something we've heard repeatedly is this question of the curve.
Yes, perhaps, you've reached the peak but that's only 50% of the cases and you have to be certainwe've heard her say time and time again, be mindful of what happens on the way back down, because that is 50% of thecases.
Again, the need for ongoingvigilance.
We would talk about testing, as well, a question Ashley burkeraised when speaking to the prime Minister and she pointed to research out of harvarduniversity which suggests for the United States to sort of open things back up, they need to be doing something in the neighborhood of half a million tests or upwards of that.
Ashley asked the prime minister whether there was a specific number he had been advised of for Canada in terms of the level of testing needed and he did not certainly come close to engaging in specific numbers, but did saythat, too, is uneven across thecountry.
Where there are somesomejurisdictions doing well, hschoosing words carefully, saying there are other jurisdictions trying to improve their efforts.
That is one piece of the puzzle.
You talk about kicking around the soccer ball and that's an ice mental image for us rightnow, but obviously, there aredecisions, too, about what the picture looks like.
I thought when you were speaking about what's happening -- thediscussion, I should say ofwhat's happening in California the governor talking about the prospect of Ok. perhaps we would reopen restaurants, but menus would be disposable and all of the precautions taken.
You can imagine that just one false move would cause everybody to snap back, as well.
So it's really a very dynamicconversation, but one that think people are hungry for answers to, as well.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for your help today.



> I want to turn to mariaalonzo, an er nurse in downtownvancouver.
Good to see you.
How are you?



I'm doing good.



We want to talk to you, because you've made the decision that some other front-linehealth workers have made andthat is you are not living withyour family right now to protectthem.
So what you are doing.



I just checked on them yesterday and so I'm off rightnow.
Yeah, I'm trying to spend time with them right now, especially with My son and My mom.



But you are typically staying hotel.
is that what you are doing?



So what happened, the hospital support the staff and that if you're living with your family and you're traveling far to your work, you have times to stay during your work time and so that's one of the support they giving to the staff rightnow.



That's good.
Tell me how you are in terms ofequipment, masks, gloves, do you have enough or is that a concern for you?at the moment, in the hospital, we have enough so far and wehave enough supplies forprotective measures right now.
We have the face masks, the n95face shields and all of thestuff right now.
I think we have enough suppliesso far.



How do you feel going into work everyday because we know that as well as older Canadians, the people that are most vulnerable are healthcare workers and we have even seen an umber of deaths.
How worried are you going into work everyday.



Working in emergency is verychallenging, but this pandemic is quite different.
So every time I go to work, always have the fear that it might affect My family, youknow.
I have a fear that I might getinfected, as well.
So I just need to be more careful at work so that I will not pass it to My loved ones andfamily.



Well, particularly your mom, right, who is in her 70s.



Yes, My mom is 72 years old, and I'm very, very careful and very doesn't from her at thistime.
So we just need to protect ourfamilies, really.



Maria, is there anything else you need from the government?is there anything else thatwould be of help for you to doyour job more easily?



I know our country is doing the best to support all of thecanadians and then as a nurse, so we just actually doing our best to protect our patients, to protect ourselves, to protect our families.
But then I think the government is doing a good job at thistime.
So I think we just need to work together and we will get through this pandemic.



Well, maria, thank you for your work because you're doing all of the hard work for all of us and we appreciate it. Stay safe and healthy.
Thank you very much.



Thank you.



That's maria Alonzo invancouver.
Across, across the country, Canadians are trying to help others affected by COVID-19. Senator Jim mun son is one of those helpers.
It might surprise you what he'sdoing.
He plays recreational hockey with a group of old-timers andi'm sure he won't be offendedwhen I say that.
When the season was cut short, his fellow league membersdecided to do something.
Good to see you, Senator.



Just another Senator, Rosie not playing hockey.[ laughter ]



That's right.
There's a lot of them these day.
So you have this league, I guess like a fun league, recreational league.



We are the legends.



The legends, Ok. and it got shut down, obviously, because no one is able to do anything and what did you guys decide to do?



Well, it was a unanimousdecision, we got shut down because of COVID-19 on march13th, friday the 13th and nomore hockey.
But we have lots of money leftand a refund of $4, 200.
So our chief organizer, whothought he's going to get a taxdonation back, a refund back, hetopped it off to make the $7, 000in the kitty.
We're not trying to blow our ownhorns but show other hockeyteams across the country whatthey can do. So $7, 000 has gone to the ottawafood bank and the ottawa missionhelping those who live onstreets and need a safe bed.
So $7, 000, we like to look atthis AIs an ice hockey movement, not a grass root's movement, butan ice hockey movement, and weare encouraging other teamsacross the country and peopleinvolved in figure skating clubsto donate money to theircharity, even if you have acredit for next year.
It's not much money, but atleast it does something and itshows that for the sake of a fewmore wings and too many beers, that we can give back to ourcommunity.[ laughter ]



It's a smart idea because, obviously, this is the first wave of some sports being shutdown, but I'm not sure soccer and other things are going to be starting up quickly any time soon and there may be other places where that will work, too.



Well, of course, it will.
There are other names we have used like the rusty blades and that was taken.
So a lot of us feel we'relegends in our own minds and our#hockeylegends helped.
This is $7, 000 and this couldgrow to $70, 000, $700, 000 acrossthe country and, perhaps, eventhose soccer teams you talkedabout, they may have money linedup to start practicing and startplaying.
Well, they can't right now, buteven that money, a bit of thatmoney could go a long way and anindividual figure skater orindividual hockey player coulduse the refund to help a charityof his or her choice.



It's a good idea.
Senator, I'll ask you the other part of your job question, ifthat's Ok. Yesterday or the day before, losing track of time, the senate decided it would suspend sittinguntil, I think, the beginning ofjune.
As you know, the house of commons is grappling with that right now and they have yet to reach an agreement on what'sgoing to happen on Monday What are your thoughts on that?



My thoughts on that is that we have to be responsible.
Our committees can meet virtually and we can pass legislation if legislation comes to us, but we think it'sextremely important to live and work by example and work from home and there's no place -- we should not be sitting in the senate of Canada.
Canadians have been asked to stay at home.
We can also work from home and get our jobs done, whether it'sadvocacy or legislation.
So we have postponed untiljune 2nd.
Doesn't mean our work is notdone, but I think that traveling across the country at this time is not a smart thing to do. What are we doing?we're staying home, working andenjoying our families and we'regiving back and as politicians, I think that we have to be very, very cautious, very cautious.



You probably were in thesenate, though, over the past couple of weeks to help with the legislation because you are in the region.
and did it work?were there any problems with alimited number of people there?



We had 26 senators there and everybody spoke on the pieces legislation that was before us. and there was physicaldistancing, six feet.
It worked and it can work again, but I think it has to be working on an individual basis when pieces of legislation come to us in that way.
I mean, the thought of having virtual parliament, it can work, but that's another work to bedone.
In the meantime, we have create din our senate a social affair'scommittee and finance committee to meet and hear witnesses, to take account to what the government is doing or not doing and how society is coping.
So we can still sound as second thought and listening tocanadian's concerns.



Senator, good to talk to you about politics and beer league hockey and your contributions topeople.



Don't forget to give, youknow.
Stay on the ice, but do it through money.
It's an ice hockey movement.



Thank you, Senator.
Good to see you, s always, stayhealthy,.
