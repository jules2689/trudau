We are standing by, as we do every day almost to hear from the Prime Minister for his daily update on the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yesterday Justin Trudeau unveiled more than $2 billion in rescue money for Canada's slumping energy sector and other key industries like tourism.
Today we are expecting to hear more about additional help for indigenous businesses that may be taking a due to the pandemic.
Justin Trudeau is also addressing the nation on a day that the Canadian military begin an operation to combat COVID-19. 125 personnel are being deployed to quÉbec to assist some overwhelmed staff in the province's long-term care homes.
QuÉbec requested that had he been in an effort to contain thedeadly outbreaks that are sweeping through the facilities are and of course in the province of Ontario as well.
That is a scene you are familiarwith at this stage, the front door at the Prime Minister's residence, Rideau cottage.
We will hear from him in 15 minutes' time.
I want to bring in Catharine cullen who is here to help with coverage.
More than half a million tests have been completed and testing is important to get a handle on things to allow the economy to reopen and restrictions to loosen.
The Prime Minister has been asked those questions virtually every day this week.



**Catherine**:

That's right.
He says it's key to moving forward.
Any attempt to reopen the economy will depend on testing.
The world health organization, an organization that we should say is under added scrutiny, but it put forward this week six criteria for any jurisdiction that's looking at moving forward and widespread testing would be a part of that.
Canada, according to many experts, is not at a point to reopen the economy.
Even beyond that there is a debate of larger jurisdictions, notably Ontario, they are still trying to ramp up to a level that everyone is happy with to deal with the situation as it is, let alone allow people to return to people's lives not as normal, not to some sense of normalcy.



**Rosemary**:

B. C. is already having that conversation.
Of course they were testing at much higher rate than other provinces and according to their public health officer, Bonnie Henry, have flattened out the curve.
There was a move last night that came late in the day by the federal government to start I guess putting different measures in place as things ease up.



**Catherine**:

That's right.
Anyone now who enters an airport, anyone who is doing any airline travel will need to weary non-medical mask, a cloth facecovering.
When we're talking about membersof the general public, they do not want people using those medical masks, but more and morepeople who have gone out of their house see people with those masks.
If you're in an airport or anywhere you cannot maintain that physical distancing, you will have to wear a face covering.
That would be going through security or an I. D. check, border checks, getting on the plane itself.
Monday at noon you will be expected to have some sort of face covering.
There will be exceptions for people under the age of 2 and people who have mobility issues.
This is for moments in the airport where you wouldn't be able to maintain safe physical distancing.
This also came with guidelines for other modes of transportation as well.
This raises questions about other places in society where people are unable to maintain that 2-metre distance as well, rosie.
We heard from Dr. Njoo wednesdayin the briefing, could we see a scenario where there is widespread guidance that Canadians should be or must be wearing masks when they go outside.
Obviously that would be quite anevolution over the course of thelast few weeks.
First they were saying, no, theydidn't want to see people wearing masks and people would be touching their face.
Now the public health officials are saying, if you'd like to, you may.
and now Dr. Njoo says the science is evolving.



**Rosemary**:

Now new York state is saying you have to wear a mask on things like public transit.
As restrictions are eased, other measures have to come into play.
Catharine, I'll come back to you shortly as we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister in Ottawa.
Obviously the coronavirus continues to claim lives in long-term care facilities.
More than half of the deaths in this country have occurred in those places.
Because of that, some family members are choosing to bring their family members home.
Ilene Smyth is one of those who removed her mother from a care home earlier this week.
Good to see you.



**Interview**:

Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

How is your mother doing, Ilene?



**Interview**:

Mom's doing very well.
She's obviously happy to be home with family.
It's a challenge.
She has dementia.
She's unable to follow directions and, you know, she could possibly have mood change sand all that.
But My husband is home as well.
So between both of us, we're managing pretty well.



**Rosemary**:

Good morning.
I'm glad to hear that.
Explain to people how you came to this decision, where your mom, who you mentioned has dementia, that your mother needed to come live with you fora period of time.



**Interview**:

Well, about the third week in March I was reading the news and listening to what was happening in long-term care and it became very scary.
I mean, a lot of people were dying.
There was no help.
The personal support workers forscared to go and work at a lot of these homes.
So My fear was that My mother would die alone.
She's unable to follow any sort of isolation.
So it became a nightmare for me. Then I got a letter from the home stating that they're not going to be transporting the seniors who get sick to the hospital.
In other words, a similar situation who gets the ventilator, I understand.
But at that point there was -- you know, they were so low supplied with P.P.E., you know, essentials.
So when I heard families on TV and heard of families in a nightmare where a parent would die and they wouldn't even know where the parent went.
So they were having nightmares about that.
In the end I made the decision that after doing some calls to the government and finding out where I stood exactly to bring My mother home.



**Rosemary**:

Were there cases ofcovid-19 at the time in her residence or have there been since?



**Interview**:

No, there were no proven cases of COVID-19, which gave me a good in to get My mother out.
Because I'm not sure what the situation would be had there been one contracted there.



**Rosemary**:

and I believe you're a part-time nurse or you were working as a part-time nurse, so that gives you an advantage that other people might not have because it is a lot to take on. How much of a factor is that?



**Interview**:

Yes, well I still work in a doctor's office in Barrie and I do relief, but right now the count is way down.
So I had this opportunity to be home.
As well -- and My husband as well.
So between the two of us, you know, we made that decision.
and I think I did make it at the right time.
Yes, so that made it possible for me. I had had My mother prior to her going and being crises getting admitted into the home that gave me an advantage.



**Rosemary**:

Does it worry you about having to send her back? because, if anything, this pandemic has exposed, Eileen, that long-term care homes are obviously struggling during thispandemic, but may be we are not doing enough for older canadiansacross the board.



**Interview**:

Well, the government could be a little more lenient to families who want to take their loved ones home.
It was a real dilemma for me because when I called the actionline, the ministry of health, the lady told me that My mother would lose her bed, that she would go on the waiting list as a pre-admit, and not sure when she would get back in. My question to her was is the pre-admit over or below the crises list? because I know the crises list is probably in a couple thousand.
She couldn't answer that, but she did leave the phone and scamback with an answer and said it was below the crises list.
At that point I e-mailed My local M.P.p. and voiced My concern and also e-mailed -- youknow, a detailed e-mail.
I heard back from that office three days later.
and I was -- he said he would put it to his superior.
But I had not heard anything since.
The last phone call was to ccac who deals with mom's particular area.
She explained to me that My mother would go on a re-admit list, but she would be a priority at the very top if I call them in the 90-day span from now or this past week, theni won't have to go through the paperwork so that the next bed that becomes available at the home will be available to her.
Now, if I go past the 90 days --as you said, this may go on -- then what am I going to do? so that's an issue for sure.



**Rosemary**:

All right, Eileen, I know many people are struggling with these same issues and it was a difficult decision for you to make.
I can tell your mom is still very much full of life and is happy to be there.
I wish you good health and take care.



**Interview**:

Thank you very much.



**Rosemary**:

Eileen Smyth in Barrie, Ontario.
In Ontario there are more than 100 long-term care homes who have outbreaks of COVID-19. So we're talking about almost one in six homes.
That has been the picture, not only in Ontario but definitely in quÉbec and to some extent in British Columbia as well.
Let's go to the cbc's megan batchelor in vancouver because British Columbia is ahead of the curve, has flattened the curve, and is now already talking about ways to reopen and what that might look like.



**Megan**:

Yeah, Rosie, we're seeing data coming out of British Columbia and Dr. Bonnie Henry being cautiously optimistic that some restrictions are being lifted.
We're seeing a slow down in the increase in cases across the country in particular in ontarioand in quÉbec.
B.c. is also changing the way that it's doing its modelling.
It used to compare the number ofcases to those in italy or hubeiprovince in china, those real hot spots, the epicentres of COVID-19. Now they are not comparing the worst-case scenario from there, looking at what could perhaps happen to our medical system here because we are starting to see this flattening of the curve.
Now officials here are starting to develop new models, looking at the cases that are happening short term, and projecting those, assuming there is no change in the current measures.
They're also looking at what could happen if they start to ease some of the physical distancing restrictions.
We say that now with the restrictions in place, contacts between british columbians is 30% of normal.
They do say they could go up to 60% of normal and not see a reemergence of COVID-19 in British Columbia they are still looking ahead at that second wave that we keep talking about.
The officials here are preparingfor that and adjusting their modelling there.



**Rosemary**:

Megan bachelor in Vancouver.
a different picture on the west coast.
That is the issue with COVID-19 is that the chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa tam, has talked about regional epidemics.
Every province looks a little bit different.
So easing back some of the restrictions will happen on different timetables in different parts of this country, and that will make it challenging likely for the federal government, who only has to much say how this is going tounfold.
As we wait for the Prime Minister, he is expected to be on time.
I'll bring back My colleague Catharine Cullen, but I may cut you off.
Yesterday the Prime Minister made significant announcements in terms of money.
One of them was to address the oil and gas sector, although it was in no way a bailout.
There was criticism in industry that this is not enough to get them through everything.
The premier was also very welcoming to it, as were is many many environmentalists.



**Catherine**:

Indeed.
They put together $1.7 billion to deal with orphaned wells as well as another chunk of money -- and I am watching the doorway as you are -- to help those in the oil and gas industry embrace I guess I could say new methane emissions.
This is something industry expressed concern about, whether or not they could do it. The government is putting forward this money to assist with that.
That is why they're getting the thumbs up from many environmentalists, helping the oil and gas industry reach a environmental bar is good way to spend the money.
The next question is the number of jobs create by this.
In the cases of the orphaned wells, this is thousands of jobs they are going to create.
I can see the Prime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

Let's go to him.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada speaking.
