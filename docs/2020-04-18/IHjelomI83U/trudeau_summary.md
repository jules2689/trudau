### Summary:



I want to start by confirming that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by another 30 days the border measures that are in place.
This is an important decision and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe.
It's another example of the excellent collaboration between our two countries, and I want to thank Minister bill Blair for leading the discussions with the United states.

In recent weeks, we have announced historic measures to help you to get through this crisis, with the emergency benefit, the wage benefit, and the loans for small businesses, we are supporting millions of families and workers right across the country.
There are still people we need to help.
Our government will allocate more than $306 million to help indigenous businesses.
This funding will be provided through financial institutions and the national association of indigenous associations.
The investments announced today will help thousands of businesses to hold the line until things get better, including many businesses that are led by indigenous women.

Very soon we will be announcing other measures to support indigenous businesses and their employees.


[end of translation] this morning I am very happy to announce that the government will allocate more than $306 million to give indigenous businesses the support they need.
It will allow indigenous businesses to access interest-free short-term loans so they are better able to make it through and rebound after this crisis.
Today's investment will help thousands of businesses bridge to better times, including many that are owned and run by indigenous women.
These businesses employ people right across the country in small communities and in big cities alike.
They create good jobs in a wholerange of sectors, so when we support them, we're supporting families and workers too.
We'll have more to say soon on the help for indigenous businesses and the people that rely on them.
Small business owners are at theheart of so many communities, and this is a tough time, whether you own a store, restaurant, or are part of the hospitality sector.
We're going to be there for you and with investments like the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy, we're focused on helping you.
