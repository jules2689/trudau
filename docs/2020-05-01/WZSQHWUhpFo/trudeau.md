# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Tiff macklem as the next governor of the bank of Canada.
He has extensive experience in the global financial system and risk management.
With his appointment, the bank of Canada will be well-positioned to help with the economic response and eventual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
I also want to note that May 1 marks the beginning of asian and jewish heritage month.
Unfortunately, we've seen a rise in anti-asian sentment lately and, this week, two more anti-semitic incidents took place.
It's important to celebrate who we are at all times and not gives in to hatred or fear.
When times are tough, Canadians come together.
That is who we are.




**Interpreter**:

On December 6, 1989, I was in Montreal in cegep.
At the both of the hill to polytechnique.
I couldn't tell you what I was studying that day, but I will never forget the moment when I heard the first reports of a shooing at polytechnique.
At first, I was shocked.
I was 17 years old and I couldn't understand how such an act of violence toward women could happen in a country such as ours.
In a society such as ours.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Every Canadian has their version of this story.
Every one of us realises that, even in Canada, a man with a gun could Ir revocable alter our lives for the worse.
We remember how our sense of safety was shaken.
How our world view was changed.
Ecol polytechnique, mayerthorpe, Dawson college, moncton, la loche, the danforth, Quebec mosques, Fredericton and Cumberland, colchester and haunts counties, Nova Scotia.
These tragedies reverberate still.
They shape our identity.
They stain our conscience.
They make adults out of children.
and the heartbreaking truth is they're happening more often than they once did.
With each passing year, more families are ripped apart by tragedy.
More parents are struggling to explain the inexplicable to their kids and more teenagers are growing up in a world where gun violence is normalized.
It needs to stop.
Last week, 22 Canadians were killed in the deadliest rampage in our country's history.
They were nurses and teachers, correctional officers and RCMP officers.
They were someone's child, someone's best friend, someone's partner.
Their families deserve more than thoughts and prayers.
Canadians deserve more than thoughts and prayers.




**Interpreter**:

During the last election, we committed to banning assault-style weapons and we put in place a programme to buy back these weapons.
We announced our intention to work with the provincial and territorial governments in order to allow municipalities to ban handguns.
We also promised to take other measures in order to save lives.
In October, Canadians confided in their elected officials a clear mandate -- to restrict the use of these weapons in Canada.
and we intend to maintain our engagement.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today from military-grade assault weapons in Canada.
We are banning 1500 models and variants of these fire arms by way of regs.
-- regulations.
These weapons were designed for one purpose, and one purpose only -- to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.
There is no use and no place for such weapons in Canada.
For many families, including many indigenous people, firearms are part of traditions passed down through generations and the vast majority of gun owners use them safely, responsibly, and in accordance with the law, whether it be for work, sports shooting, for collecting or for hunting.
But you don't need an ar-15 to bring down a deer.
So, effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military grade assault weapons in this country.
To protect law-abiding gun owners from criminal liability until they can take steps to comply with this new law, there will be a two-year amnesty period and we will legislate fair compensation.
and I want to take a moment to recognize the leadership of Minister blair on this file.
Tackling gun violence has been a personal and professional priority of his for decades.
He's done incredible work to make this policy a reality and we're here today, thanks to his leadership and to the leadership of people like him.
Merci.




**Interpreter**:

Today we are closing the market on military-grade assault weapons in Canada.
We are banning 1500 models and variants of this type of firearm.
These weapons were used for one goal -- killing the largest amount of people as quickly as possible.
They have no use and no place here in Canada.
Throughout the country, many people use fire arms legally and responsibly finish -- for work or for hunting but you don't need an ar-15 Ir order to shoot a deer.
From this moment on, it is no longer permitted to sell, to buy, to transport, to import or to use military-grade assault weapons in Canada.
In order to protect responsible owners from criminal liability.
There will be a two-year amnesty period so that they can comply to these regulations.
We have the intention of tabling a bill in order to ensure fair compensation southerly.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

An entire generation of Canadians will remember where they were on Sunday, April 18, 2020.
They will remember how their sense of safety was shaken.
How their outlook on the world was forever changed.
They will remember the day that they lost some of their innocence.
This chapter in our history cannot be rewritten.
But what happens next is up to us. We can stick to thoughts and prayers alone or we can unite as a country and put an a end to this.
We can decide, together, that enough is enough.
Today's announcement builds on the things we did during our first term.
It's the next step.
and there is more work ahead to implement this and pass legislation to further strengthen our laws.
I've already spoken with the other parliamentary leaders and I know that we will be able to work together and do even more to keep Canadians safe.
Every single Canadian wants to see less gun violence and safer communities.
So today, we take another big step forward.
Merci.beaucoup.



Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
and good morning, everyone.
Before I begin My remarks, I'd like to take the opportunity to extend My sincere condolences to the families of those that were lost in the helicopter crash off the coast of Greece on Wednesday.
We will always remember their service and their sacrifice.
I'd like to thank you all for joining us here today for what I believe to be a very significant and yet solemn occasion.
a few weeks ago a, Canada suffered its worst mass shooting in the country's history.
22 innocent lives were lost over the course of a weekend rampage across beautiful community throughout Nova Scotia.
Canadians were shocked and they were heartbroken and as we learned the identities of the victims of these terrible crimes, we were reminded of the tragic impact that gun violence can have on all of our communities, urban and rural, from coast to coast to coast.
Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbours were taken from us, terribly violently and far too soon.
and sadly, gun violence is not a new thing in our society, but it's made all the more deadly with the proliferation of fire arms that are more powerful than ever before.
Assault-style fire arms, those that were not designed for hunting or sport shooting, they have become more and more prevalent in our canadian retail market.
and for as long as these guns have existed, they have been capable of inflicting tremendous damage when they fall into the wrong hands.
and, for example, in 1989, 14 women were murdered at ecole polytechnique, a horrific act of deadly mysoginy.
17 years later, montreal was shaken yet again with the shooting at dawson college.
In 2014, moncton was terrorized by a criminal that took the lives of three RCMP officers.
and three years ago, in January, in Quebec, a shooter killed six innocent muslims while they were in prayer.
Many of us have vivid and tragic memories of each of these events.
They had become, sadly a part of our history.
These tragic moments when innocent women, worshippers, police officers and innocent Canadians across the country have been killed by evil people wielding powerful guns.
For decades, chiefs of police, advocacy groups, grieving families and everyday Canadians have been calling for a ban of these types of fire arms, guns that were designed for soldiers to kill other soldiers, and not for recreational purposes.
Guns that belong on a battlefield and not on our streets.
Guns that were designed to kill people.
They were intended in their purpose to kill people.
and they have been used in Canada to kill innocent people.
and for decades, Canadians have been call on successive governments for reform for stronger gun control.
and we have listened.
and today we are taking action.
Today, as the Prime Minister has said, we are announcing an immediate ban on over 1500 models of assault-style fire arms and, effective immediately, these newly banned firearms can not be legally used, sold or imported in our country.
and as of today, the market for assault weapons in Canada is closed.
Enough is enough.
and we are ending the proliferation of these weapons and the militaryization of our society.
From this moment forward, the number of these guns will decrease in Canada.
We heard many people express concern about the militarizization of our police and this is a direct consequence of militarizization of society and Canadians destoefsh live in a society where they can be safe and secure and people from coast to coast have been clear -- we cannot risk another shooting in a school or a place of worship or another attack on police officers or on women or on innocent Canadians anywhere in this country.
Banning assault-style fire arms will save canadian lives.
I'd like to take moment, if I may, to speak to the law-abiding canadian gun owners.
I know from very many years of experience as a police officer, that the overwhelming majority of gun owners in this country are law-abiding.
They are responsible.
They are conscientious.
They acquired their weapons legally.
They store them securely and they use them safely.
They respect our laws and we respect them.
I want to assure hunters and farmer and target shooters in this country, that nothing that we are doing today or will do in the future is intended to interfere with this lawful, responsible and legal activity.
However, we are today ending the availability of weapons that were not designed for hunting or for target shooting.
They were rather designed for soldiers to kill other soldiers.
and while I appreciate that some may feel that these weapons have recreational value, the tragic reality is that these weapons were designed to kill people and have been used to kill innocent Canadians.
Public safety must always be our first priority.
and these powerful fire arms become deadly weapons when they fall into the wrong hands.
Protecting human life must come above all else.
These guns have no legitimate civilian purpose.
They don't belong in our communities.
and I will also say that the banning of these assault weapons an important step, but let me also acknowledge that we know that there is much more to do. We will introduce legislation at the first opportunity to fulfill our commitments to Canadians, to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening our storage laws, by preventing gun trafficking and smuggling.
We will bring in greater control of ammunitions and magazine capacities and perhaps most importantly, regular flag laws that allow law enforcements to remove fire arms from dangerous situations, to make sure that they don't become deadly.
We will empower victims, communities, doctors, families.
We will empower Canadians to enter their situation safe.
and where there is firearms in a situation that could be dangerous, we know that situation can become deadly.
and red flag laws will empower us to keep Canadians safe.
We will do all of these things and we will keep working hard to make our streets safer for our kids and grand kids.
I would remind us all that, over the last four years, we have taken real measures to strengthen gun control.
We have invested over $327 million to fight gun and gang violence that meant, for example, more resources for local law enforcement to investigate gang-related activity.
It meant funding for projects, which were focused on keeping kids in school, giving support to victims of human trafficking and preventing gang recruitment.
We brought in bill c-71 which strengthens background checks to make sure that guns don't end up in the wrong hands and last year, in the fall, we campaigned on a promise to do more.
Today, we are moving forward on our promise and our plan to deliver safer streets and stronger communities for generations to come.
By taking action today, we can give our kids and our grandkids a better chance at a brighter, safer tomorrow.
Thank you all very much.







**Interpreter**:

Good morning.
I'm proud to be here with My colleagues and the Prime Minister to talk about important measures that we are putting in place.
We know that the number of crimes committed in fire arms have increased over the past years.
In 2017, there were 2500 additional victims.



Too often where weapons that were designed for use on the battlefield have made their way into our community and have been used to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.
Minister Blair mentioned tragic incidents that live in the mind of all Canadians.
Mothers and fathers, children, friends and neighbours whose lives were taken in senseless acts of violence.




**Interpreter**:

As a montrealer and also as a father of two daughters, and family member of a former cegep student, I can tell you that the shooting of 14 young women in poly technique is very fresh in our collective memory.
Even 30 years later.



We all remember Anastasia d'souza whose promising young life was tragically cut short at Dawson college.
French french 



**Interpreter**:

We saw sadness and terror and this allowed us to have a more strict regulation of fire arms.
The fire arms act put in place new regulations in 1995.



In 2019, Canadians gave us a clear mandate to act.
As Minister Blair explained, today we are moving forward with this commitment by announcing an immediate prohibition of over 1500 makes and models of military-style fire arms.




**Interpreter**:

These are military caliber, military-grade fire arms that were created in order to have the most victims as quickly as possible.



We are, however, taking reasonable steps to provide Canadians with the time and guidance to properly and safely deactivate or remove these items from their possession.
To do this, we are putting in place an amnesty order under the criminal code.
Beginning today and effective until April 30, 2022.
This amnesty period will give a lawful owner in possession of these newly prohibited fire arms a reasonable time frame to come into compliance without facing criminal liability for unlawful possession.
By the end of this amnesty period, all Canadians must be in compliance with the law.




**Interpreter**:

There are clear lines on what is allowed and not allowed during this amnesty period.



Anyone in possession of these newly-prohibited firearms can no longer use them, even during the amnesty period.
Secondly, these fire arms cannot be imported or sold to individuals in Canada.
Third, these fire arms can be legally exported during the two-year timeframe with a valid export permit.
In addition, a business owner may return the firearm to its manufacturer.
Finally, these fire arms must be safely stored in accordance with the law.
They can only be transferred or transported for the purposes of deactivation, export with a permit or surrender to police without compensation.
Or if the person is not the only owner of the firearm, to return the firearm to its rightful owner.
There will be an exception for indigenous people's exercising hunting right, as well as those who use the weapon to hunt or feed their family.
They may continue using firearms that were previously nonrestricted for these purposes until a suitable replacement can be acquired.
We are asking that no one attempt to surrender their firearm while social distancing because of COVID-19 is being practiced.
As I have indicated, at the end of the amnesty period, all firearm owners will have to be in compliance with the prohibition.




**Interpreter**:

The character of the nation is defined by how it reacts to tragedies.
Our country is more united than ever.
and we need to continue to work together.
The measures that we are announcing today are banning the most dangerous weapons, which represent the most significant threat to Canadian communities can.
That is what we promised to Canadians and we owe it to them and to all of the victims who lost their lives too soon.
Thank you.



**Interpreter**:

Hello, everyone.
Mr. Prime Minister, colleagues can.
We are all fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.
But we had the worst shooting in our country, 22 people died at the hands of a heartless gunman.
Canadians shared the burden felt by our neighbours in Nova Scotia and we understand the impact of armed violence in our communities can.
This is nothing new.
But what is new, however, is that this virus is more violent because of the proliferation of guns that are more violent and more lethal.
They have no use for guns or sport.
These weapons can kill too many too quickly.
In '89, there was poly technique shooting.
In 2006, Dawson.
In 2014, moncton.
and on January 22, 2017, there was a young man who killed six brothers, fathers.
Motive can change from one tragedy to another.
The context can change.
The targets of these killers can change.
Their m. O. can change.
But there are two things that remain the same.
There are always innocent victims who leave behind an emptiness that cannot be filled in the hearts of their loved ones.
Also, we cannot change the fact that there are weapons that are made to kill and these are weapons that we will be banning today.
Chiefs of police, families, citizens have been asking for prohibition of these weapons that were created for warfare and not for civilians in our communities.
Today we are acting -- today we are acting for the future.
We are banning more than 1500 types of military-grade assault weapons.
Today marks the end of the market for these weapons.
Before moving forward with this, I want to make sure that you know that most gun owners in Canada are law abiding and take all the measures to make sure that weapons are used and kept securely.
However, these weapons are deadly and pose too great a risk when they fall into the hands of wrong people and the safety of the public is paramount.
The measures we are puting in place today and it is a part of a measure to reduce armed violence in Canada.
We also need to take on contraband of these weapons of handguns.
We need to take on street gangs and invest in prevention and we need to have more education, more support and mental health.
The work has started and we are going to continue it. We started by investing $327 million over five years to counter gang and gun violence.
We will be adopting c-71, that verifies the criminal history of buyers to make sure that weapons do not fall into the wrong hands.
and today, we are going one step further, one significant step further, a historic step further that will save lives and make our society safer for all.
Thank you.



Good morning.
I grew up on a farm in northern Alberta.
We had guns on our farm.
and we still do. As on many farms across our country.
If there were bears around, My dad would keep a gun in his truck and sometimes he'd hunt prairie chickens on his way home for supper.
and you know what? neither My dad nor any other farm early I knew then or have known is since owned an assault rifle or an assault-style rifle.
That's because those weapons are not for hunting.
They aren't for shooting a prairie chicken.
Or scaring off a bear.
They're designed for only one purpose -- to kill people and to look like they can kill people.




**Interpreter**:

When we reflect on the massacre of the 14 women at ecol poly technique to shooting at Dawson or at the horrible tragedy that occurred in Nova Scotia in Portapique 12 days ago, this reinforces our determination.



a massacre of 14 women at the ecol poly technique in 1989 or the Dawson college shooting in 2006, or the horrible tragedy in Portapique, Nova Scotia, just 12 days ago.
Those heinous acts strengthen our resolve and that resolve is to close the gaps in our gun control laws and to keep the most dangerous fire arms out of civilian hands.
We neither need or want such weapons in our homes, in our pickups, in our communities or on our streets.
These guns make it easier to commit mass murder.
and the culture around their fetishization makes our country inherently more dangerous for the people most vulnerable.
and that is women and girls.




**Interpreter**:

To all the women and girls, they all have a story to tell.
About a moment where they felt vulnerable or in danger.
It is unacceptable that, in 2020, that gender is still a factor that determines whether or not you feel safe at home and in your community.



Every woman and girl listening today remembers a time when she was made to feel unsafe, vulnerable or in harm's way.
We all know what that's like.
It's unacceptable that, in 2020, gender continues to be a determining factor in whether you feel safe in your home or on your street.
During this pandemic, we are particularly concerned about the rise in gender-based and domestic violence.
Frontline organisations have seen a surge in appeals from women and children fleeing violence.
British Columbia's battered women's support services has received 300% more calls since the beginning of the pandemic.
a toronto-based shelter has seen a 400% increase in demand for shelter.
and unfortunately this isn't new.
From 2010 to 2015, according to statistics compiled by the canadian domestic homicide prevention initiative, there were 418 cases of domestic homicide in Canada.
With 476 victims.
Of the 427 adult victims, 79% were women.
Let that number sinker in. -- sink in. In 2019, according to the canadian femicide observatory for justice and accountability, 118 women and girls died violently in Canada.
On average, one every three days.
Again, let that number sink in. 



**Interpreter**:

We also know that the availability of these fire arms is a danger to vulnerable populations like women, queer and trans, indigenous people and people of colour.
Women, girls, two-spirited people who are assassinated or missing are one of most significant examples.
and it's a clear tragedy because of these violence in our country.



Assault-style weapons puts vulnerable populations, women, queer and trans people and people of colour and indigenous people at risk.
The murdered and missing indigenous women, girls and two-spirited people are, for me, one of the starkest and most tragic examples of systemic violence.
Tackling systemic violence is our collective responsibility.
One that requires us to challenge our attitudes, strengthen community support, ensure accountability for perpetrators and critically keep deadly weapons out of their hands.




**Interpreter**:

Violence is a serious problem in our society.
and we need to put an end to it.



Has long been a scourge in our society.
It remains a scourge.
We must stop it. and saying no to assault-style weapons, we are putting femininist ideas into practice.
We are acting to ensure that our sisters, our mothers, our grandmothers, our daughters and we ourselves, indeed that all women who have been victimized frightened, threatened, harmed, brutalized and killed by gun violence have not suffered in vein.
Enough is enough.




**Interpreter**:

Enough is enough.
Thank you.
