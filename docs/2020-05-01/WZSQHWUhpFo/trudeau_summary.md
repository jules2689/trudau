When times are tough, Canadians come together.
Every one of us realises that, even in Canada, a man with a gun could Ir revocable alter our lives for the worse.
More parents are struggling to explain the inexplicable to their kids and more teenagers are growing up in a world where gun violence is normalized.
Last week, 22 Canadians were killed in the deadliest rampage in our country's history.
Canadians deserve more than thoughts and prayers.




Today from military-grade assault weapons in Canada.
These weapons were designed for one purpose, and one purpose only -- to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.
There is no use and no place for such weapons in Canada.
For many families, including many indigenous people, firearms are part of traditions passed down through generations and the vast majority of gun owners use them safely, responsibly, and in accordance with the law, whether it be for work, sports shooting, for collecting or for hunting.

He's done incredible work to make this policy a reality and we're here today, thanks to his leadership and to the leadership of people like him.




An entire generation of Canadians will remember where they were on Sunday, April 18, 2020. We can stick to thoughts and prayers alone or we can unite as a country and put an a end to this.
and there is more work ahead to implement this and pass legislation to further strengthen our laws.
I've already spoken with the other parliamentary leaders and I know that we will be able to work together and do even more to keep Canadians safe.
Every single Canadian wants to see less gun violence and safer communities.
So today, we take another big step forward.
