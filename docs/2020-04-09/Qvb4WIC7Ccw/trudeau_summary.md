### Summary:


As stark as those numbers are, they aren't a surprise for Canadians. We all knew this was going to be tough time and that countries around the world are in a similar situation.
We're also working on legislation to bring in a wage subsidy to help employers keep people on the payroll while working on new loans for business owners.
and once they do, you can be sure that our country will come roaring back.
On vimy ridge, more than 100 years ago today, thousands of Canadians gave their lives so that our country would know peace. In the women and men who continue to step up and serve us in uniform and our nurses and doctors who put themselves in harm's way for us all to stay healthy.
That means we have the chance todetermine what our country lookslike in the weeks and months to come.
That means that our actions are even more important in terms of determining what our country will look like in the weeks and months to come.
We'll have to continue to stay home and continue to wash our hands.


[end of translation] over 100 years ago today, Canadians showed what mettle we are made of. I know each of us will rise to be worthy of the legacy of heroes that built this country.





[voiceof interpreter] we'll be there to help Canadians as long as they need help, but we all know that the time this will take depends very much on what we're doing.
Canadians have to continue to stay home on whether they do that or whether we continue aggressive testing, or on whether we continue to do aggressive contact tracing.
If we do that, we'll be able to meet those minimal projections and come through this first wave.
But no matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians in order to get through this.
and once we're through this first wave, as we look to the resurgences that will happen over the coming months until we discover a vaccine, we will be much better equipped both with aggressive testing strategies that we're developing right now with aggressive contact-tracing and with Canadians who know whatto do when they have to sociallydistance to stay home where and when necessary in the coming months.



That is one of the reasons why it is so important to come through this first wave as quickly as possible.
That is why that in the coming weeks people will have to stay home and limit their movements as much as possible.
When we come through this first wave as we saw in the modelling, we will be able to open up the economy to a certain extent and set aside some of those restrictions as we manage the new reality so that economic activity can start up again.
However long this may last, we will be there to help each other because that's what we do as Canadians and we know that if we want to get back to a normal life at some point, people need the necessary support to come through this.



We have seen that the measures that have been taken have been taken seriously by Canadians right across the country.
They're working from home as much as possible and these are the measures we know are going to keep us on the right path. sure, and we'll keep looking at those, but the big things we're going to be able to improve in the coming weeks is stronger and more sophisticated and aggressive testing protocols, because every day we get better at that.
Normality will not come back full on until we get a vaccine for this and as you say, this could be a long way off.
It will require continued actions in different places and quick responses, but part of getting through this wave in a rapid way will be because we are developing the tools that will also help us when those waves coming forward in the coming months.


[voice of interpreter] what we are seeing is that even if we come through the current wave we will not be able to return to normality the way it was before until there isa vaccine.
and that could take a year or year and a half, we don't know, but we hope it will come sooner.
But our ability as a society andthe ability of our system to respond to these small waves andthese small challenges that we'll face with these more localized outbreaks with better tools will allow us to start up economic activity again, but we will have to remain vigilant in the year to come.
This is news that reflects particularly in the job numbers a reality that millions of Canadians have been feeling over the past weeks.
That the real impact on not just our economy but on the lives of Canadians, families, workers, communities, is significant and real.
That if we keep doing the things that we're doing the way we're doing, as we've seen in other countries, we're able to minimize the level of the impact of this wave of COVID-19. We are, unfortunately, going to continue to lose people across this country in the coming weeks, but we also know that there are things that we can continue to do to make sure we get through this first wave as quickly and as low-impactly as possible.
That is why as we gather with the immediate family members that we're sharing a home with right now, as we facetime to ourloved ones and reflect through this easter weekend, we need to know that we will continue, we can continue to do what is necessary for the coming weeks and months to get through this first wave in the right way, so we can get back to being there for each other in the coming year.
and, of course, we want to continue to seek ways to work together and ensure that we can keep our strong democracy and our strong institutions working.
It's important we have strong democrat we can institutions that continue to function and serve Canadians to get the help needed to Canadians and provide that input from voices across the country on the impact that things are having in their community.
and we're going to continue to talk with opposition parties about how we can make sure that our institutions and parliament continues to function.
It is something to remember when we do gather in smaller numbers, first of all, it's still requires a significant number of support staff to come into work, to be there while parliament is functioning and that puts them at risk as well.
But it's also something that doesn't allow for members of parliament who live in further parts of the country to be weighing in and make sure that their communities are being heard.
That's why we're so interested in looking for virtual ways of gathering the house and we're going to continue to work on that.
But I think it's really important that parliamentarians get together to make sure that the work of getting the help to Canadians happens, and happens quickly, while these continued conversations about furthering our democracy in this moment of crisis continue.
It's not the time to further delay getting help to Canadians.
So for me, recalling parliament is not just getting them to, youknow, give their stamp of approval, no, it's because we have an opportunity to debate and do the right thing for Canadians.
I think it's really important that we hear voices from every corner of the country on the potential impacts or potential improvements to the bill we're putting forward.
I think that's how parliament is supposed to work and that's how Canadians consider the parliament is supposed to work, so I very much look forward to the debate on our wage subsidy to see how it's going to impact, and hear from every corner of the country as much as we can on how we can make sure that it's doing the right things for Canadians.
The challenges we face in terms of getting Canadians protected are echoed around the world.
and why we need to continue to listen to experts on other things we need to do to ensure we're having the minimal possible impact on Canadians.
They may have little tweaks and improvements to make and we look forward to working with them on suggestions or amendments that they have, but there seems to Beau sense from the official opposition that this is a moment to define or determine how parliament will function in the coming weeks and they are negotiating around the structures.
We've put forward proposals around things we think could work to both minimize the risk to Canadians while moving towards a virtual parliament.
and we hope that the official opposition will choose to realize that we need to pass this legislation quickly to get the help out to Canadians as quickly as possible.
They recognize that it's important and they may want to propose certain amendments and we're certainly open to that, but the official opposition is insisting that this is a time todetermine what parliament shouldlook like in the coming weeks and bringing in very strong measures.
and, of course, we're open to talking about this, but we believe this should be done in parallel with the normal legislative process because the bill needs to pass as quickly aspossible in order to help Canadians.



We made the decision early on that we needed to be aggressive and broad in getting help out to Canadians.
and we moved very, very quickly and we are continuing to fill gaps and look at areas where we can do more to help Canadians.
But we knew that our best chance of rebounding from this strongly and getting back to the extraordinary successful economy and country we've had, that we've built over so many generations, is to ensure that the Canadians are supported through this however long it takes.
Now we are extremely hopeful that we will be able to begin to restore a certain measure of economic activity in the coming months after this first wave haspassed, but we will make sure that every step of the way we'regiving Canadians the support they need to be able to keep themselves safe, to do what is necessary to keep us all safe and to ensure that as we get going again, Canada continues to be successful for all Canadians.
We hope it will only take a few months for this first wave and that will allow us to start getting things back on track economically, getting people back to work with additional measures so that we can continueto succeed as a country, but whatever time it takes, we will always be there to support the Canadians who need help. So for the months that will take and there are some estimates that say six or eight months, some say a year, year and a half, we will have to be vigilant.
We will have to have measures followed as part of our normal life and at the same time we'll have to have measures ready to introduce if there is a resurgence of the virus in certain areas of the country or under certain conditions.
But once we come through that first wave, we want to be able to allow some economic activity to start up again and that is why there will be a graduated return to normal economic activity compared to now.
There are things that we will not be able to do, but there will be more things we will be able to do and that is if and only if we come through the next few weeks and months properly.
When we think of generations of Canadians who have made sacrifices in the major wars including vi my 100 years ago, but there are Canadians across the country that have made sacrifices for many years in order to build the country that we have today.
I know it's difficult, what we're doing now and what we're experiencing, and that's why the government is there to help vulnerable Canadians, to help people who are losing their jobs, to help people that need to support their families.
These people ensure that we'll be able to come through this andmeet this challenge the right way.
We will continue to lean on eachother and we will come through this because we're strong Canadians and as a country.
Now with respect to the indigenous people, we're very concerned and we have been very concerned from the outset about the vulnerability of those communities and that's why we have made investments, we made investments right away to improve the resilience of those communities, but we know there are is still a lot to be done and there have been a few cases in certain communities which is very much a concern and we're working very seriously on this.
We will share the best recommendations with Canadians.
