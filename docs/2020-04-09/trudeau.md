**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I'd like to talk about the job report we received from March.
As stark as those numbers are, they aren't a surprise for Canadians.
Each one represents a different story.
a worker who has been laid off.
a family having to hunker down.
a community that is anxious about today and tomorrow.
We've all seen the impact of COVID-19. We all knew this was going to be tough time and that countries around the world are in a similar situation.
That is no comfort if you're out of a job, if you're having difficulty making ends meet.
You need real support.
So we're doing our best to help you bridge to better times.
On Monday, we launched the Canada emergency response benefit more than 4.5 million claims have been processed, which means people are already receiving their $2, 000 for this month.
We're also working on legislation to bring in a wage subsidy to help employers keep people on the payroll while working on new loans for business owners.
We will keep expanding our three-point economic plan to protect jobs, support business owners and get everyone the helpthey need.
Things will get better.
and once they do, you can be sure that our country will come roaring back.
As a country, we've gotten through tough times before.
We've stood together, united andstrong.
On vimy ridge, more than 100 years ago today, thousands of Canadians gave their lives so that our country would know peace.


[voice of interpreter] today we remember those who fell at vimy.
We remember the sacrifices that they made for our country.
They fought to defend values that are dear to us such as equality and peace.
For values that still define ourcountry.


[end of translation] historians have noted it was when ordinary people did extraordinary things.
Fathers and sons, brothers and friends, their sacrifice and courage defined what it is and what it meant to be a canadian.
and their legacy lives on. In the women and men who continue to step up and serve us in uniform and our nurses and doctors who put themselves in harm's way for us all to stay healthy.
and in everyone who steps up andasks what they can do for their fellow Canadians.
That is what makes Canada strongand that will be our path forward no matter what tomorrow may bring.
Right now, the future can seem even more uncertain than normal.
If you've lost your job, if you're worried about an elderly parent, you probably want to know what to expect.
Earlier today we released our modelling on how we think this pandemic might unfold.
The modelling shows that COVID-19 arrived in Canada laterthan in other countries, so we're in an earlier stage of theoutbreak.
That means we have the chance todetermine what our country lookslike in the weeks and months to come.
Our health care systems across the country are coping for the time being but we're at a fork in the road between the best andthe worst possible outcomes.
The best possible outcome is no easy path for any of us. The initial peak, the top of thecurve, may be in late spring, but the end of the first wave inthe summer.
As Dr. Tam explained, there willlikely be smaller outbreaks for a number of months after that.
This will be the new normal until a vaccine is developed.
But as we saw that is so much better than we could face all ofus if we do not rise to the challenge of this generation.
The path we take is up to us. It depends on what each of us does right now.
It will take months of continueddetermined effort.
We'll need to keep practising physical distancing, staying home, and washing our hands.
It will help.
It will help get the numbers that Dr. Tam was talking about between 4, 000 and 44, 000 deaths as low as possible.


[voice of interpreter] I know that Dr. Tamand the entire team at the public health agency have workedvery hard to prepare those projections and to ensure us that all the information is up to date.
We are in constant communicationwith the provinces and territories to get their latest data.
Earlier today we released our projections.
The models show that COVID-19 arrived in Canada later than in other countries, therefore, we are still in the early stages ofthis epidemic.
That means that our actions are even more important in terms of determining what our country will look like in the weeks and months to come.
For the time being, our health care system is holding strong, but we are at a crossroads.
The path that will take us to a better result will not be easy.
We could reach the peak at the end of the spring, and the firstwave could end in the summer.
But as Dr. Tam explained, DE will probably see other outbreaks, smaller outbreaks, for a certain number of months.
It is and will be our new reality until we find a vaccine.
But as we saw this mornin -- but as we saw this morning, it'sa better scenario than what could happen if we refuse to act.
The path we take will depend entirely on all of us. We will have to be disciplined in the next few months.
We'll have to continue to stay home and continue to wash our hands.
That is how we can avoid the thousands of deaths and reduce the number of cases.


[end of translation] I know it'stough to stay home, especially as the weather gets nicer.
If you have kids, it's even tougher.
But to get them back outside andrunning around the park as soon as possible you need to keep them inside for a little longer.
This will work.
We'll be with you every step of the way.
Just this week we received millions more masks to keep our front-line workers safe and we have contracts to get more ventilators.
We're helping industry mobilize like the entrepreneur from Ontario who is creating reusablevisors for hospitals across the province.
and we've continued to support canadian researchers working on a vaccine.
We'll pulling out all the stops to beat this virus and help you get through this time.


[voice of interpreter] we must all do our part, governments, businesses, and citizens, so continue to stay home.
Continue to do your groceries once a week only.
Or even less often than that.
and if you must go out, do keep a two-metre distance between youand other people.
That is how we can protect vulnerable people.
That is how we can protect our seniors.
That is how we will save lives.
and that is how we can help our nurses and physicians who are doing an extraordinary -- who are doing extraordinary work every day.
I know it's not easy, but it won't last forever.
At some point, we will be able to go back and watch a film, or go to parks, but for now, everyone must do their part.
Now and for the coming weeks.


[end of translation] over 100 years ago today, Canadians showed what mettle we are made of. I know each of us will rise to be worthy of the legacy of heroes that built this country.
We can do this together.



**Announcer**:





**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] I'd like to hear you comment on the waves that Dr. Tam referred to earlier.
I would like to know that seeingif this could continue into december, you're prepared to renew all of your aid programmesuntil then.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:



[voiceof interpreter] we'll be there to help Canadians as long as they need help, but we all know that the time this will take depends very much on what we're doing.
Canadians have to continue to stay home on whether they do that or whether we continue aggressive testing, or on whether we continue to do aggressive contact tracing.
If we do that, we'll be able to meet those minimal projections and come through this first wave.
Yes, there will be other waves until there is a vaccine, but those waves will be much easier to manage with the knowledge andthe equipment we have now and through Canadians' new habits and their ability to keep themselves safe.


[end of translation]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize that what we're doing today is making a difference.
We're hopeful we're going to be able to get through this in the shortest amount of time.
But no matter how long it takes, we will be there to support Canadians in order to get through this.
We know, though, that in order for it to last as short as it can and to harm as few canadiansas possible, we need to keep doing what we are doing.
That is what leads us to the best scenario.
and once we're through this first wave, as we look to the resurgences that will happen over the coming months until we discover a vaccine, we will be much better equipped both with aggressive testing strategies that we're developing right now with aggressive contact-tracing and with Canadians who know whatto do when they have to sociallydistance to stay home where and when necessary in the coming months.



Follow-up.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] weunderstand that helping Canadians have no price, but I'dlike to know if there is an assessment of the cost that has been done over the next few months and can we afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more, possibly until december?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

That is one of the reasons why it is so important to come through this first wave as quickly as possible.
That is why that in the coming weeks people will have to stay home and limit their movements as much as possible.
When we come through this first wave as we saw in the modelling, we will be able to open up the economy to a certain extent and set aside some of those restrictions as we manage the new reality so that economic activity can start up again.
Of course, everything depends on what we're doing now.
However long this may last, we will be there to help each other because that's what we do as Canadians and we know that if we want to get back to a normal life at some point, people need the necessary support to come through this.



Thank you.
Next question, the Canadian press.



**Reporter**:

Good morning.
I'm just wondering, given the new projections today, do you think that we're going to have to have stronger measures necessary to keep people at home? do you think people are listening? and what are those measures that you think we might need to add?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We have seen that the measures that have been taken have been taken seriously by Canadians right across the country.
People are staying home.
People are choosing to go out only for necessities.
They're working from home as much as possible and these are the measures we know are going to keep us on the right path.
Are there things we can do to strengthen and improve? sure, and we'll keep looking at those, but the big things we're going to be able to improve in the coming weeks is stronger and more sophisticated and aggressive testing protocols, because every day we get better at that.
and continuing to develop tools for better contact-tracing.
We know that those things on topof the social distancing that we're doing right now have the best impact on keeping this curve as short and low as possible.



Follow-up.



**Reporter**:

I'm also wondering, if there are going to be multiple waves of this, and we're not going to be able to get out of this until we find a vaccine which is 12 to 18 months away at best, do you envision we're going to have multiple waves of shutdowns, closures of the economy? and how can we handle those constant shutdowns?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I think even after we're through this first wave, we'll need to remain vigilant and bring in different measures.
Normality will not come back full on until we get a vaccine for this and as you say, this could be a long way off.
Once we get through the first wave, we will have developed both tools and habits that will allow us to be much more resilient and resistant to further outbreaks and spreads.
That will be able to be kept localized.
It will require continued actions in different places and quick responses, but part of getting through this wave in a rapid way will be because we are developing the tools that will also help us when those waves coming forward in the coming months.


[voice of interpreter] what we are seeing is that even if we come through the current wave we will not be able to return to normality the way it was before until there isa vaccine.
and that could take a year or year and a half, we don't know, but we hope it will come sooner.
But our ability as a society andthe ability of our system to respond to these small waves andthese small challenges that we'll face with these more localized outbreaks with better tools will allow us to start up economic activity again, but we will have to remain vigilant in the year to come.



Thank you.
The next question, Laura forest, politico.



**Reporter**:

Thank you, Prime Minister.
Today obviously there has been allot of grim announcements that people have had to take in in terms of jobs numbers and projections.
They're getting the information as they're heading into a holiday weekend when they're asked not to celebrate with their families.
I'm just wondering how you thinkcanadians should react to this today?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I think obviously this is difficult news.
This is news that reflects particularly in the job numbers a reality that millions of Canadians have been feeling over the past weeks.
That the real impact on not just our economy but on the lives of Canadians, families, workers, communities, is significant and real.
But what we're also seeing in numbers from different parts of the country is that there is a light at the end of this tunnel.
That if we keep doing the things that we're doing the way we're doing, as we've seen in other countries, we're able to minimize the level of the impact of this wave of COVID-19. We are, unfortunately, going to continue to lose people across this country in the coming weeks, but we also know that there are things that we can continue to do to make sure we get through this first wave as quickly and as low-impactly as possible.
That is why as we gather with the immediate family members that we're sharing a home with right now, as we facetime to ourloved ones and reflect through this easter weekend, we need to know that we will continue, we can continue to do what is necessary for the coming weeks and months to get through this first wave in the right way, so we can get back to being there for each other in the coming year.



**Announcer**:

Follow-up.



**Reporter**:

Yes, thank you.
Dr. Njoo said he was going to be celebrating this weekend virtually with his family, how are you celebrating?



I'm hoping to see My family this weekend.
Of course, the priority is ensuring that we're getting the legislation passed.
Conversations are still ongoing with members of the opposition parties.
We know that we need to pass this legislation to get the help to people that is needed.
That is why while we continue discussions around democratic processes and defending our institutions, which will be ongoing, which is really important to me and all of us, we need to move forward on getting this legislation moving through the house so we can get the help out to Canadians.
That is My focus this weekend.
[voice of interpreter] I hope to be able to spend time with My family this weekend, but the reality isthat our priority is to get thislegislation passed so that we can help even more Canadians andget that aid out to workers and businesses.
and that's why we are in discussions with the opposition parties.
Of course, we need to ensure that our democracy continues to work and that our strong institutions are there for us inthese difficult times, but we must absolutely bring back the house of commons to pass this bill so that we can help people.
I do hope that the opposition parties will agree with me in saying that Canadians cannot wait.



Thank you.




**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
With respect to that bill, we understand that the conservatives are saying that parliament will have to meet in person, in reduced numbers.
That is the condition for their agreeing.
Now why is this their condition?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

First of all, we're very open and we're prepared to recall parliament to pass important legislation and do the job that people expect us to do as a government and as a parliament.
But we also know that we must follow the recommendations of health care experts and not assemble people if it's not absolutely necessary.
There are virtual means available and even if we meet in reduced numbers, there are security officials and other people who will be there and must be there to help us. But we want to minimize any impact.
and, of course, we want to continue to seek ways to work together and ensure that we can keep our strong democracy and our strong institutions working.
We're very open to that, but I think we're in a time now where we should not be preventing the passage of important legislation just because you want to keep talking.
So those discussions will have to continue.



**Reporter**:

With respect -- --



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I'll answer in English.
It's important we have strong democrat we can institutions that continue to function and serve Canadians to get the help needed to Canadians and provide that input from voices across the country on the impact that things are having in their community.
That is essential.
and we're going to continue to talk with opposition parties about how we can make sure that our institutions and parliament continues to function.
It is something to remember when we do gather in smaller numbers, first of all, it's still requires a significant number of support staff to come into work, to be there while parliament is functioning and that puts them at risk as well.
But it's also something that doesn't allow for members of parliament who live in further parts of the country to be weighing in and make sure that their communities are being heard.
That's why we're so interested in looking for virtual ways of gathering the house and we're going to continue to work on that.
But I think it's really important that parliamentarians get together to make sure that the work of getting the help to Canadians happens, and happens quickly, while these continued conversations about furthering our democracy in this moment of crisis continue.
It's not the time to further delay getting help to Canadians.



mr. Scheer is saying that -- problem in any case -- the infrastructure to get that subsidy out there is not ready and it couldn't be given to themright away anyway.
So do you consider that the conservatives are responsible orare you responsible, because you're unwilling to make a compromise?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:



[voiceof interpreter] I'm a little disconcerted by that comment if Mr. Scheer actually said that.
Because we believe that debate and discussions in the house of commons are often a place where we see the impact and we can adjust our legislation to get even better outcomes.
I don't think any party, even a party that is in government, knows everything that is going on in every circumstance.
and the federal government has an important role and the opposition also has an importantrole in improving legislation, even in the midst of an emergency.
So for me, recalling parliament is not just getting them to, youknow, give their stamp of approval, no, it's because we have an opportunity to debate and do the right thing for Canadians.
and if that is what Mr. Scheer said, I'm a little disappointed in his lack of understanding of the importance of informed debate in parliament when looking at legislation.


[end of translation]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

If indeed, Mr. Scheer suggested that the debate had by parliamentarians around a given piece of legislation don't really have impact, I choose to disagree.
I think it's really important that we hear voices from every corner of the country on the potential impacts or potential improvements to the bill we're putting forward.
I think that's how parliament is supposed to work and that's how Canadians consider the parliament is supposed to work, so I very much look forward to the debate on our wage subsidy to see how it's going to impact, and hear from every corner of the country as much as we can on how we can make sure that it's doing the right things for Canadians.
Parliament matters.
The debate that happens in parliament matters.
You can't just shrug it off like rubber stamp that doesn't matter because I know how deeply it matters that we have proper and robust debate on this.



David thurton, CBC news.



**Reporter**:

Documents show that the government has been preparing for a pandemic since -- over a decade, since the outbreak of SARS.
But we're seeing now that, you know, it seems that the government has been caught off guard and Canadians are paying the price for that.
What went wrong in the planning?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We've seen countries around the world caught off guard by the nature of this epidemic.
The challenges we face in terms of getting Canadians protected are echoed around the world.
Some countries are handling it better than others.
Canada has done a good job of keeping on a path that is going to minimize as much as possible the reality we're in right now.
and that's why we need to continue to do the things we're doing, staying home, contact-tracing, aggressive testing.
and why we need to continue to listen to experts on other things we need to do to ensure we're having the minimal possible impact on Canadians.
Of course, there will be lots oflessons learned from this, as there were lessons learned from sars and we're going to learn them and bring them into play.



**Reporter**:

What went wrong in the government's planning?



I think we all know this was a situation we're adjusting as best we can to. We took the advice of experts.
We moved forward in significant ways.
As we look back at the end of this, I'm sure people will say you could have done this a few days before, or maybe you did this too quickly, you could have taken a few more days to reflect on it. Every step of the way we make the best decisions we can given the information we have.
If it's not exactly right, we fix it and try to get it better as we move forward.
I think that's what Canadians expect.



Hi, Prime Minister.
National news.
You're government says they're negotiating with the opposition right now.
Can you help Canadians understand what is the holdup to recalling parliament? this wage subsidy is sitting on the table.
There are businesses we're talking to on the brink of bankruptcy here.
What is the holdup right now?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

My understanding is that the legislation itself is largely seen as the right solution by other parties.
They may have little tweaks and improvements to make and we look forward to working with them on suggestions or amendments that they have, but there seems to Beau sense from the official opposition that this is a moment to define or determine how parliament will function in the coming weeks and they are negotiating around the structures.
We've said we're, of course, happy to have these conversations.
We've put forward proposals around things we think could work to both minimize the risk to Canadians while moving towards a virtual parliament.
and ensuring that the debate and accountability that is so important in our democracy.
and we hope that the official opposition will choose to realize that we need to pass this legislation quickly to get the help out to Canadians as quickly as possible.


[voice of interpreter] My understanding isthat the bill, per se, has the general support of the opposition parties.
They recognize that it's important and they may want to propose certain amendments and we're certainly open to that, but the official opposition is insisting that this is a time todetermine what parliament shouldlook like in the coming weeks and bringing in very strong measures.
and, of course, we're open to talking about this, but we believe this should be done in parallel with the normal legislative process because the bill needs to pass as quickly aspossible in order to help Canadians.



**Reporter**:

You talked about Canada having fiscal fire power.
The government was planning for months of uncertainty, emergencyfunding, how long of a financial rope do we have here? and should we be rationing that emergency funding knowing that we're in for a year here of self-isolation on and off?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We made the decision early on that we needed to be aggressive and broad in getting help out to Canadians.
and that's what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.
and we moved very, very quickly and we are continuing to fill gaps and look at areas where we can do more to help Canadians.
We'll continue to do that.
But we knew that our best chance of rebounding from this strongly and getting back to the extraordinary successful economy and country we've had, that we've built over so many generations, is to ensure that the Canadians are supported through this however long it takes.
Now we are extremely hopeful that we will be able to begin to restore a certain measure of economic activity in the coming months after this first wave haspassed, but we will make sure that every step of the way we'regiving Canadians the support they need to be able to keep themselves safe, to do what is necessary to keep us all safe and to ensure that as we get going again, Canada continues to be successful for all Canadians.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:



[voiceof interpreter] we recognize that we had to bring in broad measures quickly to help as manypeople as possible and that's what we did with the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.
and we will continue to do whatever is necessary as long asit is necessary.
We hope it will only take a few months for this first wave and that will allow us to start getting things back on track economically, getting people back to work with additional measures so that we can continueto succeed as a country, but whatever time it takes, we will always be there to support the Canadians who need help.



Radio-Canada.



**Reporter**:

You say it may take year or year and a half before we return to normal.
Does that mean a year or year and a half before kids go back to school or people go back to work, or we can go to a park with our family or attend concerts? is that what you're telling us? is that the normal you're referring to.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

What I'm saying is until there is a vaccine available, the reality of COVID-19 will still be with us. So for the months that will take and there are some estimates that say six or eight months, some say a year, year and a half, we will have to be vigilant.
We will have to have measures followed as part of our normal life and at the same time we'll have to have measures ready to introduce if there is a resurgence of the virus in certain areas of the country or under certain conditions.
But once we come through that first wave, we want to be able to allow some economic activity to start up again and that is why there will be a graduated return to normal economic activity compared to now.
But I think it's important that people understand we'll have to be vigilant for a year or a yea rand a half.
There are things that we will not be able to do, but there will be more things we will be able to do and that is if and only if we come through the next few weeks and months properly.
and that is why we are going to have to remain in this current phase for some time.



**Reporter**:

Do you think that the level of tolerance of Canadians is where exactly? how long can they stay in this confinement? there are some people who are isolated who don't have any doctors.
Some people are not there for them.
The government is not there to help them.
What do you say to those communities that need help now?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, we have seen difficult things happen in the past.
When we think of generations of Canadians who have made sacrifices in the major wars including vi my 100 years ago, but there are Canadians across the country that have made sacrifices for many years in order to build the country that we have today.
I know it's difficult, what we're doing now and what we're experiencing, and that's why the government is there to help vulnerable Canadians, to help people who are losing their jobs, to help people that need to support their families.
and particularly, to help and protect our front-line workers whether it's in the health care system or our grocery stores.
These people ensure that we'll be able to come through this andmeet this challenge the right way.
So we will continue to be there for each other.
We will continue to lean on eachother and we will come through this because we're strong Canadians and as a country.
Now with respect to the indigenous people, we're very concerned and we have been very concerned from the outset about the vulnerability of those communities and that's why we have made investments, we made investments right away to improve the resilience of those communities, but we know there are is still a lot to be done and there have been a few cases in certain communities which is very much a concern and we're working very seriously on this.



**Reporter**:

is Canada looking at the same to support our oil and gas industry and if not, what is the government going to do to support the industry?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I can tell you that the minister of natural resources, sea mus o'regan, is closely coordinating with his counterpart secretary of energy in the United States.
We recognize that the north American market and oil production sector needs to stand together on this.
We're working very closely with our counterparts and our NAFTA partners to ensure that we have a strong and united front in dealing with this global situation.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, "globe and mail", My colleagues wrote about the fact that ottawahad a playbook for a pandemic 14years ago, co-authorized by Dr. Tam and subsequent audits flagged problems with the stockpile of medical equipment.
You said a few moments ago you were caught off guard, but givenall the preparedness done here, going back to 2006 and having enough medical supplies in the stockpile coming up short, what will your government do to fix that?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We've seen and spoke a number of times in the early days of this pandemic how there were significant lessons we learned from that SARS epidemic.
There were things done or not done in 2003 that led to significant changes in our approach on public health.
and Canada was better positionedthen, a number of countries around the world, to respond to this pandemic because we had had and learned from the experience of SARS.
Similarly, as we go through thistime, we will learn more things about how to be even better prepared next time if this ever happens again, as it is likely that it will in the coming decades.
We need to make sure that we have the tools necessary to keepcanadians safe and that is something that keeps evolving every single day.
We will listen to science.
We will share the best recommendations with Canadians.
We will lean on each other and we will get through this together.
It's what we do as a country.



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada giving his daily COVID-19 briefing and returning to his home.
Probably the clearest and starkest message we've heard from the Prime Minister to date about how long we're going to be in this and how long we're going to have to contend with these strict public health measures.
The Prime Minister saying that this is "the new normal" until there is a vaccine, suggesting as well that there will be some of these measures that will need to be in place for many, many months.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos andcatherine Cullen.
So, a tough message probably for everybody to hear that this is not -- even we get past the first wave this summer, this is not something that is going to end quickly, soon or easily.
and listen, I didn't love hearing that either, but it is important that people recognize the time length here.
It is the question that the mostcanadians had, how long is this go to go, and the prime minister was blunt today for the first time.



**Vassy**:

It almost felt like ripping the band-aid off, right? I think you're right to say it doesn't feel good to hear what we heard today but it builds very much on what we heard from Dr. Theresa tam and Dr. Howard Njoo.
There is data to underscore the point that by the summer we may be able to say that the first wave, the most severe wave of this epidemic is over, but really, until there is a vaccine, the only way we can contend -- and you pointed this out, rosie -- the only way to fight back against the spread ofthe virus is to practise these physical distancing measures, tosee businesses shut down, the economy slowed so much.
That is really the only tool we have at our disposal.
and that was underscored by boththe public health officials and the Prime Minister.
I would point out just one thingi noticed he said near the end of the press conference and it was in french, but he did talk about the desire on his behalf and the federal government's behalf to lift some of the economic restrictions, right? and after that first wave.
and that is something that we also heard from public health officials just sort of this ideaof, okay, once the first wave isover, if it does in fact end by the summer or sometime in the summer, what does that then meanfor the economy or for the restrictions that have been placed on us? and it sounds like there is a desire on the part of the federal government to ease some of the restrictions, but again, that is going to depend -- and this is what the public health officials kept saying -- on the province you live in and how theepidemic is faring there as wellas the measures that they have in place to sort of contain the second wave, or the third wave.
and I'm talking now about testing or surveillance.
I think there are a lot of questions for provincial and federal government how they intend to tackle the first post wave period.
As your last guest pointed out, there is intersection between the public health act and the economic.
We're seeing a staggering numberof job losses in March.
How long can people sustain the economic damage that has been infliblthed on them -- inflictedon them, and on us and at what point is it too difficult to maintain the physical distancingmeasures that are so necessary in order to slow the spread of the virus? I think there are very valid questions now that we have all this information.
Important questions for the government going ahead.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you so much.
Catherine, I'll talk to new a moment.
Before I want to say goodbye to viewers on the CBC main network.

**Rosemary**:

The pressure Putin the economy to loosen healthmeasures, but less that the prime but also that the prime ministertthe new timeline, living likethis, and Canadians resilience to sticking to these measures, as well.
I know there's jokes about people that it's not that hard to stay on your couch but it is asking a lot to restrict your interactions with others.



You new normal, which I think will be the big take away from today when we look at the timespan.
I want to grab on to the idea of how long can the canadiangovernment sustain this financial support? what are you prepared to do? I think one colleague phrasedit, how much rope do you have and listen, we'll be there as long need to be there?



**Rosemary**:

It's important tothere'sthe direct support of caswho have lost their jobs but there are other effects in terms of businesses of all sizes, small and medium-sizedbusinesses.
Some businesses may be able tosustain themselves but thelonger this goes on, the longerthe economic impact on thatfront and the questions aboutwhat sorts of jobs willavailable for people to comeback to. The Prime Minister was trying toencouraging and he said at onepoint, when the economy comingroars back, but it was a verysobering message today, I think.
He talked about wavelets, smaller waves afterwards and wewant to juxtapose that saying itcould ignite another problem, sothe whole balancing act on andeconomic front on top of themore personal morale questions.
Some of this is being asked thatpeople know they'll get tired, if they aren't already, ofstaying in their homes but thestakes are so incredibly high.



**Rosemary**:

The reason this is being said today, the reason the modeling put forward, the things the Prime Minister said is about saving lives and how manypeople's lives can be saved depending on the rate of infection and we got that today, if it's 2.5%, which it is notnot, there are 11, 000 canadianswho will die and it will put, asdr.
Tam said, an enormous amount of pressure on the healthcaresystem.
I think, as you say, the Prime Minister was trying to be encouraging for all of us to stick with this.
I have had a couple of question son Twitter, about the upcomingweekend, a celebration ofpassover, either and I knowramadan is to come.
When public health officials say stayed within your immediatefamily, they mean the people you live with.
They don't mean your aunts and uncles who live in other places or parents or grandparents.
They mean the home you live in and those are the people you can celebrate with and nobody else unless you face-time or zoom orhowever you want to celebrate.
But I think that's important toremind people as we move forwardthat is the best advice.



**Reporter**:

Talking aboutdr.
Njoo and his own children, thinking of your immediatefamily.
He said he has family inmontreal and will be speaking to them only virtually.



**Rosemary**:

I'll go to peterarmstrong and come back.
Obviously, the state of thecanadian economy is under an extreme strain because it has essentially been put on pause until these public health measures can contain the pandemic and our senior business correspondent joins us for mo reanalysis on that.
So obviously, peter, we knew the job numbers were not going to begood, but it's one thing to know it and another thing to see it.



**Reporter**:

It is, and it'sanother thing to really recognise that this is just thebeginning, that this was in the field March 15th to the 21st, at the very front-end ofthe layoffs.
and the headline is bad.
a million job's loss is eighttimes worse than the job's losswe saw back in 2009.
But you get into the detail ofhow many people have lost asignificant or a majority, thehours that they were working andyou and in 2.1 million canadiansand you're looking at 3 millioncanadians that lost their job ormajority of hours they wereworking and who is being impact.
You and I have talked about thisbefore, 66% of us make less thanof $66, 000 a year.
You're looking at truck driversand retail sales, thoselower-income Canadians aregetting the hardest hit and someare out at the front-end doingthe hardest work, groceries andpharmacy and putting themselveson the line to provide essentialservices that we all have.
But the numbers are ugly andthis does set us up for anuglier report if April and howlong will this last.
Even once they lift thelockdown, when will you go to amovie theatre again or get on toa plane and fly with all thesepeople? how quickly will consumers getthemselves back into the economysome.



**Rosemary**:

Lots of question sand peter, I will leave you because federal officials are starting their briefing andwe'll hear more from peter throughout the day as staggering job numbers sink in. Let's go to the federal ministers and this is the deputy prime Minister chrystiafreeland.
We know that many Canadians are experiencing great difficulties because of COVID-19. Some are not covered by the wage subsidy or the CERB.
We are working very hard to find ways to help them.
Today statistics Canada released the latest employment numbers.
These figures represent more than one million Canadians and more than one million canadianfamilies who are experiencing great hardship and who are really afraid.
To all of you, let me say, we'rehear for you.
If you haven't already applied for the CERB, please do so. It is there for you.
I would also like to urge allcanadian employers if they canto follow the example of those companies that have reviewed the wage subsidy commitment and have decided to hire back many people they had laid off.
The wage subsidy will beretroactive.
We are working very hard to get it through parliament.
If you can, please use the wage subsidy to be sure that as manycanadians as possible can keep their jobs.
We also know that there are manycanadians in real trouble right now because of COVID-19. Some are not covered by the wage subsidy or by CERB.
We are working hard to find ways to support you, too.
Ok. so today, we will hear fromcanada's chief public healthofficer, Dr. Theresa tam and Dr. and also, the Minister of heal this hear to answer yourquestions, too.
Dr. Tam, please.



Hello, everyone, I thought an update on the numbers ofcovid-19 in Canada.
There are 19, 774 cases, including 461 deaths.
Again, these numbers are changing are speaking as we speak as provinces provideupdates.
In terms of lab testing, over373, 000 people with now over 5%confirmed positive.
As Canada continues to improve testing to track where the disease is spreading.
Of course, when I wrote the speech last night, I started the next paragraph with the weather warming and so anyone who has looked outside the window inottawa or looked at the weatherforecast, that is not the case right now but the holidays are almost upon us and I want to reiterate how important it is for us to maintain our resolve to plank the curve.
So far, the efforts of allcanadians are making difference from healthcare providers saving lives on the front lines to public health and lab professionals testing and tracing COVID-19 spread, to essential service workers keeping our hospitals and our homes stocked and every canadianwho is staying at home.
I recognised that these change sand our daily lives that we are asking people to make an extremely difficult.
Despite hardships, we are all in this together.
The Canadian effort allowing to slow the spread are protecting health services for everyone.
So during important religiousobservances, includes Passover, Easter and Ramadan, we need to not let down our guard.
That means dinners and celebrations need to be strictly limited to your existing household members only and the safest plan for your holidays ISS stay cation for the nation.
Make arrangements to connect over phone and video chat.
We need to keep physically apart but virtually together.
Connecting has never been soimportant, so please support each other.
Thank you.



and now, Dr. Njoo, you have the floor.
Please go ahead.



Thank you.
Good afternoon, first of all, the number of cases of COVID-19in Canada is 19, 417 cases in thecountry, including 461 deaths.
For the lab testing, we'vecompleted tests for over 373, 000people and now 5% are confirmedpositive.
As Canada continues to improvetesting to track where thedisease is spreading.
With the weather warming, eventhough it's snowing in ottawaand holidays are upon us, wewish to stress how important isto maintain our reserve.
So far Canadians are making adifference from healthcareproviders saving lives on thefront lines to public health andlab professionals, testing testdtracing the virus, everycanadian who is staying at home, despite the hardships must becontinued.
We are all in this together.
Canadians collective efforts toslow the spread of this virushas allowed our health system tocope.
and that means we're protectinghealth services for everyone.
That's why during importantreligious services, we must notlet down our guard.
That means dinners andcelebrations need to be strictlylimited to your existinghousehold members own only.
During these few holidays, wemust protect ourselves bystaying home and only contactingpeople by phone, email and videochat.
We need to protect each otherand that is best done by keepingphysically apart.
But virtuallytogether.
Connecting has never been soimportant.
We must support each other andwe must do that.
and now, I give the floor to thepresident of our treasury board.
Please go ahead.



This morning, presidenttrudeau gave us a message of hope and courage and one mentioned the 102nd anniversary of the vimyridge battle in 1918.
This is a message that particularly resonates in quebecbecause the 22nd regiment, which is an institution inquebec that corrected significantly to the effortingsand we remembered theircommitment, their courage, the sacrifice they made for our country and I think that helps us and inspires and guides news what we must do today.
Secondly, I wanted to give you quick update as to the applications we've received.
a total of 750, 000 options we remade for the CERB benefit which brings us up to 5 million in all since March 15th.
Of that 5 million, 4.6 million were already processed which is excellent news for the millions of Canadians that find themselves experiencing hardshiptoday.
and are feeling anxious and secure.
In closing, for those canadiansborn in October, November anddecember, today is the day that you should file your application for the Canadian emergency relief benefit.
On Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Thank you.



Thank you, and now we are all here to answer your questions.
We will begin with three questions on the telephone.



Thank you.



We will now take questions from the telephone lines.

---

**Question**:

My question foryou, miss Freeland, we now understand that it will be months before life returns tonormal.
The wave subsidy is for three months and we learned air canadawill be benefiting from that and definitely not an industry returning to normal in threemonths.
I was wondering if you we rethinking of be causes to distribute the money in different way than just giving it to everyone who asks for it, given that all industries do not find themselves in the samecircumstances.
As Dr. Tam said, we do understand the situation will be difficult for more than a month, more than two months.
and we must be prepared.
Also, as Dr. Tam said, we don'tknow exactly when the situation is going to come to an end and when it will be possible forcanadians to return to work.
What the government has already done and what the government will continue to do is to be there for Canadians, for worker sand for businesses.
We understand that this economic shock was not caused by economic process use themselves.
It's an external shock which is why it's a duty for the government to support canadiansand workers and businesses.
For as long necessary.
The good news is that our government and our economy at the beginning of this crisis were in good shape.
Canada and the federal government have the fiscal resources necessary to do all that is required to protectcanadians during this crisis.
As for the length of time this will last, no one can say today how long these measures will be necessary to shore up oureconomy.
The only thing we can tell you is that we are ready to do everything that's required.
We have set up necessary measures today and we did so very quickly.
As was just said, the CERB is there today and helping manycanadians.
We could not move as quickly with the wage subsidy.
With respect to the future, the only thing I can tell you is that it's important that we will be prepared to support thecanadian economy.
Thank you a follow-up question, if I may ask you.
The logic of support offered to the airline industry thatclearly will not recover overthe next three months from this, wouldn't that money be of betteruse elsewhere? answer, I think it's importantfor all of us to understand thatno one can come up with certainpredictions of the future.
Dr. Tam was quite clear thismorning when she explained theprognosis with the progress ofthe coronavirus.
Because of this greatuncertainty, what we must do isprecisely what we did do and aredoing, which is providing thenecessary support to our economyand I would like to assurecanadians that we will continueto support our economy for aslong it's necessary to do so. It's very important for us notto net the coronavirus damageour economy.
We are taking the necessarysteps now to protect canadian'shealth and lives, but we knowquite well that those necessarysteps will have a seriouseconomic impact, as well.
The government's work and dutyis to protect the economy duringthat period.
That is what we are doing nowand we shall continue to do so. We will protect Canada'seconomic capacity and we mustprotect canadian's lives.
and that is what we willcontinue to do. I will close by saying thatcanada and the federalgovernment has the economicresources necessary to do so.



Thank you, next question on the phone.



Our next question is from thecanadian press.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi, this is question probably for Dr. Tam.
Given the modeling that you released this morning for for the better understanding of how you see COVID-19 unfolding incanada, are you recommending that government enact stricter measures for businesses and ifso, what additional measures should be considered?



Yes, so we do have been monitoring closely on a daily basis and I think we recognise that we need to try to ascertain how to measure the effectness of our public health measure.
So the studies might be quiteinnovative.
For example, just tracking mobility of the population and the data that people have seen being published as we speak and that tells us a little bit more how well Canadians are doing with some of these recommendations and where we can strengthen thoserecommendations.
I think we know that some areas of social distancing has really been reduced in terms of no one is gathering, really.
There's no mass gathering of anysize.
We're just trying to strengthen the message to Canadians that really you should avoid all nonessential travel and stay at home as much as possible during this critical period.
I think that behavioral scientists are studying thesephenomenon, as well, andingurgingpeople to do better.
We know contact tracing is key to staying on the trajectory toimprove.
I talked about the fact that on the one hand, you can try to support people in self-isolationand in quarantine, making surethey have the right environmentto do so safely.
and if they don't have theconditions at home to do that, to support them, maybe housingin a different space.
On the other hand, you've seenjurisdictions come with moremeasures on the compliance andenforcement side to try to ensure that all Canadians knowhow serious this situation isand that we want them to takethings seriously.
So tightening up on making surepeople who are sick stay at homeand any close contacts alsoself-isolate is really, reallyimportant.
So I can't stress that enough.
As I've said, we do continue to have a improve the laboratorytesting to protect the caseswhich is absolutely important tomaintain this trajectory and putthis epidemic first wave to aclose.
and it's not any different towhat we've been recommending allalong, but we would at somepoint, I think, as we are comingdown the other side of theepidemic curve, we would like tolook at different ways tomeasure the impact and success, both positive and also negativeimpacts of our measures, as well.
So that we can recalibrate as wesort of move ahead, but forsure, cases in contact tracingand social distancing stillremain key.



Thank you, doctor.
Follow-up?



Yeah, I'm just wondering, allot of Canadians are watching the United States and what is going on there.
How dependent is our best-casescenario and how the United States does?



Even within Canada we have significant regional difference sand so we are different fromwhat's happening in the United States in terms of theirepidemiology.
and we want to better stay in the epidemic control curve that presented today.
So we'll be doing everything we can.
I think the measures that we'veput in place and the ministers may want to comment on that, too, is really restrictingtravel, essential travel, and ensuring that those essential services continue, but really cutting down on the amount of travel between the two countries to those essential travel will remain very key and again, we can't adjust any of that untilwe've seen not just what happens within the Canadian context, but definitely what's happening on the other side of the border.



Today was our weekly call with My counterparts at the g7. The health ministers meet to talk about what's been working and the struggles that we have having collectively as country.
One thing acknowledged by all partners was that there needs to be a global effort to eliminatecovid-19. That this can't be -- Canada'sproblem will not be resolved until all countries have strong measures both on the suppression of COVID-19 but also on thelong-term treatment andprevention of COVID-19 in all of our populations.
and that was recognised by allhealth ministers on that call.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
Next question, please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Good afternoon.
I would like to come back to the scenarios that were presented to us this morning.
It's not clear in My mind exactly what in your mind is the most probable scenario.
Your charts seem to show 2.5% to5%for a number of deaths, butthere's a 10% rate that produce44, 000 deaths mentioned bymr.
Trudeau this morning.
I understand you don't have acrystal ball.
But in your opinion, what is themost probable projection.



Thank you for the question.
This is Dr. Njoo.
As we said this morning, we are continuing all Canadians, all levels of government, our healthcare assistance programs continuing all efforts to flatten the curve.
So that means that we expect to continue to see in the future a1% of the entire canadianpopulation.
It's not over one month, but several months, perhaps a year or more even.
So if one calculates that over37 million people, we expect to see about 376, 000 cases.
But that's not the only concern.
We must remember that we're just at the beginning of the epidemichere.
We need to watch how the epidemic is moving in all areas of the country, in all of the provinces and territories and soit's difficult to forecast exactly when we'll arrive at the peak of the wave.
Right now, we're just at the beginning of it. and we won't know we've arrived at the peak until we're already starting to go down.
So everyone's priority now is really deploying all efforts at physical distancing and we will see from one week to the next what happens.



In terms of where we're at, certainly from all of the bestefforts, all Canadians including all of the government and also, obviously, that the public health and healthcare system, we're looking at what we call abest-case scenario, 1% attackrate in the whole canadianpopulation and the simplearithmetic, looking at thecanadian population of 37 plusmillion, obviously that wouldtranslate to 376, 000 cases butthe 376, 000 cases, we certainlydon't expect to it happenovernight.
We expect it to happen over manymonths, even a year or so. Look at where we're at today.
We're at about 20, 000 cases now.
So we still have a ways to goand having said that, it's alsodifficult to predict exactlywhen will get to our peakbecause you won't know whenyou're at the peak until you'reon the downward curve and itremains to be seen what happensover the coming weeks andmonths.
But for the moment, in terms ofwhat we're doing, I think we can't let go of our publichealth measures.
Everyone is doing their best interms of physical distancing andi think we have to watch week byweek how we're doing as acountry.



and as a follow-up, I can askdr.
Tam, should I understandfrom what's being said that the1% scenario is the one we areworking on right now ifeverything remains the same? I understand we can't predictthe future, but right now, you're saying that the mostprobable scenario is the 1% one?



I wouldn't say the mostprobable, but we don't know thatyet.
I would say that's theaspirational and our goal we provided in terms of the briefing today and everything that we can do now will reduce that infectious rate and as short of a time as possible.
We call this our ambition, because we have to check to see how much of the population isinfected.
Some of that kind of work as we work through this first wave, we're looking at what tests would help us to determine how much of the population in the end of that first wave has actually been infected.
So this is some of the data that still needs to be gathered.



Thank you, we'll turn to the room now and Mary Kay Walsh from the "globe and mail."

---

**Question**:

Still on themodeling, we spoke with one epidemic who said your models appear overly optimistic and your best case scenario curve does not show the subsequent curves and it may be faulty.
If we have everybody onlockdown, unless they leavelockdown with a vaccine, there will be more spikes.



So this is a novel virus for which the population is notimmune.
So it's true that if after the first wave and we did really, really well, only a small proportion is, in fact have encountered this virus, we are in for a significant period of time where we would expect that public health measures to some extent will still be applied.
To me, it will be a new normal.
We have to be careful how to release the public healthmeasure.
Because the public is not immune and we've seen a blip after the first wave, I think these are scenario planning.
What we want to do is to make sure that any subsequent wave stays below the capacity of the health system to be able to cope and so that's the concept of those scenarios.
But those little waves could continue to occur for a number of months until either, say, vaccine is discovered or the majority of the population is immune in some way.
But we can't go too far into the distant future in estimations because the virus could change.
We don't even know if you'reimmune today, how long that immunity will last for and so by all means, we're not saying thescenarios, exactly what willhappen.
This is an estimate and these can be adjusted.
But whoever that person is is entirely correct.
We have a long ways to go in the whole trajectory of thispandemic.



Thank you.
and Minister hadju, on my colleagues reporting on the 2006pandemic report and what it foretold and what we're nowexperiencing, I'm wondering if you regret that Canada was not better prepared and that canadadid not have what appeared to be sufficient stockpiles and things like wide-spread testing werenot put into place early enough.



I'll answer generally and turn to Dr. Tam.
But I want to thank the excellent leadership of the public health officials guiding us through this since the emergence of the brand new virus since early January.
Dr. Tam used the epidemic plan as a guidance document to stand up the organizations that leadto, for example, the public health officials from all across the province and territories meeting on a regular basis very early on. In terms of the nationalstockpile, of course, always more could be done to prepare in terms of epidemics.
I will remind you that province sand territories have stockpilesand, of course, the work we'redoing collaboratively right no won ensuring the front-linehealthcare workers have what we need is critically important.
I will also say that in terms ofanticipating the behaviour ofthe virus, I think Dr. Tam hasrepeated this a number of timesand I think it bears repeating.
This is a brand new virus.
If we had testing capacity, soto speak, what kind of tests andthose had to be developed oncewe received the genetic sequencefrom china in the early days.
I want to again reiterate ourthanks to the leadership of thepublic health officials guidingus through that.
Certainly we're grateful fortheir expertise and involvementin determining our response.



Did you want to speak a bit about the early testing and the challenges around that?



So I think Canada is country that has done pandemic planning for longer than any other country in the world and we have a strong history of doing that.
That particular plan in 2006came out just after SARS.
We actually experienced another pandemic in that in 2009.
That lead to an evergreen plan, which you can fine on ourwebsite.
The lesson learned from 2009 is to be able to flexibly andscalably amount a response.
You can't tell what the next pandemic might be like.
So it's taking a risk managementapproach.
Instead of those specific phases that we had in 2006, we moved onto a much more flexibleresponse.
and based on My experience, asi've always said, when you'veseen one pandemic, you've see none pandemic.
In fact, the best thing to do is throw out all of the previous assumptions because they'relikely to be wrong.
We do have much better talks than before.
Those genetic sequencing done in great time has allowed Canada to develop the OCR test really, really fast.
I'm actually quite happy with the fact that there's a network of public health labs.
We decentralized -- unlike somecountries, we decentralized fa stand it ensured the provisional labs picking up the ability todo so and now distributing the laboratory testing down theline, as well, and we are pursuing other tests.
So I would essentially put it to all Canadians that we were one of the fastest countries in the world to establish good laboratory capacity.
Could we do more? sure.
I would like to explain the national stockpile.
As we all know, the healthcare system is in the jurisdiction of the province and territories and they do have supply management and they use a lot of resource son a daily basis.
At the federal level, we are much more strategic in what we have in that stockpile andthat's deliberate.
We moved from the cold-war modelof what the national emergencystockpile looked like at thetime to one that is highlyspecialized.
In it is the country's onlystockpile of certain specificcounter measures like thesmallpox vaccine that no oneelse has.
That's the role of the federalstockpile.
We have smaller surgecapacities, but it was neverdesigned to back up the wholehealth system in Canada.
What we do is to get with otherdepartments to put together themechanisms needed to pulltogether the infrastructure.
We had a massive role inpandemic vaccine infrastructurebuilding and putting one of theworld's first vaccine contracts in the world.
and we're striving to be asearly as possible in a globalleader in vaccine developmentsand also ensuring that we lookahead to that day when we dohave vaccine candidates that, ttwe're this the best position forthat.
That's some of what we're doingand you've seen multiplegovernment responses looking to get any supply that we can.
We're in a global supplyshortage situation for almosteverything we need.
So I can certainly attest to thefact that everybody is pullingout all stops and that is partof our role, is not just tostockpile stuff in a lot ofplaces but to pull together themechanisms so there's access.



Thank you, Dr. McKenzie.
On March 21st, we closed the border for the entirely world and stopped United States citizens from coming in that day.
From the models we saw today, how much did closing the border impact the ability to blank the curve and on this same issue, miss Freeland, the Prime Minister said that we won't see normalcy in our lives until there is a vaccine.
So can we conclude that the border will not be reopened until we have a vaccine?



So I well recall that particular week in March where almost everything happened, not just the border measures that the federal government played Key role in and the traveladvisories, but also everything else like reducing mass gatherings and much has been done by the province and territories within about that same time frame, which is whywe're saying that these coming weeks are critical because we systematically escalated all of those measures around that time period so teasing out the exact contribution of everything one of those components may not Bethe easiest.
What I will say is the wholeworld, global traffic also went down at the same time and we do know that if we looked at ourcases, the contribution of travelers as being casesdeminimumming over time.
Diminish over time.



So the Prime Minister did, indeed, explain has Dr. Tam has done that we need a vaccine to really be through this.
In terms of what that reality means about the border, we justcan't say today and it would be full hardy in the extreme to make predicts about what border measures will be. Having said that, we have taken really meaningful measures at the border including the land border with the United States.
We have introduced mandatory quarantine for everyone coming into Canada wherever they begin their journey and we have been introducing increasingly effective ways of enforcing thatquarantine.
All of those measures are really necessary and they are helping us to protect the health and safety of Canadians.



If I just might add.
I think is a question all countries are facing, as they try to retain their own transmission and the question is how to manage the importation ofquestions.
I would echo Minister freelandand Dr. Tam, that that isunknown.
But we are studying countries ahead of us on the co us in, on the downward slope, if you will, looking at how to contain the bumps of transmission very carefully so that we can learn from their experiences andcertainly, if there's any silver lining is that we are early on our journey in terms of the rise of the curve to look at the experiences of other countries st hat have experienced that peak more recently.



Dr. Tam, everyone is in agreement that tests is a core component to figure this out.
We have spoken to a number of people and they said you should get tested for COVID-19 and they go to testing facility and theysay, we won't testing you.
Are making changes in place to the testing in Canada? the models has shown that there will be multiple waves and how will we get the multiple wave sunder control if we don't test everyone who shows symptoms?



So we are improving our laboratory capacity and I think that is ongoing at multiplefronts.
and I think after explaining in the last days where we're trying to improve on the volume and of the capacity for the pcrtesting, there's a need to get the reagents and the other components of that and we'retrying, again, like any supply, every way possible, includingdomestic, you know, domestic concoctions of the said reagents to improve capacity and we are testing a significant number of people and have maintained and good rate of testing compared to many countries in the world.
But we will continue to and look at point of care testing, as well, as the serologic testing in the future.
When we provide guidance in terms of where the priority focus might be and the people who have to be tested, including the healthcare workers, the vulnerable population, etcetera.
At the moment, our public health measures are such that mildly sick people we're advising to stay at home and some are not being tested and so we are focusing on priority groups.
As the laboratory capacity changes and different tests com eon board, and we're in different trajectory in theepidemic, then we have to increase testing as we come down the pandemic and try to detectthis, we would have to test more widely again.
and so it is a very dynamic process but we still expect our recommendations and this is behaviour change for Canadians.
If you're sick, say home.
I do think there's a role for, of course, serology, to determine the basic level in thepopulation.
There's a role, potentially, to look at how immunity works particularly in groups that are vulnerable or delivering inessential services.
So those are some of the parties going forward.
We will evaluate that as we goalong, but absolutely.
I think our lab testing capability is what all province sand territories are trying to do right now.



Thank you.

**Question**:

Thank you.
This, I think, for anyone who wants to answer it. So Canadians got bleak information today in terms of job numbers and in terms of the projections and fatalities.
Aside from the information, there's still a lot of uncertainty and questions not answered on the other side ofthis.
They're now heading into Holiday weekend being asked to stay away from their families.
I'm wondering how canadiansshould absorb this information is deal with it?



Well, first of all, I would just say that I understand thatthere's a lot of fear andthere's a lot of distress andthere's a lot of anxiety and would say that a lot of us are feeling that.
With Canadians, I think this ISS time where the uncertainty itself is difficult to manage.
Just the questions that we'rereceiving from all of you, essentially, when will this beover, I think, is the pressing question that most canadianshave, when will this be over? as I've said,. , this is a time for us to pull sand I know that fear is real but it will take the courage fro mall of us to maintain the practises that the public health as prescribed to end this situation earlier, to protect the health and the lives of our loved ones and our friend.
There are ways, personally, think, to feel better.
Personally, that's when I do things for other people.
Many people have reached out tome, by the way, and I thank allcanadians sending messages of encouragement and positivity but we can all do that to the people that are lonely and isolated.
We can all send notes and call the people that we know are struggling or maybe we know are not struggling to say we'rethinking of them.
There are multiple ways to connect that aren't physical and people are craving connection right now.
They are craving connection with friends is with family and would say that it's important that we all reach out to the people in our lives.
We can also help those people that are left behind.
There are a whole bunch of people left behind.
There are people that have no one and have no one to get groceries for them and have no one to actually check in onthem.
and I think it's the mostcanadian thing to do is to remember all of the people in our lives and even those people not directly in our lives, that have been left behind in all ofthis, that are more fragile and it might be the little old lady next door to you that has a hard time getting around that doesn'thave anyone in their life.
It might be the child on the road that looks at you beseeching you walking your dog.
We can donate to charities if we have a little left over.
I think through the act of giving and reaching out, actually it makes us all feelbetter.
When I step out of My own anxiety and My own worries and my own direct world and I reach out to other people, it makes me feel better, too.
and so I think together, this is what we mean when we say together Canadians will get through this.



I want to add one thing.
You suggested that the data released today would make people feel frightened and I thinkthat's right.
But what I would also like to say is information is power.
Facts are powerful.
What we have had over the past ten days or so is a tremendous sharing of information by governments across canadastarting with the provinces that have been doing a terrific job of sharing really detailed data wit people in their provincesdidn't then with Dr. Tam and drlroll-up. and I would really encouragecanadians to feel informed andempowered by that data becausewhat that data says to me is we need to do what we are doing andthat while the physicaldistancing actions that we areall taking in our daily livesare hard, for sure they're hardand it is hard to practisephysical distancing.
and it's really hard to loseyour job because of it, terrible.
Having said that, to me what thenumbers show, what the datashows is we're on the righttrack and it is in our power asdr.
Tam just said to achievethat ambitious target.
We can all do it and we are alla part of it and so turn thatvery understandable legitimatefear into power and a convictionthat we all need to do this hardthing to get the best possibleoutcome for Canadians.



Thank you.
and a follow-up for ministerhajdu.
I wonder, do you believe it'ssafe for parliament to sit inperson with this number ofM.P.s?



I know the house leader and the various folks that have their mind turned to this would only suggest convening in person with the appropriate measures in place to protect the health and safety of all of parliament.
I'm in Ottawa everyday and want to thank all of the cleaners who prepare this room for us every single day and inbetween, there are measures that we can take in temples of sitting distancely from one another that would be applied and certainly, if that decision is taken that we need to meet inperson, I will count on all of the professionals in our lives to keep us safe as we have to attend our work sites.



Two more questions.
Our next question, please goahead, your line is now open.
(speaking question).

---

**Question**:

Good afternoon.
This question is for Dr. Njoo.
I would like to ask you about the percentages we saw this morning about the percentage rate in the population.
Since the beginning of the pressconferences, you have been telling us about 5% rate of infection among those being tested across the country.
Does that not suggest that the1% infection rate scenario or2.5% of the population being infected are the most realisticscenarios.



Thank you for the question.
We said several times that the results of laboratory tests are always underestimating reality because not everyone is getting sick and not everyone who is exposed becoming infected.
and so, that's why we talk about5% infection rate, but we do know that many, many more people are infected or were infected and we're unaware of that rightnow.
In the future, we expect to develop further laboratory tests call serological tests to better determine the population that became infected.
and that will show up because they will have an immune response in the former of antibodies and the serology tests show that.
If we continue, our best efforts in flattening the curve, I think we have a good chance of achieving a better scenario, the best scenario of 1% rate of infection within the population.
However, it's too soon to know what will take place and I know that all provinces and territories are pursuing best efforts to increase their laboratory testing capacity an dare trying to test everyone who needs it. As much as they can.
We also know that the tests use genetic sequencing and I know that all provinces and territories are increasing their capacity for that type oftechnology.
.we are enhancing our toolkitswith further testing including serology testing.
and eventually, we will be able to test the entire population.
This is something that is evolving from day-to-day andfrom week to week.
I have a follow-up question, Dr. I would like to hear what youwould like to say about privateresidences, nursing homes, long-term care hope.
Homes.
We realize that in long-termcare residences, in nursinghomes and such places, thingsare well less managed.
Are there measures that youyourself can implement to helpprovinces immediately help all of those places function betteranswer, thank you for thequestion.
Yes, we do know that in someenvironments with some of themost vulnerable populations, like the ederly, as you said ininstitutions of long-termhealthcare and that type ofestablishment, we realize it ismore difficult in suchestablishments to use thenecessary measures.
It may be possible that therearen't many private rooms, forexample, in some of theseprivate institutions.
Now it's at the localprovisional territorial levelsand they're managing how thingswork in these institutions.
(please stand by). one last question.



Our question is from radio-Canada.
Go ahead.
This morning you told us about your data, your modelling, infection rates, mortality rates, you talked about the number of people in intensive care.
But there was also data about the number of sick people who require ventilators.
You have an idea of how many ventilators are in the country right now.
So what percentage of infected population will our -- at what percentage rate will our health care become overwhelmed?



Dr. Njoo is answering the question.



Thank you for the question.
It is difficult to estimate, but if we look at the worst-case scenario where everyone who needs intensive care may be a candidate to require a ventilator, we have calculated that and we know that we have more or less a sense of the number of ventilators that we currently have across the country.
But as we said several times, it's not just about the number of people who may require ventilation, but it's about the time frame in a population.
There may be 1, 000 people, but if all of those vulnerable people fall ill, they may require intensive care and perhaps also a ventilator, but if we manage to flatten the curve and of the thousand peoplein the population that require intensive care and/or a ventilator, it makes quite a difference because the health care system won't be overwhelmed.
If a thousand people all fall ill in the same week, or if it happens over several months, then the health care system can accommodate them and look after all the patients.



Do you have a follow-up.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
To better control the spread of the disease British Columbia and Alberta announced this week new strategies to ensure that those coming into the province comply with self-isolation orders and reduce the risk of the spread.
So to better contain this virus and perhaps following ways, willthe location or proposal -- [inaudible]



British Columbia with respect to new measures that were announced, the new measures they announced yesterday.
and we are working with all other provinces and territories as well.
In order to implement such measures.
Each province has its own special characteristics, but we strongly support what British Columbia has done in close collaboration with us and we are absolutely ready and not only ready but today and yesterday and the day before yesterday we're firmly committed to working with all provinces and territories on that issue.



That's all the time we have today.
this brings the press conferenceto an end.



**Rosemary**:

That is the end of the federal briefing from cabinet ministers and public health officials.
The national modelling today giving us a picture how long this might last and how many people could potentially die if we don't keep the strict measures in place.
The first wave could go until the summer.
The Prime Minister giving that stark warning that we have to be vigilant and continue these measures until there is a vaccine.
On a note, live to quÉbec city.
One of the four provinces with the most cases and deaths.
They're providing an update on the coronavirus.
891 cases.
I'll hand things off, I'm rosemary Barton.
See you tomorrow.



That means that 99% of those deaths are 60 and over.
It does mean it's reassuring for the younger people, but obviously, it also shows us
