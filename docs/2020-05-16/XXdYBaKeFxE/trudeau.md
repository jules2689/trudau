# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

-- against transphobia and biphobia.
Every year this is a day where we speak out against the stigma, discrimination and violence thattargets the lgtbq2 community.
Homophobia, transphobia and biphobia are never okay.
We all have a role to play in building a Canada where everyonecan be proud of who they are andwhom they love.
[voice of interpreter]wherever you live or what you doin life, your life has changed because of the pandemic.
Your needs, your concerns and your challenges are not the sameas before because your situationis not the same either.
Our government, therefore, introduced new programs to help us to get through this crisis, whether you're in studying or retiring, with or without a job.
At the same time, we are planning to provide more supportto organizations whose work is even more critical these days.
[ end of interpretation ]I want to start with some news on the medical front.
Health Canada has now approved the first canadian clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine at the canadian centre for vaccinology at dalhousie university.
The national research council ofcanada will be working with the manufacturers so that these vaccine trials -- so that if these vaccine trials are successful, we can produce and distribute it here at home.
Research and development take time and must be done right, butthis is encouraging news.
a few weeks ago we announced $40million for women's shelters andsexual assault centres across the country.
and for indigenous women and children fleeing violence, we'reproviding $10 million for emergency shelters.
Our goal was to help these organizations take all the necessary steps to protect people not only from violence but from COVID-19. To date, more than 500 women's shelters and sexual assault organizations have received additional support, including inas much house in hamilton, the miramichi emergency centre for women, the saskatoon interval house, and the south okanagan women in need society.
[voice of interpreter]community organizations such as shelters for women are a critical resource for the most vulnerable, and during the pandemic, their mission does notchange.
On the contrary, they are serving a larger clientele and must adapt to the realities of this pandemic.
We, therefore, introduced an emergency fund that now has an envelope of $350 million.
Most of that money will be distributed through various community organizations, such asthe red cross and United Way.
The details with respect to the registration process will be published on our partner associations' websites.
But organizations that need thatsupport will be able to apply starting on Tuesday.
[ end of interpretation ]I now want to turn to what we'redoing for parents.
As you've probably heard, we're boosting the Canada child benefit for the month of may.
You can expect to receive $300 more per child when you get yourbenefit this Wednesday, but that's not all.
Starting on July 20, we will increase the Canada child benefit once again for the upcoming year.
Every summer for the past three years we boosted the ccb to helpkeep up with the cost of living.
This summer will be no different.
As the price of your groceries go up, so will the benefit.
[voice of interpreter]we are already providing for targeted measures for students and parents because we are awarethat these are the groups that are facing particular challengesbecause of the pandemic.
But of course there are still people we need to support.
I'm thinking of women who are owners of their own businesses who have suffered a disproportionate effect of the pandemic.
Many have small businesses and are having problems with liquidity.
Others work in sectors that are totally paralyzed because of COVID-19, such as restaurants and hotels.
Now the obstacles associated with this pandemic are added to the number of obstacles women often face, such as gender-baseddiscrimination.
In order to help those women during this crisis, our government will be investing $15million in a new strategy for women entrepreneurs.
[ end of interpretation ]from the outset, our number one priority has always been to protect the health and safety ofcanadians, and we have been ableto count on the canadian red cross to do just that.
They have been playing a key role in supporting Canadians during this crisis, helping bothindividuals and communities withtheir most pressing needs.
But, like many organizations, the red cross is facing an increased demand for its services at a time where they are getting fewer volunteers andreceiving less in donations.
So today our government is investing $100 million to ensurethat the red cross can keep responding to COVID-19 while also preparing for potential floods and wildfires.
[voice of interpreter]I just want to close this morning by talking to the children and young people listening today.
I know that the last few weeks have not been easy for you.
You're anxious to see your friends and return to school and, yes, to have a break from your parents.
For the teenagers who are members of the lgtbq community, I know it's even more difficult.
It's difficult at home, but I know as well that you're far from your support networks.
But we will continue to be therefor you, and I know that together we will come through this.
Slowly things will start to get better.
So do continue to do your best at home and help your parents, because at the same time that helps us to get through this as a society.
Stay strong and we will see eachother on the other side.
Thank you very much.
