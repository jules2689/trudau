### Summary:


Our government, therefore, introduced new programs to help us to get through this crisis, whether you're in studying or retiring, with or without a job.
At the same time, we are planning to provide more supportto organizations whose work is even more critical these days.
[ end of interpretation ]I want to start with some news on the medical front.
Health Canada has now approved the first canadian clinical trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine at the canadian centre for vaccinology at dalhousie university.
a few weeks ago we announced $40million for women's shelters andsexual assault centres across the country.
and for indigenous women and children fleeing violence, we'reproviding $10 million for emergency shelters.
Our goal was to help these organizations take all the necessary steps to protect people not only from violence but from COVID-19. To date, more than 500 women's shelters and sexual assault organizations have received additional support, including inas much house in hamilton, the miramichi emergency centre for women, the saskatoon interval house, and the south okanagan women in need society.
[voice of interpreter]community organizations such as shelters for women are a critical resource for the most vulnerable, and during the pandemic, their mission does notchange.
Most of that money will be distributed through various community organizations, such asthe red cross and United Way.
But organizations that need thatsupport will be able to apply starting on Tuesday.
[voice of interpreter]we are already providing for targeted measures for students and parents because we are awarethat these are the groups that are facing particular challengesbecause of the pandemic.
I'm thinking of women who are owners of their own businesses who have suffered a disproportionate effect of the pandemic.
Now the obstacles associated with this pandemic are added to the number of obstacles women often face, such as gender-baseddiscrimination.
In order to help those women during this crisis, our government will be investing $15million in a new strategy for women entrepreneurs.
[ end of interpretation ]from the outset, our number one priority has always been to protect the health and safety ofcanadians, and we have been ableto count on the canadian red cross to do just that.
They have been playing a key role in supporting Canadians during this crisis, helping bothindividuals and communities withtheir most pressing needs.
But, like many organizations, the red cross is facing an increased demand for its services at a time where they are getting fewer volunteers andreceiving less in donations.
So today our government is investing $100 million to ensurethat the red cross can keep responding to COVID-19 while also preparing for potential floods and wildfires.
So do continue to do your best at home and help your parents, because at the same time that helps us to get through this as a society.
