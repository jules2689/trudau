# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

Ok. That is the president of Canada on this Friday before a long weekend, however you plan to enjoy it in these strange times.
Big news from the Prime Minister today that the wage six did programme is going to be extended until the end of August and I'll bring in My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen about that.
This has been welcomed by lots of people, I have to say.
As we were talking about, and as the Prime Minister suggested there, there is additional runway for businesses.
But there were other details as well.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and we're anticipating even more details around nine minutes from now from the finance Minister about expanding elgability.
You're right.
The big news is that it's extended until the end of August.
I think from a political perspective or policy perspective, it also gives us a real indication from the federal government that this is where they see financial aid going.
This is where they see the centre of economic recovery being versus the CERB.
Because you heard a number of questions directed at the Prime Minister, pretty bluntly.
Does this mean the CERB is over? will the CERB be extended? and there was no specific answer given there.
I sort of interpreted it as this is the wage package and subsidy that we are focused on. The idea is to get more people back on the payroll as businesses start to re-open.
That is going to be a difficult question going forward, though, for the Prime Minister, based on those -- the uptake numbers that we were discussing prior to his speech or to his remarks today and that is because the uptake for the wage programme at this point is not very high versus the CERB programme that a number of people are accessing.
Also, just while we were on air, we had four different businesses reach out to me on Twitter and instagram saying that they are having difficulty hiring people back, em on a part-time basis because they're accessing the CERB and they're not saying that they'd rather have the CERB, but there are worry from their employees about the safety of returning to work or the fact that the businesses who are hiring part-time workers back may not be able to pay those employees or are not willing to pay those employees as much as they might be making on the CERB.
There is a lot of different calculations for businesses as well as employees that might give us an indication as to why the uptake is what it is for now and what will be interesting to see is what changes over the next few months, especially as eligibility criteria is widened.
If that 30% revenue drop doesn't have to be met to qualify.
Does that increase uptake as well? that is where the government's eyes will be and just a final note.
The employment Minister had said last week to me that they will base that decision on whether to extend CERB on the uptake for the wage programme as well.
They will be looking at those numbers and they'll have to make a decision pretty soon.
If you think in a month that people will have to apply for their last $2, 000.
The rubber will hit the road for them and they have to figure out does it get phase out or cut off completely and a lot of those decisions will be based on what happens with this wage subsidy.



**Rosemary**:

and some of the details have been put out in a release.
But it has broadened this programme in a big way.
To include, for instance, partnerships that are up to 50% own by non eligible members.
It also will now apply to public colleges and schools, including places that do arts and languages because that was a problem for -- I don't know if it would include ballet schools that had been a problem for them.
So, they're obviously seeing problems, addressing them and broadening it out as they go and we'll hear more about that from the finance Minister in a moment.
I'll bring in Catherine, too.
As we were on air, there was news about Canadian forces members doing work in long temple care centres in Quebec, Catherine.



**Reporter**:

Yes.
That some of them have fallen ill with COVID-19. Although I don't believe we have a specific number.
I was interesting to see the Prime Minister talking about that saying that it is work that involves risk.
That they try to minimize those risks.
Interesting to see a Kurt answer from him when he was asked about offering danger pay for work domestically in Canada in those long-term care facilities, saying that the canadian forces would be looking at it. Another thing that was quite interesting in terms of a change of town, I was struck today around that issue of the emergency response benefit about how the Prime Minister's language has changed.
Him and his officials over the course of past couple of weeks.
Initially when we started asking these questions about people accessing the emergency response benefit who do not qualify.
The response we got again and again from the Prime Minister and Minister karla qualtrough, is Canadians are honest.
We believe in the honesty of Canadians.
When I first asked karla qualtrough about reports that some people were accessing the programme who don't and whether she'd heard that, she said I heard it anecdotely, but honestly I kind of reject that.
I believe that most Canadians are honest.
Today you heard him using the term "fraudsters," defending the approach that his government has taken on this but they are emphasizing that they're planning to crack down more later.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, Ok. Oh, there is $450 million for researchers in hospitals because it came out of some reporting that our colleague did at the Toronto star" where she highlighted a group of people, medical researchers who are not paid from the public sector but fall aural weird category.
So, the government had moved to make sure that those people who can't qualify for the wage six -- subsidy will get support.
$450 million for them.
I'm going to leave you both in just a moment as we wait for that press conference to start at the top of the clock.
One of points that Vassy high lighted about business owners struggling to get their employees to come back is demonstrated in our next guest and that is Laura mcnutt.
She owns a small business and she joins us now from Halifax.
Good to see you, Laura.



Good afternoon.
Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

You have a vintage clothing store.
It looks cool behind you there.
Tell me how you are -- how you are doing and what kind of support you have been able to access from the government.



Well, we're a very tiny business.
and a lot of the loan programmes have not applied.
and for the most part, I have been -- I've had to lay off My staff My sole staff and I was very interested in the Prime Minister's delivery this afternoon with respect to the wage subsidy and potential extension and that looks like it might be something that I could take advantage of. As you said, the CERB which served to compensate and effectively reward us for staying home, to My gait transmission, My staff [inaudible] in taking that CERB.
So it certainly has been challenging.



**Rosemary**:

So, do you -- do you -- I mean, the CERB has not been extended is maybe what people are thinking here.
Do you think that that will be enough to get them to come back or will they delay coming back because, as you point out, they are making more on the CERB?



Well, I was really hoping that there was a facility that would allow us retail and other businesses who need to provide some kind of -- we have to install elements and strategies to have a safe environment.
and staff would be really helpful.
If we could some kind of compensation for that while they're still having the CERB benefit, or at least a portion of the CERB benefit.
So, that flexibility would be really, I think, welcomed by a lot of businesses.
You know? sorry.



**Rosemary**:

That's Ok. It's My fault.
I had a couple of people on Twitter also say for smaller businesses like your own, this is great.
But I don't know that I have the 25% to pay My employee.
Would that be the case for you?



Absolutely.
You know, it really -- we're all hamstrung and we are very concerned about the appetite for revenue even in terms of retail are people going to come and shop.
There's so many questions and such a dynamic situation.
[please stand by]I really applaud the attempts tosupport all of our varied businesses.
I mean, it's a monumental task.
So I AM I'm really grateful, sincerely, for what appears to be available.
I mean, it's causing a lot of extra effort on our part as business owners, but we can't blame.
This is out of our hands.
and whatever assistance we can get is wonderful.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
Laura mcnutt, nice to meet you.
I hope it all works out.
She owns a cool vintage clothing store in Halifax.
We also found out today that the research -- sorry the student benefit opens up today as well for post-secondary students.
You can go online and started applying for that emergency aid benefit.
We've reached one student now.
Brandon is in aurelia, Ontario.
Good to see you, brandon.



Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Have you applied, iguess, for the benefit? where are you at?



6:00 AM this morning, I was up to apply when the portal opened.



**Rosemary**:

Any problems?



No, it's pretty smooth sailing.
In My case, I don't have a C.R.A. Account.
I called the C.R.A. I had to contact My bank, My financial institution to set up direct deposit to make it easier.
and other than that, I was in and out fairly quickly on the portal this morning.



**Rosemary**:

Good to know.
There was supposed to be something on the portal that would direct you to a job bank or at least say that you -- that there was a possibility you would be looking for a job.
Did you see anything like that?



In the attestation it did mention a piece of looking for work, however, I was surprised that I wasn't directed to a job portal.
That said, I did go and register for the government of Canada's job bank.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.



Just in case that would be a requirement.
and I encourage other students to look on there, too.
That said, and I'm sure we'll touch on this, there are some concerns around the follow-up onthat attestation and what that will look like.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister mentioned there are summer jobs.
The summer job bank is now open.
So you're right, there are possibilities there for students looking for work.
I imagine you call find for the 1250 benefit.
How does that factor into keeping you going? you know, paying for things? I don't think you can save money on 1250, but give me a sense how that helps you?



For myself, I barely made mayrent.
This will help a lot in the months coming forward, and, of course, for food.
I know for students it will vary if the students live in the north, or Vancouver, Montreal, but for myself, it will definitely -- it will help cover the basics.
and hopefully, alleviate some of the anxiety and stress I've had to deal with not having the employment I usually have during the summer.



**Rosemary**:

and will you then -- I guess you can make up to a thousand dollars and you can do volunteer work and get some money that way, will you pursue either of those things, or are you going to try to look for a full-time or part-time jobto get off the benefits?



I'm definitely keeping My options open.
One of the challenges for myself being in cottage country is that lot of the industry I work in is contract work in the culture and tourism industry.
So we've lost a lot of that in My area.
So I'm probably going to be looking more toward volunteering.
It will really just depend on what becomes available and, for me, it's about making sure that My health is not comprised in the work that I'm doing, whatever it ends up being.



**Rosemary**:

That's a good thing to think about.
You said you were stressed out.
How are you feeling about thingsnow? we're all sort of feeling the same way, but how are you feeling after today?



I'm feeling a little better.
I think -- you know, I still have concerns.
a lot of My friends still don't qualify because they're international students or recent graduates who graduated between September and December 2019, so you know students who are organising around this issue are still pushing to try to include them in some way, whether it's through the cesb or elsewhere.
I know there are concerns for students around whether that $1250 is going to be enough fortmonth, depending on where they live or their costs.
and the other thing that is kind of nerve-racking for myself and others is what is the reporting going to be like on the other end of this programme.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
Brandon, good of you to make the time for us today.
I'm glad you're feeling 5% less stressed out, that's good [laughter].



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

As always, we're here with all of the COVID-19 updates from health officials and cabinet ministers.
Today, we're expecting the deputy Prime Minister.
As the Prime Minister referenced, we're going to hear more from the finance Minister about the broadening of the wage subsidy to apply to many more organizations and companies as the government starts to wrap its head around, you know, the fact this is taking longer probably than any of us anticipated.
and so the programme now extended until the end of August.
and trying to catch up more people that were not going to have access to it, we'll bring that to you in a few moments.
Until I see -- there are two ministers there waiting remotely for the colleagues to enter the room, until they do, I'll bring back Vassy kapelos and catherinecullen to talk more.
I thought the business owner, Laura, that was interesting because it's an exact example I think of some of the concerns the conservatives have been raising when you have an employee who made less than the CERB now on the CERB and she wants to -- Laura wants her to come back, she wants the wage subsidy.
Anyway, it's very complicated and does show that it may be difficult to transition people from that emergency benefit onto wage subsidy, particularly if you're not paid as much in your actual job.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I think it was completely emblematic of all of the issues that business owners face in making the decision what kind of financial aid they're able to access.
and a couple of questions jumped in My head listening to the interview.
The first, if the government signalled the CERB was going to end, would that make a difference in the decision that employees make? at the same time, can they signal that at a time when not every employee is able to be areehired? and they may be needing to access that beyond the next two months.
If they signal that the programme is going to end, you won't lose all money, all aid from the government but you can balance that out with wages from your employer, will that make a difference? I think those kinds of decisionscan't be made too long from now only because people like your guest there, right.
Those are decisions she has to make right now.
and it will factor into whether or not that business can survive.
So the government is going to have to signal pretty soon what they plan to do with the CERB, even though they've been saying we're still in this acute phase where they can't. I'll be looking for those.



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to take you back it the press conference.
The deputy Prime Minister is giving us introductions.



Chrystia Freeland (deputy Prime Minister):... and of course, Minister of health, patty hajdu is here to answer questions.



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

Good afternoon.
I will start with the latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada.
There are 73, 829 confirmed cases, including 5, 499 deaths.
and 36, 528 cases, or 49%, have now recovered.
Labs across Canada have tested over 1, 232, 000 people for COVID-19 with 6% of these testing positive overall.
We're now testing an average of 26-28, 000 people daily.
These numbers change quickly.
and are updated regularly on ourwebsite.
With many areas of the country continuing to show decreased COVID-19 activity, and the Victoria day long weekend ahead of us, getting outside is top ofmind.
By the same token, there are many Canadians concerned about how to go about the next weeks and months safely.
This is a reasonable concern.
The reality is that COVID-19 is still out there and will be with us for the foreseeable future.
So as local authorities continue to slowly reopen recreational, social and economic spaces, the right and safest way to go out is to go out smart.
This means not dropping the vital layers of protection and are ingrained as our hygiene habits.
It means keeping 2 metres of physical distancing from others.
Avoiding touching common surfaces and cleaning our hands well and frequently.
and depending on the COVID-19 activity in your area, local authorities may recommend the use of non medical masks or facial coverings.
For example, when using public transit.
However, in some instances, going out is not okay.
We all have a responsibility to do things to keep others safe.
and to not risk a setback on the progress we've made.
That means covering every cough and sneeze.
For those who are experiencing mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19, it means staying home and apart from others.
So no matter where we are this long weekend, going out should only be an option if we can go out smart.
Living with COVID-19 means we'vegot to maintain our habits of physical distancing, frequent hand-washing, and staying home if sick.
Thank you.







**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you very much.
Dr. Tam.
Dr. Njoo.

**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Now we'll hear from our Minister of innovation, science and industry, navdeep Bains.



Thank you very much.
Over the past month our government has been working hard to make sure that all Canadians can keep food on the table and roof over their heads.
We've made changes to our employment insurance programme, introduced the Canada emergency response benefit and provided a wage subsidy for business owners to avert layoffs.
Today we're announcing a new programme that will provide temporary support for Canada's research talent.
Help sustain research capacity at universities and help research institutes during these extraordinary times.
[voice of interpreter] today we're announcing a new programme that will provide temporary support for Canada's research talent andhelp sustain research capacity at universities and health research institutes during thesetimes.
[end of translation] and health research institutes employ tens of thousands of highly qualifiedresearch personnel.
I'm talking about the researchers, lab technician, trainees and other support personnel who are the driving force for Canada's research, both universities and help research institutes like the sick kids research institute in toronto, the montreal clinical research institute.
These people are significant drivers of innovation.
They generate the discoveries and inventions that help people and the economy.
Many of these very researchers have the expertise we need to help us better understand COVID-19 and how to fight it. These highly qualified personnelare at risk of being laid off right now.
On government sources of revenue, of private sector contracts, charitable donations and endowments that account for much of the income that funds the research are drying up due to the COVID-19 crisis.
To help them, we'll be providingup to $450 million to help sustain the academic research committee through the crisis caused by COVID-19. [voice of interpreter] to help them, we'llbe providing up to $450 million to help sustain the academic research community through the crisis caused by COVID-19. [end of translation] health research institute.
Federal granting funding are also eligible for this programmein support of their research-related activity.
In addition to providing wage support for research personnel, this investment will also help university and health research institutes cover the unanticipated costs associated with maintaining research assetsat risk due to the pandemic.
and ramping up research activities once physical distancing measures are relaxed and ultimately lifted.
[voice of interpreter] this investment is in addition to measures we've put in place to maintain jobs and excellence in science and research in Canada.
[end of translation] critical that we support and retain our research talent.
Not only because they're Canadians that need our help right now, but also to ensure that our universities, health research institutes, have the talent and knowledge necessary to support post pandemic economic recover.
Years ago we made a single largest investment in fundamental research in canadianhistory.
That was because this governmentrecognizes the value of the workdone by scientists and researchers in this country.
and it is in that spirit that westand with them today.
Thank you very much.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Okay, thank you very much.
I'll just ask our technicians perhaps to turn up the volume if you can.
It hasn't been a perfect transmission.
and, bill, I will ask you, if you don't mind to speak a little bit slowly because the transmission is -- there is a little bit of static on it. If you speak slowly and we turn up the volume, our chances of understanding every word will beimproved.
Okay.
So now we're going to hear from our finance Minister, bill morneau.
Bill, please.



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Thank you.
I think as we all know, we've been working hard over the last months to protect jobs.
We introduced the Canada wage subsidy to do just that.
Today, the wage subsidy is helping almost two million workers across Canada and thousands of applications are being received every single day.
-- slowly starting to change away from lock down procedures.
We know that businesses continue to need support to keep workers on payroll.
Or even to rehire them as things pick up. That's why our government has announced we'll extend the Canada emergency wage subsidy to august 29, 2020.
We plan on consulting with businesses and labour representatives over the course of the next month.
and any potential adjustments that we make following the consultation period, including possible adjustments to the revenue decline threshold.
We'll seek to promote jobs and to promote growth.
[voice of interpreter] our government has announced its intention to extend the wage subsidy benefit to August 29. We will be consulting with various stakeholders in the months to come.
We will be making adjustments, including potential adjustments to the revenue decline thresholdto promote jobs and growth.
[end of translation] new regulations are effective immediately and retroactive to March 15th.
Wage subsidy is now available toregistered journalism organizations and all registeredcanadian amateur athletic associations.
This includes hockey Canada, lacrosse Canada and others.
Also, eligible now are tax exempt indigenous-owned corporations and partnerships that include indigenous governments and eligible employers.
This will ensure more indigenousemployers can support their workers.
and nonpublic colleges and schools are now eligible, including driving schools and art schools which foster Canada's world-class talent, like the national ballet school for example.
With wage subsidy, it will be available to partnerships with noneligible members as long as the noneligible members are not majority owners.
[voice of interpreter] we are also making changes to ensure that more workers can benefit from the wage subsidy.
New regulations will come into force immediately and will be back dated to March 15th.
The subsidy is also available tojournalism, amateur sport associations, nonpublic collegesand schools, including language schools and driving schools.
[end of translation] we also intend to propose legislation toprovide greater flexibility for employers to use the wage subsidy to rehire and support workers who may not have been regular employers in the early months of this year, but nonetheless important to operations.
Workers like seasonal employees.
[voice of interpreter] we also intend to make legislative changes to givegreater flexibility to employersfor the use of the subsidy.
and as a result, they will be able to hire back workers who perhaps were not regular employees during the first months of this year.
As was the case with temporary foreign workers.
[end of translation] formed on the amalgamation of two predecessor organizations.
My message to employers remains the same.
We hope that you apply to this programme and rehire your workers.
While much remains unknown, there is one thing that I do know.
Workers drive our economy.
By making sure that they have jobs to go back to, we're makingsure that Canada stands ready torecover.
Thank you very much.
Back to you.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Thank you very much, bill.
[voice of interpreter].



We're now prepared to take your questions.



As usual we start with the questions on the phone, one question, one follow-up and turnto the room.
Operator, over to you.



Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
The first question.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] myquestion is for Mr. Morneau.
Let me start over.
How much will the expanded wage subsidy programme cost with the expansion that you're proposing?



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

[voice of interpreter] this is an important question.
We are ensuring employers wage subsidy will be available until the end of August.
This is important for their -- as I said, we are going to be considering adjustments.
Today I cannot say specifically or precisely what our estimates are, but when we have more information, we will provide theappropriate figures.



**Reporter**:

On a different subject again for Minister morneau, with respect to health transfers to the provinces.
You know as I do that the health budgets will be exploding with the situation we're currently facing.
Are you open to increasing health transfers to the provinces?



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Bill, before you answer the question, there is a request here from the reporters in Ottawa that you repeat your reply to the first question in English, please.



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

So I have to remember the reply to the first question, is that it? [laughter] the first question was about the wage subsidy and our expectations on costs.
and as I mentioned, first and foremost we want to give assurances to businesses that the wage subsidy will be extended to the end of August.
That gives the ability to rehire workers with some sense of security.
That said, we're looking to potentially make adjustments to the programme to make sure it encourages hiring.
So with those adjustments which we're going to consult on still to come, I can't yet make a precise estimates on the cost implications.
[voice of interpreter] with respect to ourapproach for working with the provinces, clearly, there will be costs.
We will be facing difficulties because of COVID-19 and the costof our health care system will be very significant.
It will be subject of our discussions.
In discussions with the provinces we'll look at how we can work together.
This remains the situation with provincial and federal jurisdictions.
But, of course, we'll be holdingdiscussions and we will be working together to ensure that our system works and that we have sufficient funding to continue to face COVID-19. [voice of interpreter]



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

and I could also add that the question of cost in the fight against COVID-19 is something that was discussed by the Prime Minister and the provincial and territorial leaders yesterday night.
The Prime Minister stated once again that the federal government is there to help the provinces and territories with their work to fight COVID-19, including on very important issues such as testing.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Operator, the next question?



The next question, Canadian press.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi. This question is for Dr. Tam and the deputy Prime Minister as well.
Given the discussions that the province is stepping up more coordinated approach on contact tracing and its importance in rebooting the economy, what is the urgency -- what urgency do you feel about getting a national plan in place to deal with contact tracing? and when do you see that taking shape? and what will it look like?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

So contact tracing is one of the absolute cornerstones of our public health strategy going forward.
Contact tracing is, of course, done at the local level with support as needed from the provincial and federal levels.
So I think from a -- in generalities done by public health staff orofficials, men ted -- augmented by the increased capacity that has been put in place by jurisdictions.
Some of them have had students and other surge capacities as well.
We are offering additional support as needed on that front.
There have been a number of discussions about technological applications.
There are some jurisdictions that have began to try some of this and sharing some of the lessons.
I do know that there has been further discussions I think at the ministerial level.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

I can just add, mike, it's a really good question.
As you have seen in the readout from the call between the first ministers last night, teasing and contact tracing and working together on that was one of the main issues discussed.
There was a real enthusiasm of all of the first ministers and of course of the Prime Minister for us as a country to really continue to step up testing and contact tracing.
and a real shared recognition that doing that is very important as we look towards reopening our economy.
There was some discussion of the collaboration that is already happening.
For example, this week the federal government has been workingfollow-up.



**Reporter**:

Okay.
For the deputy Prime Minister, United States media reports report the trump administration wants the border restrictions to have an indefinite time line.
Are they asking for the current non-essential travel, to be expanded beyond the 21st and is Canada pushing back on that?



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

As you know, mike, I never think it's a good idea to disclose private negotiations.
I think it's never good to negotiate in public.
But let me just assure canadiansthat decisions about the Canadian border are going to be taken by Canadians in the Canadian national interest with the health and safety of Canadians first and foremost.
Our government is taking a very prudent approach and in that -- the Canada-United States border was discussed by the first ministersyesterday also and there was, I would say, a widely shared view expressed by the premiers that taking a prudent approach right now is the right thing.
We are actively discussing with the United States what to do next on the Canada-United States border.
It is a very, very collegial andvery friendly conversation.
and I think it would be absolutely fair to say that bothsides feel the current measures are working really, really well.
In restricting non-essential travel, but also really importantly for both countries ensuring that essential travel continues.
and that will be particularly important as we look towards thereopening of our economy for areas like the auto sector, for example.
So the essential travel is stillhappening, both countries feel very comfortable with that.



**Ron**:

--



**Rosemary**:

I'm going to pull away.
We'll come back in a moment.
I want get to other news about the Canadian military.
We heard from the prime minister and from representatives of the Canadian forces that there has been a number of members -- and we'll try to get answers here --who have been affected.
Who have contracted COVID-19. They are, of course, in a number of long-term care centres in quÉbec.
Lots of them in quÉbec.
I think we're up to 25 and 5 in Ontario to help the staffing of those long-term care centres andin there as support mechanisms.
Joining me now to discuss this, brigadier general.
Thank you for making the time.



Thank you for having me. Nice to see you, ms. Barton.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me what you can about the Canadian forces members who have contracted the virus? if you have a number that is helpful.



If I may first say I'm happy to be here.
We have more than a thousand soldiers, some medical professionals and general support troops that are operating in those 25 long-term care facilities.
Obviously, no missions are without any risks.
I'm not at liberty to talk to specific numbers, but numbers are very low.
We knew up front that this was apart of the risk for our forces.
and like any Canadians at this time, be it on that assistance mission or just as being a canadian, there is a risk of being infected.
But much important part of our preparations was to make sure that we knew how to don and wearthe personal protective equipment to ensure max -- max safety for the personnel.



**Rosemary**:

Can I ask you about that personal protective equipment? was the same kind of P.P.E. Given to each member of the forces or was it different depending on where they were deployed? because, of course, some long-term care centres are in a much more serious situation thanothers.



So the P.P.E., the personal protective equipment, is definitely aligned with the conditions in the centre, so we have our -- you know, we have our health care professional in the forces, we are ensuring thatproper measures are followed andthat our troops, like the provincial health professionals, are wearing what is appropriate to the conditions -- with the conditions they're operating in.



**Rosemary**:

Can I ask you again, now about testing.
Obviously, I don't know if you're testing -- are you testing everyone that is going into the homes? are you testing based on symptoms?



So different situations with different centres, but again, following protocols which are well defined and in line with health professionals.
So everybody that went through -- that went through the deployment process went through a screening, a medical screening.
and then during the assistance in the centres, depending on the situation in some of the centres, some situations are more dire and then there might be some of our members that are tested, but if not, it goes through a screening process.



**Rosemary**:

I was going to say, are they tested on a daily basis as they're going in and out? or if they're in those dire situations as you point out?



Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of specifics with that.
I think what is key to highlight here is that we have very thorough process.
Again Canadian armed forces health professionals that are working with health professionals to ensure that our folks are well tested.
The way we're approaching the assistance mission, we bring groups of 30-40 in the long-termcare facilities.
The idea is that we're dedicatedto that centre so it prevents --it prevents us going from placesto places, which brings safety to a higher level.
In those -- in those long-term care facilities, we're doing a lot of different work.
Some focused on the patients themselves, providing assistancein the caring of patients, feeding them, changing bedding, making sure they're clean, but there is also a number of logistical tasks that our folks are taking on, be it food or cleaning.
and even some manageal where there are gaps in the centre.
It's a tough situation.
We never wish for these type of situations, but we're proud of the work we're doing and committed to assisting our provincial partners.



**Rosemary**:

I know it's difficult work and I certainly -- I certainly know Canadians appreciate it, particularly in the provinces where you're deployed.
I've been wanting to talk to someone about this because it is so important and I appreciate you all stepping up to do this.
Have you now had to isolate other members of the forces because you have a couple of cases? we've heard three cases, just to be clear.
You have a few cases now.
Have you had to pull anybody out of their deployment and isolate people? can you give me an idea how that is dealt with?



So again, deliberate process.
If someone is identified, suspected or tested positive, then there is -- I might struggle with the English term -- but it analysis, which means what needs to be done with the rest of the team.
So it might mean that in some cases other folks will be put inisolation, or in most other situations because our folks have been well trained and they are wearing the personal protective equipment, then the rest of the team is safe and can continue on with providing that much required assistance.



**Rosemary**:

Has that happened yet? or you're not sure?



No, it is -- so like I said, I'm not at liberty to talk numbers, but some folks have either been on operation laser, which is the assistance mission, or just a normal business has been infected, very low numbers.
But again, that process that I just talked about is done so that we can ensure safety and protection of our force so that when those missions come our way, we're ready to bring our troops and deploy and provide the assistance.



**Rosemary**:

You'll forgive me for again trying to be specific when you might not be able to be, but that's part of what I have to do as My job.
We had heard there was a case atone of the hardest-hit chslds inmontreal.
is there anything happening at that chslds now that would be different because of the potential case there?



So, yeah, it was covered greatly in the news.
Difficult situation there.
and so the measure that was taken was the wearing of personal protective equipment grade -- has been upgraded.
and the whole -- the whole centre is basically considered ahoy zone.
So with those measures in place and analysis by the -- analysis to determine what could be the cause, then we're ensuring proper safety of our folks.
So we're still in there operating with proper protection measures and mitigating measures to provide that care to those patients that really require it.



**Rosemary**:

Are any of the cases of COVID-19 with the members, are they serious? or are they stable? can you give me a sense of how they're doing?



So, you know, we are -- our forces are fit, younger, and again as part of that screening, that much required preparation, deliberate process to ensure that when we launch into the assistance mission we have the folks that are prepared and fit for that job, that's part of ensuring that we're mitigating risk in a mission of assistance that, again, is not without risk.
and just like the other health care professionals are facing risk.
I would like to maybe highlight the work and the team work between those provincial health care professionals and our members from the Canadian armed forces.
I was visiting at a centre the other day and was told that one of the ladies there, with unof the nurses -- ones of the nurses, had been working for 40 days straight.
This is why we're there.
This is why we're taking the proper protective measures.
Again not without any risks, but very deliberate approach, very serious approach, so that we can be there alongside our provincial partners and that we can take care of those patients so where required we can bring dignity -- the proper level of dignity back in those centres.



**Rosemary**:

Last question to you.
The Prime Minister was asked today whether forces members should be receiving some sort of danger pay for the mission.
Do you know if that is happening or being considered?



We're always proud to launch operations.
That's our role.
We're there to protect Canadians, defend the nation, at home and abroad.
If more money comes as part of it, then people will be happy, but I'm not sure where the policies are on that.
But this is not what us, it's the ability for us to be there with those quÉbecers that require it.



**Rosemary**:

Well, it is important work.
I'm sorry it had to be a couple of cases that gave us a chance to speak with you about it. But I AM glad you did that.
I know Canadians are very grateful to you and all our fellow members for stepping up in this way.
Brigadier general, thank you very much, I appreciate it.



Thank you for having me. Have a great day.



**Rosemary**:

Wanted to get to that because it was a little bit of breaking news.
We'll go back to Ottawa where ministers and health officials are still speaking.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

Free shots on goal? I think we have to let our reporter friends ask more questions if they wish.
Bill, can you say a few words so we can see if we can hear you? okay.
Clearly bill can't hear us. [laughter] looking very relaxed.



I think we'll just pause and resume in a few minutes.



**Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister)**:

If you guys have another question or two, you can ask one.



**Reporter**:

I have a curiosity.
[laughter] if we have time.
I'm wondering how Dr. Tam, you suggest to those who are working in essential services and have been working very long hours for the last couple of months to keep the economy going and to maintain health care system, how you deal with the potential of burn out? and avoid that?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

I'm sure Minister hajdu is very much a supporter of maintaining the mental health of workers.
I think health care workers have been working these long hours, not just health care workers, many other essential services, people who keep many supplies going.
and I think there are many programmes set up for employees if you're a part of those programmes, take advantage of it for sure.
The Minister may want to talk about the suite of applications that we have, but it's a matter of individuals being supported by their families, by their communities, by the work environment they work in as well as getting help when needed.
I have to say as a health worker and perhaps someone who has been working many hours, we're not very good sometimes at asking for help.
I know doctors are not very good at all in spotting our own, you know, health needs.
So I think we also need to be able to tell our colleagues -- always say to My staff, you know, if I'm behaving strangely, would you please tell me? because I might not know myself.
[laughter] and behaviours out of the ordinary for me affects how everybody else works on My team.
So I think partly a few days earlier I think during mental health week I said, you know, you've got to kind of talk about how you feel, which is not easy for many.
Health workers in particular feel they have to help others.
and sometimes neglect to sort of help themselves, so we have to be aware of that as well.



I'm told we have Minister Bains and morneau on the phone.



**Reporter**:

Minister morneau, if you could repeat the figure that you gave for the total amount of stimulus.
That would be much appreciated as the line cut out.
As a follow-up, we're wondering, you have said that it's too early to give a fiscal update orbudget at this point, but one of our finance officials told the community this week there was work ongoing on a fiscal update, so I'm wondering how you jive those two positions?



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Thank you.
I can hear you clearly now.
I hope you can hear me.



**Reporter**:

It's much better, thank you.



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

In responding to your first question around the scale of the direct support.
The report on the direct support is at $151.7 billion.
Obviously, enormous support for Canadians as we try to get through this time and significant support for businesses to find a way to get across a difficult period.
With respect to the provision ofinformation, obviously, we're being transparent as we announce new programmes to be sure to give a sense of the expectation of the cost of those programmes.
You heard one of My finance officials this week talk about our need to be constantly ready to provide fiscal updates.
We're constantly consulting with business and with industry to get a good sense of where our economy is going.
That said, we want to make sure that the situation is more stable before we give an outline of a fiscal update.
We're in a very fluid situation and as we have a more stable situation from which to provide economic forecasts, we will come forward with the forecasts which we think is appropriate.



Thank you, Minister.
Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Julie van dusen, CBC.
So there was a huge uptick on the CERB, the $2, 000 a month benefit, not so much on the wagesubsidy.
I'm wondering if the economy starts to reopen, is the CERB a disincentive in that some people might rather stay at home? maybe they're too afraid to go to work or maybe they're offered less than the CERB offers, the $2, 000 a month?



**Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, Julie, this is an important question and it's something we're working on. The one correction I'd make is that both programmes have had really significant impact.
We've had, as you know, more than 7.5 million people who have gone on the emergency response benefit, but we've also had millions of people through their employers apply through the wagesubsidy.
So we see both of the program mesas very important to support employees and people.
and as we move forward, we are exactly as you said trying to make sure there is incentive for an employer keep their employee son or to rehire workers as we carefully open up. and at the same time, we want to make sure there is support for people who are facing the challenge of not being at work.
So we're going to work towards the extension of the wage subsidy appropriately and obviously have to look at how that relates to the emergency response benefit and the employment insurance system.
That work is ongoing.



**Rosemary**:

We're going to pull away from the Minister briefing.
It had a lot of technical difficulties.
So it's good I cut away at one point to speak to the brigadier general about quÉbec.
But got a sense of the government support.
More than $151 billion that has been brought in to bear by the government to try to support both Canadians and overall economy.
I'll bring back Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen for their take on anything they heard or missed while doing the interview.



**Vassy**:

I want to jump off what you outline.
The magnitude, the quantification of the amount of financial aid and the programmesthat the government has billed out in ten weeks, not even ten weeks.
I was looking up as soon as Mr. Morneau said.
According to the government over the last five years, the government has authorized average spending of $274 billion while spending $151 billion.
Total spending per year on all programmes -- all programmes -- $250 billion in average.
So we're already at $150 billion just on COVID-19 measures not to mention whatever else the government has to spend on regular stuff.
I think that number is staggering and to think we're just really 10 weeks into something we've been told could last up to two years, depending often the development of treatment or vaccine, gives us sense of why so much of the conversation in the past few days, politically at least, has centred around, can you provide us with more information about what you plan to do and how you might address, much later down the road, this much money? spending this much money and how you plan to rectify that in the future.
Obviously, those aren't easy questions to answer at this point, but those questions, and Minister morneau got them from the journalists and opposition, Wayne Easter at some point, how are you thinking about government spending over the next couple of years? over the next couple of months? you may not be able to tell us exactly, but can you give us a sense of what you're planning I think are genuine questions.



**Reporter**:

Just to highlight this is a moment of transition that the government is looking at today.
They're talking about using the wage subsidy as the tool to get Canada moving forward, but there are so many questions that neither we, nor the government, no one knows the answer to. Are businesses ready? are employees ready and is this the right tool to make it happen? the Prime Minister talked about making the economy come roaring back, but he said it was a confuted process.



**Rosemary**:

Have a good weekend.
