# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The last few months will have changed your daily routine in ways big and small.
Canadians in every sector have faced challenges and tough choices at work and that includes people at research institutes who are making the discover is that keep us safe and healthy.
Science and research is our door to a brighter future and that has never been clearer.
But because of the pandemic, many labs have closed or are at risk of imminently closing.
So, understandably, people are worried about their jobs and their future.
So, today, we are announcing $450 million to help researchers and research institutions bridge to better times.
For universities and affiliated research institutes that have been affected by this pandemic, we will provide temporary support on wages, by delivering this money through federal granting agencies, we will get help out as quickly as fob the people who need it. 



**Interpreter**:

Today, I AM announcing that we will be investing $450 million to help researchers and research institutions get through the crisis.
These funds will help to maintain the wages of people in conducting research so that they can continue their essential work.
We're lucky because Canadian researchers are among the best in the world.
Every day, they make discoveries that help us to stay healthy and safely and we have to support them.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

For too many Canadians have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. As our economy gradually re-opens, whatever -- wherever we can do so safely, we need you back.
We need you in your job.
On your team.
Bringing life into our communities and our economy.
That's exactly why we brought in the Canada emergency wage subsidy back in March.
Because, wherever possible, we wanted to keep you connected to the job you love and to the workplace where you contribute every day.
When we launched this programme, I talked about the neighbourhood spots it would support.
The local restaurant, the salon, the gym that had been forced to close or seen business Dr. up. Today a lot of those places are looking toward re-opening and they need to be able to bring back workers and hire more as this happens.
So this morning, I can confirm that we will extend the Canada emergency wage subsidy by another three months, to the end of August.
Business owners, please take confidence from this announcement.
You now have some runway to catch your breath as you get restarted.
So, please, bring back your employees.
Going forward, we need to make sure that this programme keeps working for people.
That it keeps encouraging employers to rehire staff and even expand, where possible.
Over the next month, we'll work with business and labour stakeholders on any adjustments that might be needed.
One of things we'll be looking at is the 30% revenue decline threshold for eligibility.
As businesses start up, meeting a decline shouldn't be a barrier to growth.
I know we'll figure out solutions where needed while continuing to support employers and employees.
Because that is who this is all about.
If you are a business owner and if you're a worker, we're here for you.
Now and throughout the summer.
At the same time, we also broadened elgability for this benefit.
Minister morneau will have more details shortly.
But these changes will get even more people back on the job.
So to business owners who haven't apply -- haven't applied yet, go online and do so. The help is there for you.




**Interpreter**:

Today, I can confirm that we will be extending the wage subsidy by three months until the end of August.
If you are a business owner and you are preparing to re-open your business, this subsidy will be there for you and for your employees.
We must ensure that the programme continues to help people, that it encourages employers to rehire their workers and even extend their activities as much as possible.
So, over the course of the next month, we will be working with business stakeholders and workers to make any necessary adjustments.
and we will be looking, in particular, at the elgability threshold, which is a decline in revenue of 30%. when businesses are red doi do start up again and expand, that threshold should not be a barrier to growth.
We will also be extending the scope of the wage subsidy to encourage even more people to go back to work.
Minister morneau will have additional details a about this later today.
Since the month of March, we have been looking to provide more support for parents and workers, students and seniors and for the industry's hardest hit as well as small businesses.
We are helping people who need that help.
and today, we are honouring those commitments.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Today kicks off this year's hiring period for Canada's summer jobs.
The first set of job postings are up on the job bank website and thousands more will be posted over the coming weeks.
If you are a student or recent grad, go to jobbank.

and tell your friends about it, too.
If they don't already know.
There are lots of opportunities available.
These placements mean a paycheque and valuable experience and jobs that are key to our fight against COVID-19. No one programme can single handedly solve the fact that there are fewer jobs out there because of pandemic.
So, for students and recent grads who still need help, you can apply for the Canada emergency student benefit go. To Canada.
Ca to sign up. For parents who received the Canada child benefit and bhaoem get the g. S.t.-h. S.t. Credit, we also have more news to share today.
Although everyone should do their best to file their taxes in time for the new June 1 deadline.
Your benefits won't automatically be cut off if, for some reason, you missed that date.
Your c. C.b. and g. S.t. and h. S.t. Benefits will continue until the end of September.
But be sure, in order to keep getting them, you need to file your taxes as soon as you can so there is enough time for the paperwork to be processed and you will be able to continue receiving those benefits beyond September.




**Interpreter**:

If you're a student, do consult the job bank website where we will be putting a first set of postings up today.
If you cannot find a summer job, the emergency student response benefit will be there for you.
You are able to apply starting today.
Everyone should try as much as possible to file a tax return by June 1. But if you're not able to do that in time, your benefits such as the Canada child benefit or the g. S.t. Credit will not stop all of a sudden.
You will continue to receive them until the end of September.
But we are still asking you to file your income tax return as soon as possible so that we have the time to process your file and so that you can continue to receive those benefits after September.
People are going through tough times right now.
But by working together, and by being there for each other, we will come out of this.
Thank you.
