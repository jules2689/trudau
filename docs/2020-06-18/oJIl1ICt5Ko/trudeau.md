# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to recognize the great work that all of team Canada has done ahead of today's united nations security council vote.
We're running for the security council seat because we saw a unique opportunity to engage with our partners across the u. N. to build sustainable peace and to make real progress on the issues that matter.
Around the world, people want many of the same things.
Clean air, a real shot at success, a fair economy and a just society.
and to make that happen, we have to work together.
Today and every day.
That is something that our government is ready to do. At the beginning of the year, I don't think anyone could have predicted what the coming months would hold.
COVID-19 is truly an unprecedented challenge.
and right from the start, it was clear that we needed to put everything we had on the table in response.
So that's exactly what our government did.
In the space of a few week, we introduced the Canada emergency response benefit and the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
We created loans for small businesses and put in place support for specific sectors that have been hardest hit.
We rolled out help for seniors, for students, for families and every step of the way, we kept Canadians up to date about what we were doing to respond.
Taken together, we've now introduced the largest economic measures in our lifetimes, measure that are helping millions of people.
Because that's what the situation demanded.
Now as we begin to safely and gradually restart, I know people are wondering what this pandemic will mean for their jobs in the long run and what the impact has been on our economy and on our path forward.
We hear that.
and we want to make sure that you have the best information possible.
So today, I can announce that in the house of commons on July 8, our government will be releasing an economic and fiscal snap shot.
This will give Canadians a picture of where our economy is right now, how our response compares to that of other countries and what we can expect for the months to come.
is later today, Minister morneau will formally announce in parliament that we will be presenting this economic and fiscal snapshot.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

From the beginning of this crisis, we knew that COVID-19 represented an unprecedented challenge for our country.
So, our response had to reflect that.
In just a few weeks, our government introduced a whole series of measures to help people get through this difficult time.
We introduced the emergency response benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.
We provided loans to small businesses and gave targeted support to sectors that had been hardest hit by the crisis.
Whether you're a student or retired, with or without a job, we wanted to be there for you.
As we now start to re-open the economy, a lot of people are wondering what to expect in the coming months and what this crisis will mean for our economy.
That's why today we are announcing that our government will publish a snapshot of our economic and fiscal situation on July 8 in the house of commons.
That will give us an idea of the state of the economy and how our response compares to that of other countries and what we can expect in future.
Later today, Minister morneau will be informing parliament that will occur.
Measures to mitigate the consequences of the crisis on our economy is only part of the challenge.
We are also working very hard to ensure that hospitals and frontline workers have the equipment and all the material that they require.
and on that note, I have some good news to share with you.
First, our government has signed an agreement with the montreal company galenas to produce silica microbeads essential for testing and this week health Canada certified ventilators produced by two canadian groups, c. a.e. and the consortium ventilators for Canadians.
They now will be able to ramp up their production to produce the 20, 000 ventilators that have been ordered.
Two years ago, I was at c. a.e. To announce an investment in worker training.
Today we're seeing why it is so important to support not only talent, but innovation here at home.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Researchers across the country make incredible discover is can every day from rapid advances in understanding COVID-19 over the last few months, to years' long studies of climate change and cancer treatments.
It's in everyone's interests that they continue doing their vital work.
So today, we're announcing almost $500 million in funding through an annual discovery grants programme.
This money will support thousands of Canadian researchers and their ground-breaking work, whether they're studying viruses, developing a. I. or making strides in chemical engineering.
Canadians are innovative and creative and that is something we'll always support.
This morning, I want to speak about help for another group of Canadians who do vital work -- our fish and seafood producers.
The women and men who work on fishing boats and in processing plants keep our families fed.
But they have been facing some really tough times lately.
That is why, in the next week, we're opening applications for two additional programmes to support the sector.
As of today, the canadian fish and seafood opportunities fund is available to help producers access new markets, reach new customers and maintain a foothold internationally.
Canada's seafood is among the best in the world and this fund will help spread the word.
On Monday, processors will also be able to apply for help through the canadian seafood stabilization fund we created this spring.
The fund will provide support for everything from buying P.P.E. To keeping workers safe, to purchasing freezers so products stay good while producers find buyers.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Today, we are announcing the re-opening of the canadian fish and seafood opportunities fund.
This programme will help seafood producers to access new market, serve new clients and retain their presence on international markets.
and Monday, processors will also be able to apply for funding under the canadian seafood stabilization fund that we created earlier this spring.
This is support that they can use for many things, including buying individual protective equipment, protecting their employees or buying freezers in other words to preserve their products.
If it takes longer than usual to find buyers.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to end today with an update on parks Canada.
For a lot of people, no Summer is complete without getting the tent packed, the kids in the car and the time off to go camping.
Now, because of the pandemic, many campgrounds had to close temporarily.
But the good news is, is that as of Monday, parks Canada will gradually start re-opening some of their camping sites.
No matter what you're planning this summer, whether it's camping or barbecues, keep following public health recommendations and keep doing your part to protect the people around you.
Together, we will get through this.
Merci.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phones for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?
