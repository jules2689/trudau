# Q & A

Thank you.
Merci.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to come back to the extension of the CERB that you announced yesterday.
a number of people, including fran√áois legault and chambers of commerce are concerned that this will just maintain the disincentive to work.
At the time you said this was an emergency and you had to help people right away.
and that's why you said it would not be changed.
But now three months later, don't you think you should take the time to adjust the CERB?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Well, there are currently some three million Canadians who would like a job, who lost their job and are not finding any employment.
Yes, we know that the economy is gradually re-opening.
and that some jobs are being created.
But the fact remains that there are still far too many people out there who are looking for jobs, without those jobs being available.
So, we have to be there to help those people who need support, who need the CERB in order to pay for groceries or support their families.
Yes, we are encouraging people and bringing in measures to encourage people to take any jobs that become available.
But we're very far from being in a situation where there are enough jobs for everyone who wants to work.
and that's why we are extending the CERB for an additional eight weeks.
Follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Yes.
I understand.
That's something you've repeated a number of times over the last few days.
But I want to ask a question -- why would it be impossible to change the CERB? I know that there are people who still can't find work.
But the question is not to -- to not extend it, but perhaps to change it. To adapt it. and your Minister qualtrough said that you intend to impose sanctions on fraudsters the.
-- on fraudsters.
So, how do you intend to do that since the bill did not go through? well, I think it is important that people understand that, in a crisis such as this one, we had to get the money out the door as quickly as possible with as few checks as possible.
With respect to people's individual circumstances because those people needed the money quickly.
and a we've said right from the very beginning, we want to ensure that the people who receive the CERB are not trying to defraud the system.
Now we understand and we saw that there are hundreds of thousands of Canadians who have already repaid some payments under the CERB that they should not have received.
So, the system is working.
But unfortunately there is a small number of criminals and fraudsters who have taken advantage of that system in order to collect that money while others are supporting each other and there will be consequences for those individuals.

**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Last week, many were still saying that the situation in Canada was still too uncertain to provide an economic update.
Now you're saying the reverse today.
So, what changed? well, an economic update would, in fact, be unrealistic.
An economic update includes projections of exactly what might happen in the coming months and years of over a three to five-year horizon.
Obviously we are not in a position to present that.
But every two weeks, the finance department has been sharing all available information on the measures we've introduced and we are certainly capable of bringing together of that data and that information on what we're doing with a couple of projections as to what could happen in the next few months.
So, that is why we are going to continue to be transparent and open, present a snapshot of the economy in a few weeks so that people can see what the state of the economy is now and whatcould happen in the coming weeks.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I've consistently said that an economic and fiscal update would be unrealistic right now because it automatically includes projections for a year, three years, five years ahead of time, which quite frankly we simply couldn't make any responsible predictions about.
However, every two weeks over the past number of months, we have put forward all the information from finance to the finance committee, to parliamentarians on the measures we have moved forward on to give a precise accounting on what we've done.
We've continued ed to do that and n -- and, in a few weeks, we'll gather that all together in a sense of where we are, compared to other countries and some estimates on where we could be in the coming months.
But this will not be an economic or fiscal update.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Yes, so I understand this -- you're not going beyond a horizon of several months.
So until when will we have an idea of the state of the economy? well, the Minister of finance is currently working on this.
Obviously we want to provide as much information as possible to people.
But we also want that information to be helpful.
So, the Minister of finance will be able to assess what that will include a little later.



Next question, operator.

Thank you.

Next question, Teresa wright from the Canadian press.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Yes.
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Just following up on what you just said in the fact that you said uncertainty makes it impossible to provide a meaningful fiscal update.
Given that, what is the value of this fiscal snapshot that is coming in July, given all that uncertainty that we face?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I I this it will be useful for people to see the scale and the details on everything that we have put out.
As I said, we have been keeping the finance committee and, through them, parliamentarians updated every two week on all the measures we've been flowing out.
At the same time, pulling them all together in a look over the past few months on all the measures we've done, comparing the measures we've done in Canada to countries around the world.
Some may have done better.
Some won't have done nearly as much.
So we get a sense of where we are compared to others and a sense of what the coming weeks or months could look like.
These are things that are useful for people to come together on. Because of the transparency we demonstrated every step of the time, it is a consistency with what we're trying to do.



Follow-up question?



**Reporter**:

Yes.
On another issue, it often takes years for the RCMP to respond to formal recommendations from the force's civilian watchdog.
is this accept tonight you?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I -- acceptable to you?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

One of the things we've seen come to light over the past weeks and months is that our systems are not adequate to resfonlds the concerns that racialized Canadian and indigenous Canadian and others who want to see a reduction of systemic discrimination in our institutions move forward quicker.
So we are going to move much quicker on responding to these thing, on making changes no our institutions, to really go after systemic discrimination.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I think what we've been seeing for several weeks now is the speed at which our institutions are responding to complaints and to the need to change and that change is too slow.
It must be expedited.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Hello.
Government in the past have used omnibus bills to put a lot of side legislation into budget packages.
When you do present a full budget, is it -- will you commit to refraining from using an omnibus bill to put in other measures?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have been consistent in our approach over the past couple of years.
These are things that we're fairly strict on. It's something that we saw previous conservative governments significantly abuse which is why we made commitments to not have omnibus legislation and we're going to be sticking with that.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

We saw in the past, conservative governments abuse omnibus bills.
There were many measures included in them that were not connected to the specific goals of the bill or the budget.
That is why we have limited the number of measures within the legislation so that we can have a better debate in parliament and we'll continue to take that approach.



**Reporter**:

Given the rise in gig and tech companies, do we have to take another look at social programmes or regulation or taxation of these kinds of gig employers when we get through this tough moment?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think absolutely, Greg.
That is something that we need to look at. We've seen this crisis expose real vulnerabilities within our communities, within our employment systems.
We are responding to this emergency right now.
But we're also reflecting very carefully on how we can build back better, build back fairer, build back greener.
Make changes to our systems so that going forward, whether there's another pandemic or some other crises or not, that people are better supported by our systems.
We need to make sure that we're doing right by Canadians and this crisis has given us not just examples of where we haven't been good enough in the past, as governments, but opportunities to make significant changes.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I absolutely believe that we have to look at owl of our systems to see if we can improve them.
This pandemic has exposed flaws in our system in terms of its treatment of the most vulnerable and it gives us an opportunity to make changes for the better and rebuild our country and systems that will be fairer and more generous towards the most vulnerable.
So, this is a great opportunity for everyone.
If there are other pandemics or if we go back to normal, whatever the situation, we need to do more for vulnerable Canadians.



**Reporter**:

You've said July 8 there will be a fiscal snapshot.
I'm wondering what specifically it will include, what sorts of numbers? and if this is a means to appease the opposition who have been asking for a fiscal update.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past number of months, we have put forward, in full transparency, updated numbers every two weeks to the finance committee on measures that we've put forward.
So, our commitment to transparency has been ongoing as has been the case for this government since the very beginning.
At the same time, it will be useful to pull together all these different measures so people understand the scale of what this country has done.
Some comparors with other countries so we can see how they fit on the spectrum of help to citizens in our peer countries.
We're also a sense of what could be expected in the coming months.
I think it would be a little bit unrealistic to project much further than a few months because things are changing so rapidly.
But we're happy to continue to demonstrate the kind of transparency and accountability that Canadians expect and deserve.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I think it will be a good idea, and interesting to bring together all the information at the finance department with respect to our investments and the resources we're providing to Canadians.
At the same time, it will be a chance to compare ourselves to other countries to see where we are with respect to our support for Canadians.
and it will also give people an idea of what the next weeks or months could hold.
Without necessarily providing long-term predictions and we continue to focus on transparency.



**Reporter**:

It was said that you have no respect for parliament and you are doing nothing for Quebec.
I'd like to get your response to that.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we know, this is a minority parliament.
Decisions about whether parliament sits and how we move forward need to be made on a consensus or on a majority basis in the parliament, which is why number of weeks ago, we worked with other parties and got an agreement to continue to focus on the COVID-19 crisis but expand the roles to ensure that we have accountability moments in time for the parliament to return throughout this summer, including on July 8 where we'll be presenting a fiscal update.
So, you know, three different parties came together to make a determination of what parliament would do. That is how parliament functions.
I can understand that both the bloc qu√âb√âcois and the conservatives did not want this particular outcome, but the will of parliament was expressed by a majority, by the three parties who came together to determine what we're doing.
That is how parliament works.
Every time something doesn't go their way and the opposition party cries it's a dictatorship is somewhat irresponsible and undermines the strength of democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis.
and strengths of institutions that continue to do really important work, not just to help Canadians during this crisis, but to remain accountable and engaged in our democratic processes.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I think it's extremely important to point out that the current situation in parliament was debated and voted on by the majority of parliamentarians.
There are three parties that came together to determine that, yes, we were going to have a COVID-19 committee broaden question period so that more parliamentarians could ask questions on any issue and come back four times during the summer, including in July, for this economic snapshot.
Age think that is the way a parliament is supposed to work.
a minority parliament in that type of minority parliament, no party alone can decide how things will work.
We need to collaborate and the sfakt -- and the fact is that a majority of members of parliament agreed with that approach.
Unfortunately, the bloc qu√âb√âcois and the conservatives were not happy with that conclusion, they didn't like the majority decision of parliament.
But if every single time that someone doesn't get what they want in a minority parliament, they start to say well this is nothing but a dictatorship, I think that is a bit ridiculous, first of all.
and second of all, it undermines the people's confidence, the confidence people should have in our institutions that are serving Canadians very, very well.
Now we brought in four bills in the last few months to help Canadians and we have also shown just how well our democracy and our institutions are continuing to operate.
That should re-assure Canadians that even in a crisis we're working very well as a democracy.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Radio-Canada.
With respect to a seat on the u. N. security council, you have invested a great deal personally in this, a lot of political capital.
You've said Canada is back.
What happens if we lose? what if you don't get that permanent seat? do you believe it will be your fault personally?



**>> Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Well, for the last five years, Canada has been much more deeply engaged in the world.
Whether it's through our initiatives in Paris on climate change, whether it's in the g-7 or whether it's in protecting our oceans and addressing sexual equality in the world, in our work and many multilateral institutions has shown that Canada continues to be deeply engaged in developing priorities for ourselves and for developing countries.
Particularly developing countries that need more funding and better institutions in a situation such as this.
So Canada is working very well within the multilateral system and has been for the last five years.
The seat on the u. N. security council is an additional means of ensuring that our voice will be heard.
Our actions will continue, whatever the result, in the coming day.
We know that an engaged Canada is good for the rest of the world.
But it is also good for Canadians.
It's in our own interests to have stable and predictable rules around the world.
It's in our own interests to have support out there for vulnerable people through education and economic progress for people around the world.
Because Canada succeeds when everyone else in the world succeeds.
That is what we've been doing for five-year and that is what we'll continue to do. Whether we're on the security council or not.
If we are there, it will be easier to have our voice heard, but our engaged approach will not change.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think one of the things we've seen over the past five years is Canada has stepped up on the world stage, whether it has been on the fight against climate change, through our oceans and through support for small island developing states as well as climate financing internationally, whether it has been on women, peace and security on our impacts on the new Vancouver principles, on peacekeeping.
Whether it's moving forward on financing for development with developing countries, looking at our international financial institutions that threaten wood structures that have lasted and kept us so well for 75 years.
But need to be modified.
Canada has continued to be a strong voice on the world stage because this is what Canada does well and we will continue to do it. Yes, a seat on the u. N. security council will be an additional lever and extra way that Canada can make sure that our voice and our values are being heard at the highest levels.
But we will continue to make a difference in the world and defend multilateral ism not just because it is good for the world but because it's good for Canadians.
Canadians do well when we are connected to the world, when we're trading with the world.
When there are clear rules in place for things like interings -- international trade and international behaviours.
We do well when countries come together to work collaboratively to solve big problems.
We do well when vulnerable people around the world have better opportunities to succeed and fewer conflicts and fewer social inequities.
These are the things that Canada has been doing for the past five years.
These are the things that we'll don't do into the future, regardless of what happens this week.
But it certainly would be nice to be able to have that extra level of -- lever of a seat on the security council.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I was asking if part of it would be your own fault if you don't get a seat.
Now under the long-term care facilities, the soldiers have been there, there have been problems there.
is there an agreement with Quebec now? how many volunteers from the canadian red cross will be going in there.
Can you clearly explain what is happening? it's important to know what's occurring in these homes.
I can tell you that we have been continuing our very productive discussions with Quebec.
There's always a lot of great collaborations between the federal government and Quebec.
and we'll have announcements to make on that very soon.



**Reporter**:

This fiscal snapshot that you are releasing, if you are doing this, does this mean that the big spending announcements have now all been made and, if not, how reliable will this be? also when do you think you'll be in a position to actually put forward a fiscal update or a budget?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all, we know that we are moving through the emergency phase right now, into something that is more of a recovery phase.
We will continue to monitor what is needed in the economy as we go forward on extending certain programmes, on modifying others.
But as we've been doing from the beginning, we'll keep adjusting as we go. I think it is useful to bundle together all the initiatives and all the ways we've helped Canadians over the past months in one concrete snap shot in a few weeks.
But, of course, we recognize that if there is a second wave, if Canadians fall on hard times because of COVID-19 in the coming months, we'll need to do more.
We are going to remain focused on making sure that Canadians are able to get through this in the best possible way, to be able to keep ourselves and our families safe but also to be able to make sure we have a strong economy going forward.
So, yes, now is a natural time for bundling together everything that we'ves done with this fiscal snapshot.
But certainly as we move forward, we will continue to be transparent about decisions big and small we have to take to continue to keep Canadians safe.
As for when there will be a full fiscal update or an eventual budget, you know, right now we're still very much responding to an immediate situation and we will don't reflect on when that time could be right as the situation stabilizes.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Of course, we are moving now from the emergency to a re-opening economy so it's perfectly logical that we should provide information about all the measures we've brought in over the last few months.
Now that does not mean that there will not be other initiatives introduced if there is a second wave or if we need to extend certain programmes.
But it is logical to share a picture of where we are now in Canada with Canadians.
With respect to the next steps, a budget or a more formal economic update, we continue to look at the situation and when the economy is stable enough to do that, we will.



**Reporter**:

and you asked us this earlier, I'd like to give you another opportunity to answer.
How much do you have personally riding on this u. N. security council vote?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think this is something that Canadians expect for us to be involved in the world and I've certainly seen the impact that Canada can have on the world stage through the g7 and g-20 at a time when there are large countries withdrawing a little bit from the global stage.
I believe deeply that Canada can and should be stepping up ton world stage and demonstrated that Canadians can and do have a large impact on the world when we do that over the past five years.
I certainly look forward to being able to continue that.
I do see that the u. N. security council seat could be a very powerful tool for continuing what we're doing.
As I said from the beginning, a seat on the u. N. security council is not an end to in itself.
It's a means to continue ensuring that our values and our voice and that our solutions are heard and resonating at all levels of multilateralism.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

As I noted many time, a seat on the u. N. security council is not an end to itself, it's a means of an end.
a way to ensure that Canadian values and solutions can continue to resonate on the world stage.
I think people have seen just what kind of positive impact Canada's had on the world in the last five years.
and I hope to continue that with a seat on the security council.
However, whatever the result of the vote is, we'll continue to be there and to be engaged with the rest of the world because it is good for Canadians to have a more stable world where people follow the rules.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, you listed many things Canada has done internationally, on the world stage.
But we know that for members -- u. N. members voting today on the security council seat, two key factors are commitments to peacekeeping and the percentage of g. D.p. Dedicated to foreign a. How do you think Canada has done on those two measures compared to the two countries we're competing against?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there is always more to do and we're always looking at how Canada can better help, how Canada can best help on the world stage.
But right now what we're seeing in the world is challenges to the multi will the -- multilateral system with large countries withdrawing their support for engagement on the world stage.
It is time for medium-sized countries who can have a big voice to step up and that is why Canada's seat on -- Canada's voice on the u. N. security council could be a strong lever for continuing the defence of the multilateral system we're in and improvements to that multilateral system.
I have nothing but respect for our two competitors , ireland and norway, that have demonstrated an engagement in the world.
There is no question about it. It is unfortunate we're in a situation to have to compete against friends for this.
But I know that Canada has a particular ability to convene voices from around the world, to move forward in ways that are connected to testify country around the world through our diaspora, a voice that is consistent and strong in its values and it's really necessary on the world stage right now.
We need to have strong voices that are there to speak for others, not just for themselves and Canada has consistently done that and that's why I AM optimistic about the process we're in.







**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Ok. 



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I think it is important to say that Canada has a special contribution to make with its diversity and international engagement.
We're big enough to make a difference but small enough to know that we cannot do everything alone.
That is our strength and has been for many years.
Certainly Ireland and Norway are allied countries and they have had a very positive impact on the world.
But Canada has a special strength to contribute, which is either -- even greater than those two countries, through our membership in the g-7, the g-20, the francophone, the commonwealth, the organization of American states, etc.
and OPEC.
We have been present at so many different tables that we're able to bring people together.
To ensure that a positive voice can be heard, a voice that often is not heard because sometimes the large countries are more worried about themselves than others.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] the nhl's return to play provided agreement from the local authorities.
But the 14-day quarantine for people crossing the United States-Canada border is still a limiting step toward that and the same rule that's kept people from going to funerals, weddings.
What do you propose with regards to hockey player.
Are you going to create them as an essential worker or a waiver to allow them to enter the country without the 14-day quarantine?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we'll be making announcements around this at the appropriate time, but we're working with local health authorities, provincial health authorities and the nhl to make sure that, regardless of the measures in place, Canadians are kept safe and our focus is on community safety throughout.
There are ways that we can ensure that the principles are respected in a way that make sense for the nhl and those are what the conversations with.
As I said, we're open to making arrangements as long as the principles of keeping Canadians safe first and foremost and preventing the spread of COVID-19 are respected.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I think that even if we'd all like to see some hockey played this summer, we have to focus on the principle of protecting Canadian and preventing the spread of COVID-19. That is why we have been working with the NHL and provincial authorities and local authorities on measures that will make it possible for the NHL to play, knowing that at every step of the way, we will not be risking the health of Canadians.
Merci.beaucoup.
