### Summary:


I want to talk about our work onthe file.
The bid was certainly one way toachieve this, but it's far from the only way.
Moving forward, Canadians can count on us to keep working withour partners to make progress internationally on issues that matter to them.
Even though Canada is not part of that group, I would like to take a moment to talk about the work that we established in thatarea.
As Canadians know, we have been working on this for four years. and to build a sustainable peace and make concrete progress on issues thatare important to Canada, and that's exactly what we did during the campaign.
Today, more than ever, global cooperation is critical, not only to defeat the virus, but also to meet the major challenges of our time, challenges that know no borders.
We will be working with partners, and we must if we wantto fight climate change, bring in sustainable peace, advance gender equality and protect our own citizens.
Securing a seat was never an endin itself but rather a way of getting to our goals, a way of ensuring that our voice would beheard and our values would be upheld on the global stage. security council was one way of doing that, but it's not the only way.
Canadians can always rely on us to continue to work with our partners to advance the issues of importance to us. [ end of interpretation ]across the country we're starting to reopen parts of the economy, and that's welcome newsfor everyone, but as we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures so that we don't lose the progress we've made.
Some people start -- as some people start heading back to work, testing and contact tracing is crucial.
That's why we've been working with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have everything they need to keep people safe and healthy.
Led by the canadian digital service, and with the help of shopify, blackberry and the government of Ontario, we have been working on a nationwide mobile app that will notify users if they've been exposed tocovid-19. We will soon begin testing this app in Ontario.
There are already a number of other provinces, including British Columbia, who are working with us on this, but it will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
Premier ford will have more to say on how the app will work in Ontario later today, but I want to thank him and his government for their leadership and partnership.
It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not, but theapp will be most effective when as many people as possible have it. Here's how it's gonna work.
If you test positive for COVID-19, a health care professional will help you upload your status anonymously to a national network.
Other users who have the app andhave been in proximity to you will then be alerted that they have been exposed to someone who's tested positive.
Led by canadian digital service in cooperation with shopify, blackberry and the government ofontario, we are developing a mobile application to be used all across Canada that will inform users if they have been exposed to COVID-19.
a number of provinces, includingbritish columbia, are already working with us, and the application will be available right across the country in the coming days.
Now this is how it's going to work.
If you receive a positive COVID-19 test, a health care professional will help you upload your status anonymously to a national network.
Since the beginning of this crisis, our government has been there for artists, creators and the people who work in that industry.
So our government decided to make a new investment of $25.7 million to maintain almost 200 jobs in seven museums, national museums across the country.
The people who work in those institutions preserve our canadian heritage.
[ end of interpretation ]since the beginning of this crisis, our government has been closely monitoring the spread ofthe virus, its impacts on our economy and making the right adjustments along the way.
