# News before the Speech



Suppress it and control it. This is happening as we reach in this country a new pandemic milestone.
Canada has now surpassed 100, 000cases of the virus.
Of course many of those cases already recovered, but significant nonetheless.
Also in this city today we are following the reaction from the bloc leader, yves-fran√áois blanchet.
He is calling today for a sincere apology from NDP leader jagmeet singh who yesterday, youmight know, called one of the bloc's M.P.s a racist in the the house of commons yesterday.
There was a motion on the table by the NDP to look at systemic racism inside the RCMP, as well as a series of other measures.
Singh says that bloc M.P. alan therrien not only said no to supporting the motion but gestured in a dismissive way at which point singh called therrien a racist and he was subsequently expelled from the house of commons for the rest ofthe day.
He later gave a fairly emotionalpress conference to talk about why he had reacted in that way, but they still remain at odds over what happened and whether or not there should be an apology.
Here now the Prime Minister of Canada.
