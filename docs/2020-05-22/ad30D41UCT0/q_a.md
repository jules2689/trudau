# Q & A



**(Question by Media)**:

On another topic, parliament is expected to return on Monday.
It has been suggested that the parliament be able to sit and discuss many other issues.
So do you degree that it's time to expand parliament's activities, and should MPs be able to address any subject other than the pandemic?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

First of all, we're in a situation where the pandemic has become our everyday reality for all Canadians.
and we have to take action and respond accordingly, and of course there's no doubt that that is our priority as a government.
We want to be there to help Canadians during this crisis, but it's also the priority of all parliamentarians.
But there are conversations occurring right now with the different parties in the house of commons to see how we can return to work and how we should do that.
Canadians know full well that we need a functioning parliament during this crisis, and that's exactly what we're seeking to do.



Operator?



Thank you.
Merci.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
For a number of weeks, you've been talking about the importance of doing more testing, and yet in another -- in a number of clinics, the number of tests is not very significant, even in the greatermontreal region.
So what do you say to Canadians who are hesitating to go and gettested?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Well, we need to do much more testing.
That is how we will be able to control the reopening of the economy and control the spread of the virus.
That's important.
and I know that the provinces may have different approaches tothis, but they do need to ramp up the pace of testing, and a number of provinces are now expanding the Sep -- scope of their testing protocols so that anyone who wants to get tested can.
But it can also be important to ramp up the contact tracing as well, and encourage people who may be infected with COVID-19 to get tested as well.



a follow-up?



**(Question by Media)**:

Yes.
Now do you consider that immigration levels should stay the same? I think it's important to understand that we have pawed our economy for the time being.
There are a lot of people that have to stay home and cannot work.
But as soon as the economy starts up again, we will need workers.
I know and I'm confident that the Canadian economy will rebound.
and new comers to this country are an important part of the growth that we're going to have in this country.
We will have to set the immigration levels at a responsible threshold but give proper opportunities both to Canadians and people coming fromabroad.
New comers create jobs in Canada.
That has always been the case, and it will still be the case infuture.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Next question, national post.
Line open.



**(Question by Media)**:

Yeah, good morning, sir.
I'm wondering now that the negotiations are ongoing over the reopening of parliament, which is set to start on Monday.
I'm wondering what your positionis, what your... do you want the(inaudible) to continue, do you want to see some sort of larger parliament? some sort of hybrid model?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

I think we want what Canadians want, to make sure there is a functioning parliament that will ensure that questions and preoccupations from across the country get heard.
There are certainly noncovid things we could be moving forward on. I think the focus will always need to be on this exceptional situation we're in, and our government and our country's response to that.
Those discussions continue to beongoing, and I know that all parties are united in wanting to ensure that we continue, as we have been, to demonstrate that our democracy is strong and our institutions are functioning, not just despite the crisis, but because of the crisis.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

Of course there are a number of issues that we will have to discuss in the coming weeks.
Not all of them are directly linked to COVID-19. But the priority will be the crisis in which we are now involved.
and we will continue those discussions with the other political parties because Canadians want a functioning parliament.
For a number of weeks now, wove been sitting three times a week, and we will continue to get the work done, so that we're making the right decisions for Canadians right across the country.
[ end of interpretation ]



Thank you.
Next question.



**(Question by Media)**:

Yeah, I'm just wondering, sir, do you envision an end to the virtual parliament? more sessions in person? do you see some sort of hybrid model? what do you physically expect parliament to see in the coming weeks, and do you think it should be expanded into the summer?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

These are conversations that are ongoing between all party leaders.
Obviously we will be physically present in reduced numbers regardless of what the final decision is by all parties.
There will have to be a wait for parliamentarians across the country to express the concerns and ask questions on behalf of their constituents.
These are the kinds of things we're working out and I know just as we have been able to sit over the past weeks thee times a week and continue the functioning of our parliament, we will be able to continue that into the coming weeks.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

Just as we were able to respond to questions and ensure that Canada right across the country are properly represented in parliament in recent weeks, we will continue to work to ensure that our democracy is functioning properly in the coming weeks.
[ end of interpretation ]



Thank you, Merci.
Next question, the Canadian press.
Line open.



**(Question by Media)**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Just on a contact tracing, can you provide the timelines that you are -- that your government is going to make sure that all these separate efforts in provinces are actually assisted, not slowdowned, and the government is it ting making surethere's a national effort to ramp up testing?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We know part of the reopening of the economy will involve Canadians travelling more within their provinces and potentially across the country.
That's why we need to have a national approach that is going to be able to have comparable data right across the country and comparable tools.
Even in regions where the spread of the virus is -- seems very much under control right now, there could be a resurgence.
and when that happens, we need to be able to respond quickly and comprehensively, and that's very much what the federal government is working on. We know and we've heard from provinces that contact tracing is a challenge in terms of delivering the bodies necessary to make the phone calls to trace everyone a positive test could have been in contact with in the previous days, that's why we've put forward the logistical support to be able to deliver that to any province across the country.



Follow-up.



**(Question by Media)**:

As My follow-up, I want to go to something else.
Last week the premier of Nova Scotia said he was wait and see whether ottawa is willing to hold a public inquiry into the mass shooting in his province.
So very simply, Prime Minister, will you commit that your government will lead an independent public inquiry into the shooting?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

I think people have many questions about what happened in Nova Scotia, and we're encouraging the RCMP to do its work on the initial investigation, but as we move forward, there will of course be larger questions to ask, and we will work with the government of nova Scotia on getting those answers.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

We know the RCMP will continue to conduct its investigation on exactly what happened in Nova Scotia.
But of course there will be morequestions, and the government ofcanada is perfectly prepared to work with the government of novascotia to find answers to those questions.



Voice of interpreter:



**(Question by Media)**:

Salimah shivji, CBC.
I'm asking about contact tracing.
If only Ontario has signed on and not Quebec, how does that square with the immediate improvement you were talking about earlier and is the message of urgency being lost here?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We have been reaching out over the past week to all provinces to determine what their plan is on contact tracing, what exactly they are doing, and whether or not they need more help.
They have highlighted that we have more resources that can be deployed immediately.
They've been in place for a while.
and we certainly hope to hear back from the provinces that could need this quickly to tell us whether and how they want us to help.
a number of provinces have.
Some have not yet.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

For a number of days we have been telling the provinces that we have valuable resources, and we ask them directly what their plans are with the contact tracing and what their capacity is, and whether they need help or want more resources to do that.
a number of provinces answered, and some have not yet responded to that.
But we hope to be able to help right across the province -- thecountry, particularly in those areas that need help.
[ end of interpretation ]



(question by media):... google has said their platforms will require one app per country.
There's a need for this to happen quickly, obviously.
We've been awaiting an announcement on this for weeks.
People need to download the app.
Will Ottawa step in and impose one app for provinces to use to make digital testing as efficient as possible?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Around the world there have been a number of different apps developed, Singapore, Australia, other places.
One of the challenges that those apps have encountered is that it has to sit in the foreground of your phone and drains the battery.
That's why the fix that apple and google are talking about bringing in in the beginning of June will be extremely important as a base for an effective contact tracing or exposure notification app.
We are working with a number of different partners on potential apps.
We're working closely with apple and google on the update that they will be bringing forward.
and it is our expectation that when the time comes for that to be released, we will be able to recommend strongly to Canadians a particular app that will help us manage the spread of COVID-19. 

[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

The applications that have been developed around the world to fight COVID-19 would be improved if they incorporate a change that apple and google are now making in their systems.
This is something that should be released in June, and we are hoping to be able to recommend an application to Canadians at that time so that we can help to control the spread of the virus.

**(Question by Media)**:

Again gregoire, CTV news.
Prime Minister, I want to ask about the situation in Hong Kong.
You know the Chinese government is considering very serious security legislation that's going to really change the situation on the ground there for at least for the 300, 000 Canadians who are there now.
and it could very likely end the one country, two systems arrangement that they've had fora while.
What's your message to Beijing now, and would you consider any kind of sanctions or any formal diplomatic rebuke if the government proceeds with this?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We are concerned with the situation in Hong Kong.
We have 300, 000 Canadians who live in Hong Kong, and that's one of the reasons why we want to ensure that the one country, two systems approach continues for Hong Kong.
We have long called for a deescalation of tensions and genuine dialogue with Hong Kong -- between Hong Kong citizens and Beijing.
We continue to call for that, and we will keep monitoring the situation closely.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

We're very concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and have been for a long time.
There are 300, 000 Canadians living there.
and the approach of one country and two systems that's been in place in Hong Kong continues to be very important.
We have made it clear to beijingthat it's very important to pursue that dialogue with the citizens of Hong Kong and to reduce the tensions there.
[ end of interpretation ][ please stand by ]



My question for you is what are you doing to protect us -- can you tell us anything about the breaches that have taken place so far and are you going to build an international coalition to confront china?



**Answer**:

We have long been concerned about intellectual properties in Canada.
That's why we have increased the funding for the c. S.c., which isthe communications security establishment, which watches andmakes sure our systems are safe.
The c. S.c. is among the best intelligence agencies in the world, and we're working with partners around the world like five eyes and others.
We will make sure they have the tools to keep Canadians and our institutions safe.
Part of that involves notifying, but part of that includes working to keep Canadians' data and safety protected.
We will continue to ensure they have is the tools to do their work.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
You are now negotiating with the opposition parties for the suspension of work.
Now, with respect to the CERB, is that part of your negotiations? the bloc is asking you to introduce a more progressive model to allow or to encourage people to return to work.
is that part of what your plans are and when do you expect to make a decision on this?



**Answer**:

Well, I think there are two parts of this negotiation when it comes to the return of parliament.
We are focusing on the structure that will allow all Canadians right across the country to be properly represented in a parliament that will be limited in terms of people there in person and others who will be participating by video conference.
The other issue has to do with technology and logistics decisions related to the return of parliament.
Now, there are parties making suggestions and recommendations to improve some of the programs that are there for Canadians, in order to better help Canadians and businesses in this crisis.
That's what we continue to work on with them.
But we prefer to separate the discussions on the return to parliament from those with respect to amending specific policies.
[end of translation] there are two things that are being discussed that are a little bit blended in some people's views that we tend to keep a little more separate.
There are reflections on how parliament is coming back, how we will ensure that our institutions and our democracy continues to function strongly as it has over the past several weeks with three sessions a week.
We are going to keep working to bring forward new issues.
There is the other reflection on proposals and suggestions made by other parties on how to improve the benefits we're sending to Canadians, how to facilitate the reopening of the economy, and those conversation swill continue on a separate track.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] yesterdayfranÇois legault said he was competing with the CERB and this is harming the ability of people to return to work.



**Answer**:

Well, we're in a situation where millions of Canadians have no jobs, where tens of millions of students were relying on a summer job this year in order to pay their rent or pay their tuition will not have a summer job.
We need to be there to support people who need help.
That's exactly what we're doing.
The unemployment rate among young people is close to 35%. young people want to work, they want to contribute, but they want to receive the necessary support.
That's why we brought in the emergency student benefit.
[end of translation] we know that millions of Canadians are off work right now and tens of thousands of students who were relying on summer jobs to be able to pay for their groceries, rent, tuition fees won't find those summer jobs.
We need to make sure we're supporting those students so they can continue in their path to higher education and continue to contribute to society.
I know lots of young people want to contribute.
That's why we're creating more jobs, more opportunities for them to develop experience.
We also needed to make sure that they were supported during this summer of unemployment and that's exactly what we've done.

**Question**:

The number of cases of COVID-19 among military members helping in Ontario and Quebec in long-term care homes has doubled in the last week.
Why is the military not receiving hazard pay when they are clearly at risk?



**Answer**:

These are discussions ongoing in the military.
We need to thank the men and women of the armed forces stepping up when they are called on to go into difficult or risky situations to do the work to protect Canadians.
This is what they are doing.
We thank them and salute them.

**Question**:

You've had several calls to speak to the u. N. seat.
What is Canada offering, vote for other candidates? what will you offer Arab countries this afternoon for their support and what did you offer other countries for their support?



**Answer**:

From the beginning Canada has framed their engagement with the security council smart serve a means to end.
We have to see how we see multilateral ism around the world to improve the situation across borders to contributing to a better world moving forward.
Canada brings this front forward.
We are big to make a difference on the council, but small enough not to do it alone.
We want to represent the planet within our own population and make that diversity and difference a source of strength not just in Canada but our multilateral organizations.
Canadians have an important voice that needs to be heard on the u. N. security council going forward.
 [voice of interpreter] the u. N. security council and a seat there is not a goal in itself.
It's an opportunity for Canadians to continue to have a positive impact on the world.
We deeply believe in multiculturalism and during this crisis we need to come out together.
We want countries that use proper values and principles and we want proper diversity around the planet as well so we can work together on climate change, on our economic investments in developing countries or on technology and science.
We have a role to play and Canadians on the security council will have a positive impact on the world as a whole.
That's what I tell people when is peak to other world leaders.
As we also talk about challenges associated with climate change and COVID-19 that are also on the agenda during these conversations.
Thank you all very much.
