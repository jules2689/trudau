# PM Trudeau Speech



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Hello, everyone.
This morning we awoke to terrible news coming out of Pakistan.
Pakistan international airlines plane carrying over 100 passengers crashed in a residential neighbourhood in kurachi.
My heart goes out to all the victims and their families.
Our thoughts are with Pakistan today.
We're starting a bit earlier this morning, because we have a cabinet meeting early this afternoon, so thank you all for joining us now.
Last night, the premiers and I held our 10th weekly call since the beginning of the crisis.
We talked about what's been on everyone's mind lately, how we can safely reopen the economy.
Over the past few months, Canadians have been doing a great job of staying at home, maintaining fanned, and listening to public health advice.
and that means we can restart some activities.
We're not out of the woods yet.
COVID-19 remains a serious health threat.
We have to proceed with caution and keep listening to science or we risk losing the progress we've made.
So today I want to outline what we know needs to happen to successfully reopen the economy and adjust to our new normal.
First, we need to continue scaling up our testing capacity so we can quickly identify new cases and isolate them.
We're working with provinces and territories to expand testing by procuring things like reagents and swabs.
While some provinces have the capacity to meet their current needs.
We're collaborating to ramp up testing so we can protect Canadians and effectively manage future out-uberx.
Second, we need to accelerate our ability to do contact tracing.
After we've confirmed and isolated new cases, we have to get in touch with everyone who may have been exposed to the virus and make sure they take measures to quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms or get tested.
While provinces and territories are managing testing and contacttracing differently, our government has trained federal employees who can make 3600 contact tracing calls a day, 7 days a week.
Statistics Canada has also an additional 1700 interviewers ready to go who can make up to 20, 000 calls a day.
These federal resources are available to assist provinces and territories with any surges or backlogs or challenges they have in contact tracing.
We're already helping to make calls in Ontario and stand readyto help anywhere else.
Third, we have to ensure the data collected across jurisdictions is shared between province and is territories.
This will help us track the spread of the virus, adapt our response accordingly, and save lives.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

I want to talk about what we need to do to ensure a successful reopening of the economy and an adjustment to the new reality.
First, we must continue to increase our testing capacity so that we can quickly detect and isolate any new cases.
Second, we must be able to quickly contact people who have been exposed, so that they can self-isolate and monitor their symptoms or get tested.
While the provinces and territories are conducting testing and doing their contact tracing a little differently, our government has trained federal employees who are now prepared to step up and help find people who have been exposed to the virus across the country.
These employees can make 3600 calls a day, 7 days a week.
Furthermore, statistics Canada has made available 1700 interviewers who can make up to 20, 000 calls a day.
We are already making those calls in Ontario, and we are offering our assistance to anyone who needs it. Third, we have to ensure that the data collected by the provinces and territories are shared right across the country.
That will help us to follow the spread of the virus to adapt ourresponse accordingly, and to save lives.

**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Now, Canada is a vast country, and some regions have been hit harder than others by the pandemic.
That's why plans to relax restrictions vary from one jurisdiction to another.
But in order for people to move around freely and start getting back to normal life, we have to improve our ability to quickly pinpoint the virus and isolate it. All premiers recognize how important this is, and I want to thank them for their engagement in this issue.
Since the beginning of this crisis, all jurisdictions have been working towards one common goal, protecting Canadians.
The next fizz of our collaborative efforts is on testing, contact tracing, and data collection, and I've told the premiers that the federal government is here to support, facilitate, and fund this important work.
Taking strong, collaborative action to expand testing and contact tracing is important for both Canadians and businesses to have confidence we're on the right foot.
We need to know we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is routed in science, evidence, and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

In order for people to be able to move around freely again and get back to their usual routine, we must be able to quickly detect and isolate any new cases.
All premiers understand just how important that is, and we agree.
From the beginning of this crisis, all orders of government have been working together to protect Canadians.
The next phase of our collaboration will focus on testing, contact tracing, and data sharing.
and as I said to My colleagues right across the country, the federal government will be thereto support, facilitate, and fund that work.
It's important for Canadians as it is for businesses to know that we are cooperating in order to step up the testing and contact tracing.
The last few months have been very difficult for everyone.
Because we are going through a period of uncertainty, and life was turned upside down overnight.
But we put in place certain measures to help people get through the crisis, whether you're a student, a retiree, or unemployeed.
and if you need help or you're not sure where to begin, we now have a new online tool that can help you go to Canada.
Ca/coronavirusbenefits to get more information.
You can answer a couple of questions, and the tool will give you a list of programs you are eligible for.
[ end of interpretation ]



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We set up a number of programs to help everyone from students to parents to seniors get through this crisis.
If you need support but you're not quite sure where to start, we now have a new online tool to help you.
Just go to Canada.
Ca/coronavirusbenefits.
You'll find a list of a few simple questions, and the tool will generate an array of programs for which you may be eligible.
I want to close today by addressing the significant increase in acts of racism against asian Canadians.
Over the past few weeks and months, businesses, buildings, and statues have been vandalized.
People have been verbally abusedand physically attacked.
It's unacceptable.
Hate, violence, and discrimination have no place in Canada.
This is not who we are as Canadians.
I want to thank those who stood up against violence and exposed what is happening in our community.
We need to speak out against racism wherever it is found so we can stop it. The asian Canadians across the country know that we all stand with you.
We will not let hate divide us.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone for questions.
Operator?



Thank you.
Merci.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to talk about the contact tracing and testing.
You did discuss this in your conversation with the premiers.
and I would like to know whether you arrived on an agreement on national contact tracing strategy, and did that include using mobile applications for contact tracing.
and if so, are we talking about voluntary use or what exactly?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Now, right across the country we now have the ability to conduct 60, 000 tests a day.
But we are not yet at that point.
Because a number of regions do not need to increase the pace of their testing because the situation there is more under control.
and in other regions, we will be there to support, providing the necessary materials.
We talked to the provinces last evening, and we've been talking to them for a number of weeks now to find out what their specific testing needs are and also what they need to do to increase their contact tracing.
As I said, we have set you have a network of public servants that are prepared to help the provinces with their testing, but the first step is really understanding what the needs are and what the plans are in every province and territory.
and worry working very closely with Ontario now on contact tracing and we will be there to help any other province or territory that requires assistance.
We just need them to ask us what could be done to increase the pace of that testing and contacttracing.
With respect to applications, we're continuing to work on that and we'll have more to say on that in the coming days.


[ end of interpretation ]



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We are from the very beginning highlighted how important it is to increase testing capacity.
We have currently testing capacity around 60, 000 tests a day, but that capacity hasn't been reached yet anywhere in the country because we have a number of provinces that don't have to augment all that much their testing capacity because things are under control, but everyone needs to be ready in case there is a surge, which is why we're moving forward on ensuring that there is that testing capacity and we continue to ramp it up. In regards to contact tracing, we know that is an essential element as we move forward.
We're working very closely with Ontario.
We've developed a public service approach federally that is thereto support the mechanisms in the province to do that contact tracing, and we're ramping it up. But we also are there, obviously, to help any other province that would need help with contact tracing.
We've asked provinces to highlight for us what your plans are and how we can help with that.
In regards to the app, we continue to work on that and hopefully have things to share in the coming days or weeks.
