### Summary:


First, we need to continue scaling up our testing capacity so we can quickly identify new cases and isolate them.
We're working with provinces and territories to expand testing by procuring things like reagents and swabs.
While some provinces have the capacity to meet their current needs.
We're collaborating to ramp up testing so we can protect Canadians and effectively manage future out-uberx.
Second, we need to accelerate our ability to do contact tracing.
After we've confirmed and isolated new cases, we have to get in touch with everyone who may have been exposed to the virus and make sure they take measures to quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms or get tested.
While provinces and territories are managing testing and contacttracing differently, our government has trained federal employees who can make 3600 contact tracing calls a day, 7 days a week.
These federal resources are available to assist provinces and territories with any surges or backlogs or challenges they have in contact tracing.
We're already helping to make calls in Ontario and stand readyto help anywhere else.
The next fizz of our collaborative efforts is on testing, contact tracing, and data collection, and I've told the premiers that the federal government is here to support, facilitate, and fund this important work.
Taking strong, collaborative action to expand testing and contact tracing is important for both Canadians and businesses to have confidence we're on the right foot.

We set up a number of programs to help everyone from students to parents to seniors get through this crisis.
If you need support but you're not quite sure where to start, we now have a new online tool to help you.



Now, right across the country we now have the ability to conduct 60, 000 tests a day.
Because a number of regions do not need to increase the pace of their testing because the situation there is more under control.
We talked to the provinces last evening, and we've been talking to them for a number of weeks now to find out what their specific testing needs are and also what they need to do to increase their contact tracing.
As I said, we have set you have a network of public servants that are prepared to help the provinces with their testing, but the first step is really understanding what the needs are and what the plans are in every province and territory.
and worry working very closely with Ontario now on contact tracing and we will be there to help any other province or territory that requires assistance.
We just need them to ask us what could be done to increase the pace of that testing and contacttracing.


[ end of interpretation ]



We are from the very beginning highlighted how important it is to increase testing capacity.
We have currently testing capacity around 60, 000 tests a day, but that capacity hasn't been reached yet anywhere in the country because we have a number of provinces that don't have to augment all that much their testing capacity because things are under control, but everyone needs to be ready in case there is a surge, which is why we're moving forward on ensuring that there is that testing capacity and we continue to ramp it up.
We've developed a public service approach federally that is thereto support the mechanisms in the province to do that contact tracing, and we're ramping it up. But we also are there, obviously, to help any other province that would need help with contact tracing.
We've asked provinces to highlight for us what your plans are and how we can help with that.
