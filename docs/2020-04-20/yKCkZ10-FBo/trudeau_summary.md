### Summary:




[end of translation] we are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic, to save lives, and to help each other make it to a better day.
But yesterday we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy in Nova Scotia.
a gunman claimed the lives of at least 18 people.
Among them, a woman in uniform whose job it is to protect lives, even if it endangers her own, Constable Heidi Stevenson of the RCMP.
This happened in small towns, Portapique, Truro, millford, andenfield are people have deep roots, places where people know their neighbours and look out for everyone.
There everyone knows a Mountie because they're everything from social workers to teen counsellors.
Now these communities are in mourning and Canada is in mourning with them.
To the grandparents who lost a child, to the children who lost a parent, to the neighbour who lost a friend, we are so sorry for your loss.
 

[voice of interpreter] yesterday, at least18 people lost their lives aft era shoot-out in Nova Scotia, plunging families and their loved ones in mourning.
Some lost children, some lost a parent, some lost a friend.
We share in your mourning and westand with you and mourn with you as you go through these verypainful times.
I know from coast to coast to coast, the women and men who wear the red surge in service tocanada are grieving deeply the loss of one of their own and one of our best.
This tragedy is a painful reminder of the risks all of ourfirst responders take to keep ussafe, of the sacrifices they mayevery single day to protect our communities, paramedics, doctors, nurses, firefighters, and police officers, they're always here for us. They've been stepping up throughthe pandemic, and yesterday in Nova Scotia they showed that bravery.
I know that can weigh on you at times.


[end of translation] this day ismade all the more difficult because of the precious lives lost and the senseless act of one person. we may never know why.
But we do know this.
Know one man's action can build a wall between us and a better day, no matter how evil, how thoughtless, or how destructive.
The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be heldvirtually to celebrate the livesof the victims on 7:00 p. on Friday, through the facebook group account -- "colchester supporting our community."
I know that people have questions.
Let us instead focus all our attention on the lives we lost and the families and friends whogrieve.
 

[voice of interpreter] while the pandemic will prevent us from gathering and mourning together, a virtualvigil will be held on Friday at 7:00 p.
It will be an opportunity to support the lives of these victims and be there for their families and their loved ones.
Since this tragedy I've had discussions with premier mcneil, the RCMP commissioner brenda lucki, the Minister of public safety bill blair, our Nova Scotia caucus, among other people.
I know people have questions.


[end of translation] I want to address the kids in Nova Scotia and right across the country.
I know the world can seem like amean and ugly place right now, but there is a whole lot of goodin the world too.
