# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Recognizing today marks the 75th anniversary of the battle of the Atlantic as we remember the sailors and soldiers and pilots that helped turn the tide of the second world war, we honor all of our veterans that stepped forward so we may live in peace.
We think of the brave men and women who serve today and mourn the six heroes we lost just last week.
To those loved ones serving on HMS Fredericton and all c. a.f. Members, I want to once again offer My deepest condo lens to Canadians.
Over the last four months, Canada has experienced challenge and heartbreak on a scale we never would have expected.
If you're overwhelmed, that is understandable.
If you need support, that's Ok. ON April, we launched wellness together Canada, a website you can find people to talk to if you are in crisis.
and today we're taking another step forward.
Our government is investing over $240 million to bring health care on-line.
We're expanding existing on-line tools creating new virtual platforms for mental health and for primary care.
Whether you are looking for strategis to manage stress or support from a professional, this will be a resource for you.
If you are part of a marginalized community and need specialized tools, well there will be specific help for you as well.
If we can provide mental health support on-line, there's no reason we can't leverage technology in other areas of health care, too.
This $240 million investment will also include funding for virtual care, for times when you don't need to see a doctor in person.
Just take video conferencing.
By helping doctors run appointments on-line, you can stay safe at home while getting care and our hospitals can stay focused on those who need it most.
If we can use apps to order dinner and video chats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy.




**Interpreter**:

Today, we are announcing an investment of $240 million in on-line care.
With investment to enable us to broaden access to services and provide more reso sources to Canadians.
These funds will be used to create an on-line platform that will provide a whole range of serces related to mental health.
It is also money that will make it possible to provide a broader range of virtual care for times when you don't need to see a doctor in person.
By providing on-line care, we will be reaching more people and reducing the pressure on our health care system.
and since we are all practicing physical distancing these days, this is the right time to invest in these solutions.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

To beat COVID-19, we have to think outside the box.
When Canadian researchers have a solid lead, we need to make sure they can follow it up. That's exactly what we've been doing over the last two months and we're starting to see real results.
Today, I can announce that we're investing over $175 million to support the Canadian company absellera for their very promising COVID-19 research.
They've identified antibodies that could be used in drugs to treat this virus.
This new funding will help them continue their vital work and will support human tries beginning as early as July.
But until we have effective treatments or, better yet a vaccine, we still need a reliable supply of everything from masks to ventilators.
So later today, we'll hear the details of a new COVID-19 supply council.
This council will be tasked with finding innovative solutions to ensure our country continues to have this t vital supplies necessary to keep Canadians safe.
 Rep



**Interpreter**:

There will be research very promising care out by absellera, a Canadian company.
That company is kufrnlly trying to identify antibodies that could be used in the production of medicines to treat the virus.
Our investment will allow the company to continue that research and at the same time will support clinical trials that could begin as early as July.
Later today, Minister Annam will provide additional details regarding the new COVID-19 supply council.
This council will have, as its mandate, to provide innovative solutions to ensure that we have the supplies we need such as masks and hand disinfect tanl.



Prime Minister Trudeau's I want to end today, as I do most sundays, talking to families, to parents.
I know this is a tough time right now to be raising kids.
Right now you should be able to focus on keeping your family safe, not about worrying about the bills.
So, this may, you'll get more help through the Canada child benefit.
When you receive this month's payment, you'll see an extra $300 per child.
For families with two kids, that means an extra $600, for three kids an extra $900 and so on. This is money for whatever you need, whether it is on-line tutoring or groceries.
and to all the kids out there I know things are hard for you, too.
I know you miss your friends and it is not always easy to do your school work on-line.
But this isn't going to last forever.
So, keep planning fun things to do with your friends once this is over.
Keep up on your homework and remember we're going do get through thising to. So, thank you for all of your help around the house, with your parents and sticking together through this difficult time.




**Interpreter**:

If you are a parent, we are going to be putting more money in your pocket this is month.
You will see when your Canada child benefit comes in in a couple of weeks that you will be receiving an additional $300 per child.
That means $600 more for two children, $900 for three children and so on to meet your needs, whether it is for on-line work or groceries.
It is hard these days for families so we are helping parents to make things easier for them.
I know it is also very hard for children.
You miss your friends and you want to be outside or go to the park.
I know that you're anxious to see all of this end.
The good news is we have come a long way in recent weeks but we must continue.
I know it will be difficult.
But if we all continue to help out around the house and remain positive, we will get through this.
If everyone continues to do their part, we will make it. Thank you.
