### Summary:



Recognizing today marks the 75th anniversary of the battle of the Atlantic as we remember the sailors and soldiers and pilots that helped turn the tide of the second world war, we honor all of our veterans that stepped forward so we may live in peace.
Our government is investing over $240 million to bring health care on-line.
We're expanding existing on-line tools creating new virtual platforms for mental health and for primary care.
If we can provide mental health support on-line, there's no reason we can't leverage technology in other areas of health care, too.
This $240 million investment will also include funding for virtual care, for times when you don't need to see a doctor in person.
By helping doctors run appointments on-line, you can stay safe at home while getting care and our hospitals can stay focused on those who need it most.
If we can use apps to order dinner and video chats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy.
Today, I can announce that we're investing over $175 million to support the Canadian company absellera for their very promising COVID-19 research.
This new funding will help them continue their vital work and will support human tries beginning as early as July.
So later today, we'll hear the details of a new COVID-19 supply council.
This council will be tasked with finding innovative solutions to ensure our country continues to have this t vital supplies necessary to keep Canadians safe.
