# Q & A



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
First of all, I'd like a clarification a about the $240 million, since it's about health care.
Will you be transferring that money to the provinces? and also we heard talking -- we heard about evidence regarding the virus and the United States secretary mentioned this this morning.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, that money is for on-line care and mental health services that will be available at various levels and there will be money for provinces as well.
With respect to how and where this virus began, I know it's interesting to find that out.
But our concern is really to ensure that we can help people now.
There will continue to be questions asked and we'll don't look for answers.
But right now our priority in the coming weeks must be to do everything we can to protect Canadians now.
So, should I understand that you did not see that evidence that the americans have been talking about? well, there a number of theories out there and we've heard concerns and hypotheses as to how all of this began.
But right now My priority is how we managed the situation.
After, we can ask those questions and try to find out how this happened.



Prime Minister Trudeau's while this is happening, our focus needs to be on what is happening and how we help it. There will be much time in the coming weeks and months for reflecting on how it happened and how we can prevent it in the future.
But for now, My focus is on how we make sure Canadians get all the help they can right now.



Thank you.
Operator, next question.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, the Canadian press.
Line open.



Yes.
Thank you, Prime Minister.
I just wanted to know if you could speak to a different topic for a second.
Premier Doug ford yesterday suggested that the money for buybacks would be better spend on border security and cracking down on smuggling.
Could you respond to his comments, please?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we know there is more to do on strengthening control in this country which is why we're going to be moving to ward when parliament allows it with stronger measures around.
Borders and safe storage and handguns to permit municipalities to ban hand guns within their city limits.
We know there is more to do. But we also know there is no place in Canada for guns, specifically designed to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.
That is why we are moving forward with a ban on assault -- military-style assault weapons.







**Interpreter**:

We recognize that there is much more to be done to strengthen gun control and that is why we will be introducing legislation when a parliament allows us to do that.
In order to strengthen border controls and introduce other measures with represent to handguns in particular and continue a buyback program for assault-type military weapons.
At the same time, I can say that we realize and know that there is no place for weapons that were in Canada that were invented to kill as many people as in the shortest span of time.
Those assault-style weapons have no place here in Canada and that is why we have banned them.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, sorry.
Tomorrow we'll see a number of provinces, Quebec and Ontario in particular start re-opening their economies.
Do you have any thoughts on the measures that have been announced by some of these provinces, especially Quebec, given that we've seen ongoing increases in the number of COVID-19 cases?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we all, provinces, territories and the federal government, agree on shared principles that we believe in, in terms of opening gradually, carefully and remaining extremely vigilant as different regions take different measures to restart the economy while keeping people safe.
We will support Canadians across the country as we move through these next steps.
Different regions will have different measures to bring in at different times and our job is to make sure we're supporting them as best we can as we go through this carefully and step by step.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

The various provinces will be taking different kinds of action.
We all agreed on basic principles and the conditions that have to be present for a gradual re-opening of society.
and our role as a federal government is to support the provinces in the decisions that they make and to be there to help all Canadians right across this country.
As the various regions begin to re-open, based on their perspective and what they believe to be appropriate.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Now with represent to the introduction of the virus in north America, there is some sources that are saying that we were misled.
Now is it the first of August that you have mentioned? we have always been very clear with various producers across this country and we will try to bring in into effect as soon as possible.
But we did not believe that we could convince the Americans to wait until August 1. So that will happen on July 1, instead.
As I always said, there will be compensation for dairy producers.
It is a very good agreement for all Canadians but we also understand that this is an agreement that will have to result in compensation for dairy producers.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Yes.
If the national hockey league starts up again, will European players be allowed to cross the border, even though they're not Canadian citizen or permanent residents? well, I believe that is something we will have to look at. Now whoever is coming in from another country, will have to follow all the quarantine rules but we are not at that point yet in our discussions with the NHL.
We realize that it is a possibility but will depend on many different factors and I cannot say more at this point as to what will happen until those discussions have been complete.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, Justin Lang, freelance.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning.
I want to follow up on his question about this intelligence assessment.
Fox news is reporting that American intelligence is saying that there is now a growing consensus amongst major intelligence partners that COVID-19 was actually leaked from the Wuhan government lab s. That not your position? if the American government is saying that the consensus is it not incumbent on you to clarify Canada's position given that we are a member of the 5is intelligence partnership.



Prime Minister Trudeau's we have been consuming e -- and cooperating with 5is on various intelligence that's come out on this and other subjects.
We'll don't work with intelligence agencies around the world, not just the 5is but friends and partners as well.
and look to find answers to the many questions people are asking.
But it is still too toller draw firm conclusions and indeed our focus remains on how we are working to protect Canadians, how we are ensuring that Canadians have our entire focus right now and our entire ability to support them through this time.



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

So you say it is too early to draw conclusions, is it fair to infer that Canada has not come to a conclusion that this is from a Chinese lab and is there any investigation being ordered by cs is or c. S.e. To investigate those claims?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we continue to work very closely with our partners and allies and indeed independently on many security issues that are important for Canadians.
At this point, we are not drawing any firm conclusions.



Prime Minister, can you tell us more about the supply council, what will it be focus on and how long is this mandate?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the very beginning, we may it an absolute priority to procure the necessary protective equipment for our front line workers in this country.
We have managed to work with the provinces on sourcing necessary products from around the world so that we've been able to meet the demand across the country.
The same time we recognize that was important to develop our own domestic capacity for P.P.E. and that is coming on-line now.
At the same time, we recognize that as the economy starts to open in different places, in different ways it is going to be difficult to have personal protective equipment in various industries and that is why we need to make sure we're getting the right procurement.
That is why we're working forward with this supply council.



**Reporter**:

and on the re-opening and how P.P.E. Inter plays with that, should Canadians expect to be required to wear masks more frequently as this re-opens? we've already seen on airplanes that masks are now required.
Where else will we see that happen?



Prime Minister Trudeau's what specific rules will be in place will depend on the jurisdiction and the region in which people find themselves.
We see very different realities right across the country.
But certainly social distancing rules will dofnlt apply and using masks in situations where it is more difficult to use full social distancing is going to be very important as well and I'm certain we'll be seeing more people using masks.




**Interpreter**:

The various rules that will be seen across the country will be put in place by local authorities.
But there is no doubt that, as we move forward and we have to continue physical distancing in situations where it may be more difficult to do that, such as on an airplane, well clearly we will be seeing more and more people wearing masks.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, will your government be putting forth any sort of fiscal update this month in terms of new government spending related to COVID-19 and would that include plans to start reducing the deficit?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we're going to continue to stay transparents on the investments we're making to help Canadians through this.
We knew from the very beginning that one of the best ways to keep people safe and healthy was to give them the capacity to socially distance, to stay home, to isolate.
and that meant sending income supports through the Canada emergency response benefit through the wage subsidy, through short -- through loans for small businesses, through many other measures of support for different groups.
We know that the best way to stay healthy is to support Canadians while we go through this difficult time.
We have been ohm and transparent about that every step of the way and we will continue about the investments we'll be making to keep people safe and our economy going.
Our economy was strong before we went into this and we have tremendous confidence in Canadians's ability to come roaring back as we re-open in a gradual way.
and that is why we're comfort about the future of the canadian economy and we will have, of course, more updates and more to say about that as time moves on.



**Reporter**:

With regards to gun control t grandfather clause of these measures seems to allow owners of these guns to apply to keep them in some sort of fashion.
is it really a ban if some people can still keep those guns?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we know that banning military-style assault weapons was an important step in keeping Canadians safe.
That is something that we have done because guns designed to kill the largest amount of people in the smallest amount of time have no place in Canada.
We've brought in a two-year amnesty so that people who have purchased those guns legally will have time to be able to comply with the regulations we are going -- the regulations we brought in and the buyback program and legislation that we're going to move forward with at the first opportunity when the house turns its attention to things other than COVID-19. That means that we are going to keep moving forward on reducing the number of assault weapons in this country.
The details on the buyback program, the details on the rules as to what happens at the end of this amnesty period will be worked out in legislation with other parties, with the stakeholders across the country.
We are going take this very, very seriously because we, as canadian, know are deeply committed to keeping people safe and strengthening gun control in this country.



Prime Minister, Rachel ha ins from CTV national news.
Following up on the gun question.
The day that you announced the gun ban in your election campaign, you first toured around the danforth where a shooting had happened by a handgun.
We know that almost 60% of all firearm-related deaths are because of a handgun.
Why is there still a place for handguns in Canada and what evidence is there that shows that banning the guns that you chose will actually curb gun violence here?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We've seen far too many mass shootings in which military-style assault weapons were used to kill innocent Canadians.
Recently in Nova Scotia, back in ecole polytechnique 30 years ago.
We've seen far too many cases in which these guns have caused devastation to families and communities.
and that is why it was time to ban them.
This is something that we were able to do through regulation.
So it didn't require legislation.
But new measures that we intend to bring in on allowing cities the ability to restrix handgun use and handgun ownership is going to be brought in as we work on legislation as the house turns itself to measures other than COVID-19 and we know there is going to be broad support across political partis to do just that.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

We took concrete action now to limit access to assault-style weapons because there's been far too many massacres and innocent victims that lost their lives because of the use of those weapons in the last 30 years.
I -- it was high time to take action on this but there is more to be done.
That is why giving cities and municipalities the ability to ban handguns in the months to come will be important and working on legislation to do that.
With political partis that agree with us and various groups anxious to see more gun control in this country.



**Reporter**:

Can you tell us about the spartan cube test seback? there are provinces, including Quebec, that have purchased these.
They are set to re-open starting tomorrow.
Concerns do you have or what does this mean moving forward if provinces are relying on this to ramp up their testing to re-open?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we said from the very begining that we needed to move very, very quickly.
We moved quickly on economic measures.
We've also accelerated the testing, the approval, the processes by which we can get a potentially life saving measures out there to Canadians.
But when we do that quickly, there are going new facts that come in and a situations that evolve to require shifts in our postures.
That is why we we will be as nimble as we can to what's working.
and we will always need to adjust every step of the way as new information comes in on a daily basis through this pandemic, through this crisis.
Similarly, provinces will have to adjust to new realities and adjust to successes and challenges as they come up. We know that one of things that Canadians expect us to do is react quickly as new information comes in. and new understanding gets gleaned and that is exactly what we'll do.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

French we knew from the beginning that we would have to take quick action in this emergency and this crisis to ensure that we were doing everything we could told protect Canadians and that is exactly what we did by investing and looking at new ways of saving lives.
But when you move quickly, you also soon realize that there can be varying levels of success and some challenges that arise with certain processes or products.
We continue to respond and I think that is what Canadians expect.
and in the provinces, people will have to look at that new information and decide whether that will change their approach or their posture.
I think Canadians do not expect that everything we say to be perfect for the months to come.
They expect us to adjust things when the need arises.
Radio-Canada.
a concrete question for you once again -- do we have enough test kits now, particularly with what we just learned about spartan to re-open the Quebec economy and Saskatchewan and other provinces.
Do we have enough? those are decisions that regional and provincial governments will have to make for themselves.
Our responsibility as a federal government is to be there to support the provinces and territories and find solutions to allow them to do more testing and provide the chemicals to equipment they need to ensure that their level of testing is appropriate.
Based on what they believe to be necessary.
So our role is to support the province's decisions and it's up to the provinces to decide whether this new information means they can go more closely or maybe they should slow it down.
But as I say, we are there to help them, to support those decisions.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

It is up to the provinces to determine what is the right step for them, given the tools they have and the profile of the disease that they're facing.
Our job as a federal government is to be there to help provide them with the equipment they need, the support they need as they make the right determination in their region, in their territory, in their province.
We know that there are very different situations across the country and we need to support the provinces in the different approaches and strategies that they take.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

So you're not clearly saying we have enough tests to re-open the economy.
There some people that are worried and those people will wonder if there is a second wave in the coming weeks in British Columbia or elsewhere.
Can the federal government take control and say that is enough, we have to shut things down s. That something you can do? My responsibility to work with the provinces so they tell us we need this level of testing confirm the federal government help us to achieve that level of testing and, yes, our role and responsibility will be to support the provinces to meet those targets.
We respond to the requests that dprom them and their reality on the ground.
Our role is to monitor and coordinate those efforts across the country and ensure that the provinces are able to respond.
If a province stars to re-open and realizes that unfortunately there is an explosion in the number of cases, it will be up to the provinces to respond.
and I know that, in that province, citizens will say at that point that they want a different approach.
But we will be there to support those decisions and make sure that the right ones for Canadians.



Prime Minister Trudeau's one of the things that we need to know is that as provinces move forward, it is possible that we will see a rise in cases in difference areas and the provinces will have to respond with measures either specific to that area or broader measures.
and every step of the way, the federal government will be there to support and be part of the solution as we keep Canadians safe.
But I can certainly tell you that after having spent weeks in isolation, many Canadians will be very, very alert to any signs that we might have to -- we might be entering a second wave and we will be demanding that their leaders respond to keep them safe.
Merci.beaucoup.



**Vassy**:

That is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outside of Rideau cottage, addressing a number of questions from reporters.
I'll start off with the substance of the announcement that he made, sort of multipronged.
First of all, $240 million going towards on-line services for primary health care as well as mental health care.
Then $175 million for a company called a absellera.
My understanding is that is a company that has developeded a platform through which can -- research done around using antibodis from COVID-19 to actually treat the disease.
So, that is a part of the sort of research package that the federal government has funded and put forth so far.
and then the Prime Minister indicated that in about 13 minutes' time, we'll hear from anita annan around the creation of what he calls a national supply council to deal with the re-opening of economies and having enough personal protective equipment, masks or hand sanitizer to be able to successfully do that.
That is where I want to bring in My colleague, david Cochrane.
a lot of questions Prime Minister, david, around re-opening the economy and something we were talking about prior to this, a problem with a new spartan test kit, the pause in that approval process has caused and he got questions what does that mean for testing capacity in provinces? for example, in Quebec, if they can't do enough tests, is it safe for them to re-open?



**Reporter**:

It is important-to-address that with the setback with the spartan test cube, which they believe is a soluble problem, just not right now, no province is seeing their test capacity go down because of this.
They just can't escalate it and expand it at the scale at which they were hoping and escalated and expanding and broaden testing is a key part, the experts tell us, on being able to safely re-open not justs the economy, but re-open society.
and let people get back to some semblance of what is normal.
So, without this being able to go broadly into the canadian testing marketplace, we are left with what we have.
Thater lot of questions there about the various provinces to taking stems to re-open their bubble, like in newfoundland and New Brunswick and the more aggressive re-openings of economic activity in some provinces.
This is going to be a real big experiment for Canada.
We won't find out tomorrow if it works.
We'll find out about 10 days to two weeks from tomorrow when we see if new testing shows a growth in cases and surge in positive tests in the economies that are gradually re-opening and whether that means a scaling back of what we do economyically or whether the test results are good and there can be a further broadening after that.
The Prime Minister was asked point blank, if the provinces screw this up a province screws this up, can the federal government step in and stop it. I don't think that's something that the Prime Minister wants to do. That is akin to the concerns earlier in this crisis about using the emergencies which is something that justin trudeau and the premiers have made clear they don't want to see happen in this country and I can't imagine a fo*uk justin trudeau were to tele gault of -- if Justin Trudeau were to Tell premier legault that he was doing it wrong.
The data in places like Saskatchewan and Quebec where the transmission rate is still higher than one person infecting one person, you want it down to r-naught or r-0. Quebec and Saskatchewan are still above the r-1 level.
That mean they're on track to double over a certain period of days and montreal in particular is the epicenter for this disease in Canada.
So there are significant challenges for provinces that are taking these steps to re-open where there is still high rates of growth in their population.
Less severe in New Brunswick, newfoundland or Prince Edward Island where there are no new active cases right now.
But this is a significant, societal test and political test as provinces move ahead.



**Vassy**:

and Dr. Teresa tam, who we're scheduled to hear from in about 10 minute's time, will be asked about this.
I want to bring in peter Lin, a family physician and CBC medical contributor.
To see you.



Good to sew you, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

These are cube tests that are supposed to work very quickly.
Lots of them on order.
I think a million on order in Ontario.
100, 000 on order in Alberta.
How big of a blow is this to the testing capacity, the future testing capacity of provinces?



Key was it could give you an answer within an hour.
So, places like that are remote they don't have to wait for the swabs to be traveled around and sent and come back three days later.
You can get the answer within an hour.
If you think about it, each machine will process about one per hour.
So, 24 per day.
It is not like the thousands and thousands that we're hearing about that are being processed at the big lab.
Does it help small communities and perhaps certain emergency situations where you need to know the answer within an hour? yes.
But does it help -- does it sort of cripple our system, no. Because we still have huge lab capacity in terms of processing these normal swabs that we're doing.



**Vassy**:

and what about the speed -- the sort of issue around approving these kinds of tests? we'll be in this position when it comes to antibody tests, these are the tests to see if you've had the virus.
That is currently undergoing an approval process as well with health Canada.
What does it tell us about the speed at which these things are being approved and should we expect to be reasonable a few other sort of hiccups along the way?



Yeah.
and I think because of this hiccup, this is a very simple thing.
The test itself works perfectly fine.
The cube can measure and find the virus.
That is not a problem.
The problem comes from the swab.
This test was originally bill to look for DNA.
like do you have the gene for alzheimer's disease? that's what the company was all about.
For that swab, you only need to take a swab on the inside of your mouth and get some cells.
Once you have cells, you can do the whole process on it. Their swab is for your mouth.
Therefore, kit not fit all the way up into your nose and you have to go pretty high up in the nose.
and so because of that, there are swabs that are not able to pick up everything.
You can only swab the inside of your nose or mouth.
Could there be false negatives? in other words, they say you don't have the virus but that is because the swabs didn't get up there.
The device itself is fine.
They just have to come up with another swab.
The moment you do that, you have to show that that swab can collect samples and go through the testing again.
So, we're a little bit society backwards, but definitely fix tonight change the swab.
and the reason why the situation happened is because everybody was in a rush to get the testing part right.
They were getting that right and everybody forgot that we need to get a good sample.
Therefore, fixing the samples what we need to do and then show that it works.



**Vassy**:

Just one more question about re-opening the xhis.
Especially in Quebec where we see in the next week or so, kids start to head back to school.
We're still seeing the numbers there.
You know, in the trim digits for the number of cases.
What is your sense about the readiness of provinces to re-open?



Yeah.
I'm hoping that the government is looking at where the numbers are going up. So let's say the numbers were going up in long-term care.
Let's just say.
Let's say we open up other economy tas are not attached to long-term care or regions.
Montreal proper, there is a lot of spaces there.
Outside of montreal mark ib no cases or low cases.
What I'm hoping is they're opening up things in regions that don't have increasing cases.
Number two is that we have to keep monitoring and number three, we can't give advice like you should be at 50% capacity.
Because that is not what's going to keep us safe.
What is going to keep us safe is we talk about the physical distancing, so that I cannot blow the virus towards you.
Either by talking to you or laughing at you.
Basically we need to keep that.
I think what we should be telling people is keep that distance.
So, individually we can do that.
But we can tell businesses if you are a restaurant, figure out how everybody can fit six feet apart and your servers can be two or three feet apart when they're serving.
I know there already line-ups like the grocery stores where we can have those markings.
Those principles will keep the distances working well.
and it will keep us safe.
You have to make sure to keep that six feet in our mind always present.



**Vassy**:

Ok. Appreciate your insights, as always.



Thank you, Vassy.



Vassy:s the Prime Minister also did, as I mentioned, announced $240 million directed toward on-line services for both primary health care and mental health care.
For that I want to bring in our next guest, dana lee bagley, a registered psychologist in halifax.
Hi, there.
Good to see you.



Hi. Thank you for having me.



**Vassy**:

I want to start with the idea of on-line services for mental health care.
So many people having to stay home.
How significant or important is it that they're able to access those services through their computer?



**Caller**:

I think one of the good things that came about, and I wish I could have come about in a different way, but one of the things that came about is an increased focus on mental health and delivered without protecting our mental health.
So, the physical distancing is absolutely necessary as we just hear.
and it's also really hard on mental health, right? these are not the things that we recommend for good mental health.
I think it is especially important to be able to access professional services.
So these are unprecedented times and that might also mean that we do things we wouldn't normally do in itemingers of accessing professional mental health.
Mental health's translates very well on-line.
You can do therapy quite well.
There's studies showing the effectiveness of that and we also need to make sure that the rural communities have access to the internet because those are exactly the communitis that we want to increase accessibility and often I don't have stable internet to make use of these resources.



**Vassy**:

That is a really good point of discussion among parliamentarians and specifically the opposition parties, too.
You run your own practice.
What have you seen up close about the effects of this pandemic on Canadians' mental health?



So, really it is the only thing we talk about in all of the sessions how to protect our mental health.
How to stay stable.
We are talking about trying to charge our batteries and do things that are deliberate about protecting our mental health.
It is taking a toll.
We've seen Stu's showing that it is taking a toll and also that people are willing to continue doing it if that means keeping people safe.
So having additional services that you can access and professional services that you can access to help us cope with that is really important.



**Vassy**:

Just a minute left.
But My sense prior to this was that access to those services was already strained and already an issue far lot of Canadians.
This is more money, but how big of an issue is that access?



So, I've seen people talk about.
The first wave is COVID-19 deaths, the second wave is acute deaths like heart disease or heart attacks.
The third is chronic disease management so people that didn't get services.
Fourth is mental health and it is the longest one.
The one we have to deal with long past when the outbreak is done because there will be long-term consequences.
Both for as the public as well as essential service workers and frontline providers.
We need to be mindful of this for a very long time to come.



**Vassy**:

We sure will be. Thank you for sharing your expertise.
Dana lee bagley, a registered psychologist in Halifax.
We're standing by in a minute's time to take you back to parliament hill for a press conference from the two ministers in charge of procurement and Dr. Teresa tam, the chief public health officer.
She surely will be asked about some of the questions around a pause in testing capacity or perhaps limits on testing capacity for provinces and what that means for their ability to open things up. Minister annand will talk about a national supply council.
We know there are issues with the personal protective equipment, hand sanitizers, masks, that kind of thing.
There have been issues.
This council is developed to address all of that going forward and ramp up that supply as provincial economies open up. That is it for us here on CBC naous.
WI will continue on CBC news network.
Stay with us and join us there.
I'm Vassy kapelos.



Let me start off on the procurement issue because it'sbeen with us for the last six weeks and I don't think I've saw it as much about personal protective equipment or known as much about the supply of it. They have ramp ed up the capacity to meet that supply.
The idea of what if this happens again or what kind of personal protective equipment is necessary to reopen our economy, even for the private sector, is one the feds are facing.



**Reporter**:

There's a lot of conversations and questions are going to come out of this.
We'll see what the details are of the supply council but longerterm, this has laid very out before the country to see just how deficient is on personalequipment.
It has changed with Canada goose and stanfield ramping up to makegowns, face shields and medicine building a mask manufacturing line here in Canada.
We rely on foreign countries to deliver this stuff.
When the world is competing for the same stuff at the same time to deal with the same problem, you have issues on cut-throatcompetition and issues aroundinferior quality.
Some of the things Canada hasbeen able to secure have beenfound to be not of sufficientenough quality to be used in anacute care medical setting.
We're going to get an update anda path forward, it seems, on thesteps towards that domesticself-sufficiency.
The Minister of buying andbuilding in terms of how this isgoing and they're going to giveus a sense of what is going tohappen there.
It has shown how vulnerable thehealth system and how we rely onchina, which is under themicroscope of anger andfrustration in a geopoliticalsense because of what it may ormay not have done in the earlystages.



**Vassy**:

That's what I want to ask you about.
We did see a number of questions directed to the prime minister today about a couple of reports coming out of the United States.
The first, comes from secretary of state mike Pompey who did an interview on ABC which he said, I can tell you there'ssignificant amount of evidence this came from that lab inwuhan.
Where this pandemic first started in china.
He did not, of course, at this point say what the evidence was.
He add the best experts, so far, seem to think it was man-made.
That jumps off another reportthat talks about china, forexample, limiting exports assoon as they recognize it was acontagion in late december andearly January.
To your point, we're so reliantat this point, as far as thesupply chain goes, as being ableto get that personal protectiveequipment that those medicalsupplies from china.
So these questions become evenmore important for the federalgovernment and the Prime Minister was asked, well, haveyou seen that evidence? he did not directly answer that.



**Reporter**:

He said -- he is not drawing any firm conclusion son anything about the origins of the virus.
The fox news report, there was are port in the daily telegraph citing an intelligence report pointing to this.
Without independent confirmation from the Canadian government, without a statement from thecanadian government, I'm not sure what to say about that.
a week ago, United States intelligence reports were telling us kimjong-un was dead and they say heis fine.
Now he is attending events.
Intelligence is not alwaysright.
We've seen the United States secretary ofstate go to the united nationsand say there were weapons ofmass destruction in iraq andlook what happened there.
China will have to answerquestions about what it did anddidn't do in the early stages ofthis.
Certainly, whether it came from a lab or a market, which seemsto be the dominant theory tothis point, is something thatthe Prime Minister says willneed to be sorted out andinvestigated through the initialhealth crisis in the country andaround the world.
I don't think there's anyquestions on any world leader'smind that china was not at allcandid about the early stages ofthis and took steps to lookafter its interest in a way tocompromise everybody else.
To ensure they had the medicalsupplies and capacity theyneeded to deal with the viruswhen it got to their country.
The challenge in all of this, you still need the suppliesbecause no one is through thisyet and a lot of those suppliesare made in china.
While the United States may havethe geopolitical hef to gotoe-to-toe middle power likecanada just can't in terms ofrisking the anger of chineseregime and losing access to themasks and the gownses and thegloves and sanitizer it has madeover there.



**Vassy**:

That's interesting to watch the Prime Minister and many who get these questions as they try to navigate, I guess, the response to that.
I remember talking to health minutes pattyhajdu who wouldn't say, forexample, that an investigation -- there should bean investigation at the end of this all this.
We hear the Prime Minister say those are questions that can be asked but we'll do that later.
As the United States and -- you areright, there's a disparity in our roles in the world, but as the United States continues to talk about this and continues to be more specific about the intelligence or if there is evidence the evidence that they see, imagine those questions will persist for the federal government and it's going to get harder to keep saying, let'sjust wait until the this is allover.



**Reporter**:

We have to consider the American context that it is in the best interest of the trump administration in an election year to be talking about blame for the cause rather than blame for the response of the Americans.
There's a lot of criticism for the United States response and what happened in terms of their preparedness and what is happening and you can see in the protest in their state legislature and people going to the homes of state government officials demanding reopening.
There's a political desire to talk about other things in the United states right now.
and china is one of those things that they want to talk about.
It doesn't takeaway the fact there needs to be an investigation to find out these answer they can learn lesson for the next time some sort of novel virus appears and threatens theworld's health.
Politics and the pandemic are mixing in a very significant way right now and we've always Giotto keep that in mind.



**Vassy**:

Let me swing back, David, as we wait for the minister and chief public-healthofficer, Dr. Theresa tam --never mind.
They're on the way.
I think a lot of us are thinkingand talking about that.
I believe they're stepping up. We're going to listen todr.
Teresa tam.



Good afternoon, everyone.
We're starting by hearing fromdr.
Tam and we'll hear from the minister bairn by videoconference.



Good afternoon, everyone.
Bonjour.
I'll start with the latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada.
There are now 57, 148 confirmedcases, including 3, 606 deaths.
To date, labs across Canada have tested over 893, 000 people forcovid-19 with about 6.5% of these testings positive.
There's the part where we usually move on to a brief update on how we are continuing to slow down the epidemic and what is needed next for us to get down the curve cautiouslytogether.
Instead, I want to pause here to reflect on the significance behind our daily numbers.
Numbers that are impossible to fully encapsulate.
Each one of the 57, 000 cases has been an illness striking fear and concern for each person, family, friends and community.
Each death has been a tragedy and to this, each death ha soften meant a good-bye to lovedones.
Not giving hugs and comfortingtouches.
It's in these tragic conditionsthat we are most thankful foreveryone on the front line ofthis crisis.
Not only do we count on healthworkers on the frontlines tocomfort us when we are sick andscared, but they are there tooffer comforting words, andhealing touches.
They reach out when we have toremain during illness, hospitalstays and last moments.
They keep us informed as ourloved ones are being cared forand they share the sadness ofnews when illness outcomes canbring only tears.
There is comfort in knowing howhealth workers, from those whosupport and maintain ourhospitals and care homes, tothose who deliver direct patientcare, have stepped in andstepped up to allow humanity toshine.
From the cleaners who share aword of comfort as they go abouttheir duties and those who bringby meals, to a range of and givereassurance.
We can know our loved ones arebeing provided care with humantouch and concern.
As you suffer the loss of aloved one, they wait for you exwith you.
and all Canadians are forsympathy as suffer the greatestloss of all during this crisis.
Today, I offer these reflectionlcanadians whether they arehelping in a hospitals andlong-term care homes, providingessential services orvolunteering in our communitiesor continuing to do the verybest to stay home to save lives.
Every life matters.
Keep it up, Canada, we arestronger together.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam.



Bonjour.




This is Dr. Howard Njoo of this country following remarks from Dr. Teresa tam of Canada.
Her remarks focused on providing some context to the numberswe've heard so far.
We have some issues, technical issues with our translator so as soon as Dr. Njoo we will bring back that audio.
We'll have the translation for you as well.
Dr. Tam, pointing out that as oftoday, 893, 000 tests have been conducted in this country with6.5% of them confirmed positive.
That number has picked up over the past few weeks, the number of positive tests but that'santicipated as testing capacityincreases.
She also spoke about the impact for the first time.
She says she paused to talk about the impact behind the numbers and more specifically, at the number of people who have contracted this virus as well as passed away from it and the number of people then, who have to mourn the loss of their loved ones without being able, forexample, to hold the funeral.
We've seen so many examples of that over the past six weeks.
and the translation is back sowe'll take a listen.



Or those who deliver direct patient care.
Cleaners who share comfort as they go about their duties or those who bring by the day'smeals to a whole range of healthcare providers who hold atrial end hand and givereassurance.
We can know our loved ones are being provided care with human touch and concern in our way.
The loss of a loved one, they wait for you and with you and all Canadians offer sympathy as you suffer the greatest loss of all during this crisis.
Today, as we offer thisreflections, I'm thanking allcanadians whether they are helping in a hospitals andlong-term care homes, providingessential services orvolunteering in our community orcontinuing to do their very bestto stay home to save lives.
Because every life matters, sotoo does our every event toprevent the spread of COVID-19. Keep it up, Canada, we arestronger together.
Thank you.



Now, we'll listen to ministeranan.



Thank you so much, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo.
I echo your appreciation for our front line healthcare workers.
I too will begin by sending myheart-felt condolences to peoplewho have lost loved ones as wellas to the family and friendswith the loss of the six membersof the canadian armed forces wholost their lives serving ourcountry.
As a fellow Nova Scotia an, letme say that we are all grievingwith you.



As in the rest of the world, most of our supplies continue coming from abroad.
We are still facing logistical challenges because of the heightened global demand, but significant progress is beingmade.



They have helped us bring home supplies with flights coming in nearly everyday this past week.
We have also engage ups to provide additional assistance with moving Poe out of shanghai.
In a competitive environment, our dedicated team, on the ground in china, insures that supplies are coming into the warehouse and making their way onto the plane back to Canada.



Our objective is to put safe, reliable and effective equipment in the hands of our healthprofessionals.
and we are taking all necessary measures for this to happen.
We are remaining extremely vigilant when it comes to the quality of the products we aredistributing.



We are only dealing with companies that can meet the standards that we require.
Nationally, Canadian companies are continuing to increase production and deliveries areunderway.



Based in Toronto, delivered their first shipment of ventilators to the federalgovernment.
Our first shipments of face shields began to come in this week with more than 740, 000received to date.
Half of which were produced herein Canada by companies likebauer and Toronto stamps.
I'm happy to report we have signed new contracts for15.5 million face shields from sterling industries, affiliated with Honda and from Canada.
As I mentioned last week, we managed to secure a shapementfrom china of vital chemical components required to produce the agent.
This week I'm happy to announce we have finalized a new agreement with lumen ultra, adeading company in new Brunswick's the corporation now has the components it needs to produce enough free-agent for 500, 000more tests per week.
Domestic production right hereat home.
I AM also delighted to announcethat we are now finding along-term agreement with mediconin Quebec.
For the manufacture here incanada of 20 million n95 receip5respirator and masks for thenext 10 years.
Starting this summer.
This long-term procurement isfor essential products and forother things is part of our planto ensure that Canada isprepared now and in the futurein collaboration with ministerbaines.
We have signed a new contractwith logistics uni core, amanufacturing company in st. John's in Quebec.
They are providing 11 millionmedical gowns.
Logistic uni corp is one of the30, 000 corporations whichresponded to the all for actionthat was published on the buyand sell site where we areasking suppliers to help usfight COVID-19.



How companies like canadahave stepped up to meet the current challenges that we are facing together.
Their ingenuity and tenacity will help us through thiscrisis.
Last week, we launched a running report of our procurement only our website.
Which was updated on Friday.
The figures are showing that we have made progress in ordering and obtaining supplies from the country and abroad.
But we will not slow down ourefforts.
In addition to our -- we will not give up. We are not letting up.



We are preparing for a new wave of infection or a sudden resurgence at any given time, which would renew the immediate need for further orders of critical supplies.
That is why I have formed acovid-19 supply council by brings together a diverse group of leaders from the canadianchamber of commerce to the red cross to provide advice on building innovative and agile supply chains from start tofinish.
This council is about bringing together diverse industries and experiences in order to best serve Canadians through the next phases of this crisis.
The council compliments My work with procurement ministers from provinces and territories right across the country.
As an example of ourcollaboration, when we spoke onfriday, My counterpart innunavut, raised an urgent --with the department of nationaldefence, we were able to ens urea shipment of swabs was sent on its way to Nunavut within 24hours.
Cooperation has proven to beinvaluable, time and time again, throughout this crisis.
Together, we remain vigilant in our efforts to secure the vital supplies that will keepcanadians safe today, tomorrow, and in the months ahead.
Thank you so much.



Thank you, Minister, we'regoing to hear from the minister of innovation science andindustry.



Thank you, very much, anitaand thank you very much, Carl.
Six weeks ago, we called oncanada's investment community to help me with the critical need for personal health equipment and health supplies.
We also reached out to the wealth of Canadian researchinstitutions, universities, and sciences to mobilize science in the fight against COVID-19. Since then, two things have stood out for me. First, the fear which canadiancompanies and researchers all across the country have stepped up and offered their help to do whatever they can to assist the fellow Canadians in the crisis.
Secondly, the diverse ways thatcanadian innovation has been deployed to address the challenges we're facing.
Neither are surprising to me andi'm proud of the work being done by our world-class industrial inthe community.



More than 6, 000 canadiancooperations have offered up their expertise and capacities.
We have also mobilized a great number of researchers and scientists who are researching solutions to this unprecedentedchallenge.



The most recent progress coming from these efforts.
First, I'm pleased to announce the contribution of more than$175 million to the buy logics, a bio tech company in Vancouver, they were the first in northamerica to receive a sample.
and just a few short weeks, they have screened 6 million cell sand have identified over 500human antibodies.
They're working on identifying which of those 500 antibodies cannot only block the COVID-19but can be made into a drug totreat the virus.
It's currently working withpartners to select antibodiesthat are highly potent, broadlyneutralizing and capable oflarge-scale manufacturing.
Antibodies found during theresearch may also be used tocreate tests for COVID-19 andthe company is working withseveral local organizations tosupport the development of newdiagnostics and monitoring thedisease.
Human critical trials areexpected to begin in the summer.
Over the long run, they willhave antibodies so our countryis prepared to respond to futurepandemics.
Let me turn now to updates ontest kits and face shields.
We know that we will need alarge number of reliable andaccessible tests if we are toreopen the economy safely andresponsibly.
That is why we just signedletters of intent.
Diagnostic bio Canada.
These companies were selected toaccelerate a process that sawover 100 submissions.
Similar to what we did withventilators, and the nationalresearch council of Canada andthe panel of external expertsidentified the most promisingshort-term canadianmanufacturing options fortesting.
The supercluster is alsosupporting other aspects oft.
P.e. Manufacturing.
Eight projects have already beenapproved.



It has contracted three new projects focused by medical faceshields.
These projects are bringing together manufacturing in 3-dprinting companies and it will result in hundreds of thousands of face shields being produced daily by June first.



To conclude, I would like to state that this super cluster ismodellizing its members and has approved eight new projects to fight against COVID-19.



Innovation is central of our mobilization efforts and working with the research experts, we continue in our mission of supporting our healthcare workers and ensuring the safety of Canadians as we navigate thispandemic.
Together, we will win thisfight.
Thank you very much.



Thank you, Minister Bains.
We'll start with threequestions.
One question, one follow-up andwe'll go to the room.



Thank you.
Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
I'm sorry I think maybe you havesome technical issues.
I can hardly hear clearly theministers so I'm hoping that dryquestion.
What happened exactly with thisspartan cube test, how come itwas three weeks ago, good to goand now it's not?



So, I think it wasapril 11th when health canadaauthorized spartan, the test kit in the interim order of path way this is part of acceleration of access to our innovativetesting.
Built into that process is actually clinical validation of the device and its systems.
It was the national microbiology lab from the public-healthagency who collaborated withclinical sites in threeprovinces to actually use thisdevice and system to takesamples from actual patients.
While the spartan system or thedevice performed very well in alab setting and along thespecifications that themanufacturer had provided, itwas in the real life setting inthe clinical setting where itdidn't perform well.
Right now, it appears it may berelated to the pro priority swabthat goes with the system.
So, I think what health canadais doing is to amend theauthorized intended use forresearch use only so that moreclinical validations can be donewhen the manufacturer adjustsits system.
I actually think this is areally -- it really highlightsthe importance of the kind ofquality assurance we're put togo our new tests and that reallyhas been no use of this test kitin a way that would haveimpacted patient dying know tickbecause do you this in thecontext of a actual clinicaltrial evaluation.



Ok. and I understand when you talk about the swab, we're talking about the thing that actually gets the sample, I guess and if not please correct me. We were test Ing 23, 000 a day and you were hoping for almost three times as much, 60, 000.
How does this spartan tube setback impact this objective?



It actually doesn't impact it because the provincial territorial targets, collectively, of the 60, 000 is just on the existing tests within the public-health labsand then we would add on top ofthat any point of care testingthat comes on board.
Some of which are already inuse, that's just the geneexperts, that is, for example, also being used in Nunavut, forexample.
So some of the points of care is in addition to that initialprovincial territorial capacitytarget of 60, 000 and I do knowthat people, the provinces areramping up the testing and we'llsee what happens in the nextseven days as they ramp up somemore.
I know that in the last 24hours, we actually did over31, 000 tests, thank you.
The next question is from leefrom the canadian press.
Please go ahead.



Yes, thank you.
This question is for Dr. Tam.
a number of provinces will take the next steps tomorrow towardsreopening.
What will you and otherpublic-health officials watchfor, especially in Quebec where1, 000 cases were reportedyesterday.
Does the spartan recall or theissues have that have beenhighlighted there, have anyimpact what you are seeing interms of -- or what we mightexpect in terms of long-term orreopening up?



Well, I think both of these provinces have plans in place to escalate the testing and the target of 60, 000 doesn't include any additional of those new tests like point of care.
So, this is because we'relooking at so many different streams of new tests coming onboard, they'll have to re adjust the time lines of perhaps when they would have expected the spartan system to be on board but this is the most prude course of action because you don't want a actual system out there that isn't picking up the cases as it should.
I think that is actually are ally good validation approach.
In terms of, of course, as you heard from chief medical officers of both of those provinces and across thecountry, there's no exact right pathway down this slope and into the new realities of living withcovid-19. We all know that it has to be cautious and we have to actually look at what happens.
Some of the criteria is pub accomplished looking at cases coming down so if you see cases coming back up again, you have to re-evaluate what is going on. Of course, one of the criticalaspects is your healthcarecapacity and your icu capacityso making sure they're trackingall of those parameters as theygo about these baby steps andcautious path towards this newrea lot of living with COVID-19. Everyone will be watching verycarefully has to what happens to the activities and I know thatprovinces are trying to separateout the actual clusters withincertain settings like long-termcare from what might be actuallycommunity transmission sothey'll try to look at theepidemiology from thatperspective as well.



Follow-up.



The number of new cases that were reported in Quebec yet, do you think it's appropriate for this province to move ahead on its plans to reopen?



It's up to the province ofquebec to look at that situation and Quebec is a big province and it may not be the same even within the actual province itself so I'm certain that the doctor and the quebecpublic-health system willmonitor this in all differentaspects of the province and theymay not do things at the sametime for different areas ofquebec as well.
The details are within thepurview of the province.



Thank you, next question, please.



Thank you.



My question --



**Caller**:





Do we have enough test because you talk about a 60, 000target and we are reaching30, 000.
Some provinces will be reopening soon and that is before we are able to carry out enoughscreenings.



This is Dr. Njoo here.
Thank you for your question.
It's always a concern for all provinces and territories to have the capacity to screen people within theiradministration.
The capacity has increasedsignificantly.
The provinces and territories are also increasing capacities.
As we've said before.
There's good capacity throughout country to take care of diagnostic screening based on the tests.
Now, we are also introducing other tools like testing at service points something is happening now with spartan andit's something we need to manage and resolve but ultimately we have the capacity.
It's up to the provinces to make adjustments when necessary.
and they may also need to loosen up their public servicemeasures.
Should I repeat in English, is that Ok.



We're saying, yes, at the present time the province andterritories, their capacity for lab testing, which is key, willcontinue.
They've taken steps to increase their lab capacity and that continues to this day andcertainly, within each province and territory, they're making sure that as they may be start to begin to reaction certainpublic-health measures thatcapacity to rapidly detect casesis there.
Right now the capacity is basedon the molecular test and itwill be the gold standard fornow but certainly, province andterritories as well as federalgovernment we're looking atother types of technology tobring more tools available fortesting individuals and we'vejust talked about what we callpoint of care testing and wehope in the coming days andweeks make the adjustments inthe clinical sense.



Thank you, doctor.



Follow-up question -- theclarification.
There's something I do notunderstand do we have enough fortesting, we're not just doingenough testing or we don't haveenough.
We're doing 30, 000 and thetarget is 60, 000 and maybeanother one understand tagenough testing is being done toopen the economy where as theeconomy is going to be openingsomewhere.
I will answer and it's difficultbecause we can't really give youspecific figures it all dependson the demand.
If people fall sick, we need tofind out if we have diagnostictesting.
It's not just a matter oftesting everyone.
We already know that it's veryimportant to test someone at theright time.
If we screen someone who is notill, there is a danger of havinga false negative so it alldepends on demand.
What is happening now within thepopulation with the spread ofthe virus.
Well, we have the capacity inthe country but not allprovinces and territories andit's something we need tofollow-up closely because if westart relaxing somepublic-health measures, we needa system and it's creatingsystem to properly, rapidlydetect the virus if there is asurge in cases, that is reallythe issue.
The issue is not the exactfigures or the available test.



Thank you, Dr. To be. I'll turn to the room.
Starting with Mary Walsh from"the globe and mail."



We're having trouble hearing you so I hope this will work.
I'm just wondering if you can tell me exactly what gap is currently in the supply ofP.P.E. That you are hoping thiscouncil will fill? what specifically is missingfrom the compliment this willnow help do?



Thank you, I hope you can hear me now.
is it any better? the supply council is not meant to fill a particular gap in the supply chain per SE but the goal in establishing the supply council is to provide another lens into the point-to-pointprocurements we're doing fromstart to finish, frommanufacturer to a arrival orproduction in Canada, what is itthat we can be doing differentlyto ensure that we have properand effective and efficientprocurements within ourgovernment and across thecountry.
So the idea is that it is addingto our existing processes bydrawing on the expertise ofmultiple individuals from adiverse set of sectors so thatwe can ensure that we arethinking about all the necessarythings that we need to bethinking about in procurement.
So for example, in terms ofdistribution, we have much tolearn in terms of diversecommunities.
Should we be adoptingalternative and additionalprocesses to ensure that we canreach vulnerable populations andpart of our conversation withthe supply council will revolvearound Canada's incrediblediversity and how we can dobetter in terms of ourprocurement to ensure thateveryone has the supplies thatare necessary across thiscountry.



What is your -- what are thegovernment's forecast of how much P.P.E. We will need eitherper number in population or perweek or a mix of those when wereopen? how much more P.P.E. Will we need when we're all trying to get back to work?



It's definitely true that, across the country, where youare, people are talking about personal protective equipment and the incredible needs that we are for seeing.
Let me be clear, our firstpriority, as the federal government at the opportunity Ce's to procure P.P.E. For ourfront line healthcare workers.
That's what we're doingeverything single day and we'reprocuring from internationalsources and as Minister bainsand I have been working on hard, domestic retooling is part ofthat equation.
Diversifying supply chains.
In terms of what is going to beneeded for ppe, this is anongoing conversation that I havebeen having with My provincialand territorial counterparts andthat we are going to becontinuing to have as we gothrough the next phases of thepandemic.
I will say that from aprocurement perspective, we areplanning for a short andlong-term.
We are planning for this phase as well as potential additional searches in the pandemic so that we can be prepared for alleventualities.
This is procurement like it'snever been done before for that very reason.
We need to be planning for the short and the long-term and alleventualities.



Thank you, Minister.



**Caller**:

Can you tell me the impact of the spartan setbackis? is it province and territories that ordered these test kits.
You said they talked about ramping up quickly? what impact does this have?



This is in addition to the targeted around 60, 000 so westill, even within that scope got another halfway to go. If you think about we're doing30, 000 a day since yesterday, there's still ROM for them to continue to ramp up the testingapproaches.
So, then the point of careactually, the KIA justment and plans will be for the rural and remote communities.
The concept of using these mere patient tests so we can render these communities more independent of transportation.
So any kind of delays might in fact impact on the fact that we need to continue to transportspecimens, for example, that would have been dealt withearlier.
We are looking at other supplies of the point of care so thisisn't the on one.
I think it's, again, a dynamicprocess.
There are suppliers that are ab it more established, if youlike, but when we look at innovation space we know the pathway of innovation will have some bumps and I think this is one of those bumps.
It only forms one part of the strategy so I think we will continue to look for other solutions to fill in those gaps.
From My perspective the impact is more on the timeliness for the remote testing time.



**Caller**:

How many province sand territories ordered these spartan kits and how many are we talking about are held back because of the setback? thousands and millions?







We might have to get back to the numbers because I don't havethem.
I just know that it was three provinces that helped with the clinical trials which we were involved in and I think that there were 5, 500 test kits assort of part of thatdistribution.
Beyond that, I don't know that it was any distribution and idon't know how much it would have been.



**Caller**:

It's important not to refer to what is happening with this spartan test kit as arecall.
This is part of the process of spartan being ramp ed up. We're not expecting them to be ready in this moment in anycase.
In My view, the issues that you are highlighting aren't arecall, aren't detective product at all.
The public-health lab said theywill be used in researchsettings and spartan willcontinue to produce and reviewand revise the technology thatit is producing for the rapidtest kits and then, as thetesting warrants, they will be able to be used across thecountry.
Again, this is part of theprocess of producing newtechnology, of producingsomething that is going to bevery important but is justgetting retooled and ramped upat the current time.



**Caller**:

My first question goes to Dr. Tam, the Prime Minister today when asked about the economy's reopening and talked about how there is different realities and eachprovince, but we do know that the virus doesn't know anyborders, and we've been told many times.
That would apply here in Canada's well.
So, as the various province reopens at different times, are you going to recommend that enter provincial travel remain completely or become completely shutdown to make sure that different pockets don't pop up in different areas?







We have to share information in each jurisdiction and the enter provincial is done among each one.
Every province will be watching all the other provinces in terms of where their stance is. For provinces that have very minimal healthcare capacity they will be careful and they'restill going to be of course looking at the 14-day isolation periods for anyone coming inside of the territory and I think some of that will continue as we see what happens as people gingerly go through the nextstage.
So absolutely.
I think people will be watching but the issue of whatpublic-health systems might dowithin the provinces, within thejurisdiction, of course, from afederal and just maintainingservices through interprovincialtransport in order to maintainthe essential supplies thatstill have to occur.
So that will continue again.



I will add to that if it'sthe provincial authorities and territorial authorities have the best of a pulse of what is actually happening in their ownjurisdictions.
The issue of travel is not between provinces but even within provinces as we know even in the province of Quebec, thehotspot is Montreal and other parts of the situation isdifferent.
At one point, they had restrictions in terms of travel within the province.
The principle they're always looking at including the federallevel, is maintaining physical distancing and whatever measure scan be brought to bear to reinforce that, that's whatthey'll continue to do.



We talk about businesses reopening and knowing there's an adequate amount of P.P.E. Andmasks, and other equipment tomake sure stop the spread, aspart of today's announcement, will equipment be goingdirectionally to businesses orhealthcare workers, where weknow there are issues in thosetypes of institutions? will there be an allocation arbreakdown of who is getting thisP.P.E.?



I think the health-caresystem remains a priority sothere's an existing and theprovince and territories to lookat with needs and allocation andit will be dynamic and thecritical aspect of the nextstage is to ask the non urgenthealth services to come back andlook at those requirements.
Also that, is done through theprovincial system and also, making sure they are long-termcare and publicly funded butthat system needs to be able toactually provide the necessaryP.P.E. Those coordination discussionsare definitely happening at theministerial level to make surethe health systems can re adjustgoing forward and I think interms of essential services, youknow, there's on goingdiscussions but the key is thatany business trying to open mustalign with public-healthinstruction and you have to lookat the plan for how they reopenand half of them looked at by the actual public-healthauthorities and that is the mostimportant thing because if youhave the specks of the twometres or barriers orengineering criteria thebusinesses know how that worksthe most in order for them tolook forward to plan to reopenso there's a lot of work and iknow in that space and a lot ofguidance for the differentsectors within the jurisdictionsas well.
That's really quite active rightnow and we Right get a littlebit more of an idea under whichcircumstances are people are notable to maintain the two-metredistance and that will give us abetter idea of what that supplyrequirement might look like.



Thank you, I think we have one more question.



Thank you, the next question is from Savannah odd from newbrunswick news.
Go ahead.



**Caller**:

My question is for minister bain.
We seen an investment in primary care and what is being done to improve reliable internet access for rural Canadians so that they current left out of thisinvestment?



Thank you, very much for thatquestion.
I'm glad you raised this issue.
High-speed internet connectivityis no longer a luxury, it'sessential.
Our government recognizes thatwe would deal device and we needinvestments to the which help900 communities receive highspeed connectivity and weunveiled, in our last budget, auniversal broadband initiativeworth $1.7 billion and mycolleague is responsible forconnectivity in that programmeand she'll be working veryaggressively to move that agendaforward because we realise thatthe four and and this is apriority for our government.



Follow-up.



Yes, so, for Minister, as we see provinces move faster towards recovery or in later stages where they're starting toreopen, I guess before someothers, will P.P.E. Distributionbe effected by that so if aprovince is, I guess, furtheralong into a recovery phase, does that factor into how P.P.E. is distributed.
I know it currently isper-capita with some wiggle roombased on emergency.
Could you just elaborate onwhether it's part of it.



Can you go back to say that the government is based on are quest that has come from the provinces and territories for purchases that they require forefront line healthcareworkers.
and so as I said, that is the priority at current time.
In terms of P.P.E. That would begenerally available it's ongoing discussion and I've hadprocess tive discussions witharound the procurement tablethat I have struck with thevarious ministers from thoseprovinces.
I will say that there is muchwork to be done on essentialservices and P.P.E. Foressential services and and thefederal is not the onlypurchaser of P.P.E. In thecountry.
Hospitals are procuring P.P.E., and healthcare centersthemselves are procuring P.P.E. So this is an ongoingconversation.
It's important to remember thatthere are a number of and theglobal environment is incrediblystrained.
The demand is high and andtaking an approach to todetermine the best way forwardon these important questions.

Those are federal ministers navdeep Bains andDr.
Howard Njoo and talking about testing capacity in thiscountry, specifically Dr. Tam says while we set at 23, 000tests a day right now, they'rehoping to bring it up to 60, 000.
I want to bring in davidcochrane, we have a minute and half to debrief on what wassaid.
Let me get you on spartantesting, because that's whatwe've been talking about allday.
They did specifically address what impact the impediment has going forward.



The spartan test cube say game changer when it was first announced last month because it could give you a result within an hour and you could do it port at bleed.
The kit tests properly but the problems is the swabs don'tcollect the samples to the standard that they want for this to be reliable part of Canada'stesting regime.
It's been sent back for some tweaks and working at spartan bio science and go through the approval process again.
There's confidence this is solvable problem and this will come backout.
The down side of this is that it limits their ability to brodentesting in rural and remote places or do instant tests.
The lab capacity of the countryuneffected by this.
This is not a drop in testingcapacity.
It's just a slow down in the ability to accelerate and expandit.



**Vassy**:

We're done.
