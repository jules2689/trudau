# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

Ok. That is the Prime Minister of Canada, on this Thursday.
Making a lot of detailed announcements around the student aid package that was announced back in April.
a total of $9 billion.
But this announcement today giving more specifics on how the volunteer grant programme would work and announcement that the government is creating thousands of jobs and placements for university and cegep and high school students in the months ahead.
So, there will be some employment opportunities for young people coming very soon.
I'll bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics" Vassy kapelos and the cbc's Catherine Cullen.
Obviously, we'll want to talk about china.
I'll do a student part first because I know lots of people are looking for that information as well.
The volunteer programme, which will give you access to $1, 000 to $5, 000 starts today and ends at the end of October.
Vassy?



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and I think that the Prime Minister said you can qualify for work done between June 15 -- or June 18 and September 15. Yes.
June 18 and September 15. I looked at the website that he called up to get some more detail on exactly how much you can qualify for, like what kind of things you have to do to qualify for.
It sound like it is $1, 000 per 100 hours volunteer.
If you are in between markers of 100, so say you eve done 150 hours, you would not qualify until you reach 200 for 2, 000 and so forth.
So, it look like those parameters are pretty clear.
There are some questions.
I know the website says, for example, that you qualify as of June 25 and the Prime Minister said June 18. So s trying to get some clarification.



**Rosemary**:

I'm told that was a typo, the June 18. So it does start today.
[laughter]and ends the end of October.



**Vassy**:

My guess is, and I'm seeing response to the tweet he put out, there is an example of volunteer hours prior to that.
Because for many university students they would have been off as of the beginning of may, perhaps a bit earlier.
Won't qualify towards that amount of money.
But that is the parameter that the government set out today.
So, I imagine that the website is iwanttohelp.
Org.
That does have a lot more details and I'm sure we'll be continuing to get reaction to some of the parameters around eligibility.
I should also mention if you are on the student benefit -- so if you are getting that $1250 a month, you can still qualify for this in addition to that.
However, if you're accessing CERB, we were talking about earlier how about how one fifth of people who applied are within that 15 to 24 age range.
If you are accessing CERB, it doesn't look like you will be able to access it. You have to be on the student CERB in order to get the volunteer benefit as well.
If you are on the regular CERB, you won't be able to. Those are the details.



**Rosemary**:

If you don't have a job, there is 10, 000 new job placements between 15 and 30. There's 20, 000 student workplacements, a new programme where you could do internships at an organization called My tax.
So, you'll want to go on the website if you are a student and looking for places to make money or do work.
Because lots more has suddenly become available s. Ok. I'll shift to china now.
I'll get you both in-to-weigh in on that, obviously.
The Prime Minister facing many similar questions about his response to that letter from well-known canadian and the pressure by them and I would say others as well that perhaps the solution to getting the two michaels -- michael kovrig and Michael spavor -- released is also to release meng wanzhou and the Prime Minister, as we expected, his tune didn't change but his language was quite tough.
Vassy?



**Vassy**:

and it was very specific to the content and the names on the letter because he was asked, as you mentioned a number of times, these are 19 prominent political figures in this country.
He says he deeply disagrees with them.
He respects them but deeply disagrees with them.
I respect these individuals, but they're wrong in their approach.
He was emphatic over and over again.
Should we do what the letter in part suggests, which is end extradition -- end the extradition of Meg wanzhou, the extradition proceedings.
That would essentially be handing leverage to china over the federal government and telling them if they are -- and I'm using his words -- arbitrarily take two Canadians that they'll get what they want from the Canadian government and he went on to say that that would further endanger any Canadian who traveled anywhere in the world.
So, that was the thesis that he put forward over and over again.
I thought that -- I think you're right that if it's what we expected to hear from him, but I do think that the language has sharpened.
Most certainly in the past few weeks and that is interesting for a couple of reasons.
First of all, the Prime Minister -- the primary criticism of the Prime Minister so far on the file of china was that he was not tough enough ton country.
Right? and that primarily comes from the right.
It has definitely come from various candidates for the conservative party leadership as well as current leader of the party, Andrew Scheer.
This language was, you know, again it's the same gist of things that he said before.
But it was more punctuated.
I think that is fair to say.
I also thought that our colleague, Olivia stefanovich had an interesting question.
While the Prime Minister was emphatic and specific, I think there is an area of questioning around -- you heard him say they are working hard bethienld scene, right? that they are working on a solution.
But what we've heard from the family this week, and even those 19 individuals who signed the letter to be fair to them was there is, you know, what else is it? right? what else are you doing behind the scenes? I know they don't want to disclose too much and endanger further the likes of Michael kovrig and Michael spavor.
But various people have suggested, Kings , for example, certain Chinese individual and revoke visas of others.
There are other tools that you could use that could, in fact, back up the kind of language that the Prime Minister used today.
But so far-and today he seemed reticent as well.
He said we're considering a lot of things.
But the government hasn't been specific.
Other than they're working hard behind the scene, we really don't have any specifics.
They're not willing to consider this option put forward by the legal -- by that legal opinion and by those 19 individuals which has intervened now and stopped things.
But what else are they willing to consider or act on to back up the kind of rhetoric that the Prime Minister used today.
That's where I envision the conversation going past today.
Those are fair questions for the Prime Minister.
He sdrnl a lot of answers on that today.
At the same time, his language today was very clear.
I don't think there is a chance in the world that they are going to look that the option put forth by that greenspon legal opinion or what is suggested in that letter by those 19 individuals.



**Rosemary**:

Or even now by china.
China making the suggestion that a swap of some kind would be possible and confirms what the government has been saying from the beginning, Catherine.
and that is that this is a tit-for-tat situation.
That these two men have been arbitrarily detained.
That the reason they were arrested was because of meng wanzhou and that detention and extradition order.
I mean, china has now made that -- has made that connection very clear and so the Prime Minister then can actually use that, I think, in his language to admonish the chinese for doing that.
For making this arbitrary detention that he would suggest has nothing to do with anything else.



**Reporter**:

and certainly he has been saying that it is obvious for Canadian that that has been linked for some time and following ON what Vassy just said.
The Prime Minister didn't just close the door today to releasing Meg wanzhou, he slam ed that door closed.
and he has, in his statements today, really made it in many ways to reverse himself from that position because he's explicitly linked this particular course of action being recommended by these 19 prominent flayedians to endangering Canadian lives.
If we do, this it puts millions of Canadians at risk when they travel abroad.
That song entirely off the table.
There were a few other things that were interesting and I was struck early on when he tried to explain the balance that he is trying to strike here.
He talked about it as being the short-term problem versus the precedent it would set.
and in that moment, I thought you know it is very painful to think of the families of the two michaels who have to hear all of this and consider the fact that the situation that their loved ones are facing, I believe it's 563 days that they have been in detention in china, that it is ultimately on some level a short-term problem.
Now the Prime Minister did express compassion.
Later he talked about the difficulty of their situations.
Said it is a heartwrenching appeal and it is the government's number one priority.
But I think everyone in Canada really takes a moment of pause and considers the challenging situation that these men have been through.
As Vassy rightly said, the question becomes so what are you going do about it? there has been growing pressure on the Prime Minister to get tougher with china.
He didn't close the door today to sanctions or to revoking visas for chinese students who might have connections to the communist regime.
In terms of new move on the public front, we certainly didn't learn anything today.
It does, though, perhaps send a very strong message to china that if they thought the government was going to pursue this path, it is a no go.



**Rosemary**:

I did -- I was thinking, as we were throng him, that it did remind me of a press conference he gave at their first cabinet retreat in I believe 2016 where we learned that a Canadian has been killed after being taken hostage.
John risdale had been killed in the Philippine and at that point, the Prime Minister made it very clear that this is this was a government that was not going to pay ransom for Canadian hostages.
and I make that connection -- I know some people do believe that the two Michael's are essentially diplomatic hostages -- but I make that point because the language is the same.
In that instance, the Prime Minister said we're not going to pay ransom because we don't want to endanger the lives of other Canadians abroad and we feel that entering into negotiations around ransom would do that.
and this is a sort of the same point he is making here in a different situation.
and that, to me, is interesting because when -- although the government has this strict policy on not paying ransom, they do and have done in the past many things behind the scenes to try and get Canadian released if they are kidnapped.
and further to that point, and I'll go back to you, Vassy, it is interesting that Robert Fowler himself, someone taken hostage, is one of the people that signed that letter as someone who felted that he had to do something to get these two men released.
I think it is an interesting position for the government to be in again here, although not hostages.
They are definitely being held prisoner for reasons that nobody understands and certainly not their families, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

and I think, if I remember correctly, that was in kananaskis, in Alberta.
We were both there and I remember very clearly the Prime Minister saying exactly that.
and I remember in discussions that I had following that, you're right in 2016, so it wasn't too far into their original mandate and I remember the next six months, picking the brains of people who surround him and telling me by far and away that is the hardest thing that he had to say and do as Prime Minister in that sort of beginning part of his mandate.
and it had weighed only them and is that government.
The second point I have --



**Rosemary**:

Can I say to correct myself that both men were killed.
I think I suggested they weren't. Yeah.
John rizdale and Robert hall.
Both men were killed in the Philippines by terrorists.



I remember covering it. I remember the sort of apprehension as they said what does that mean? and it was not a huge amount of time between that awful outcome and when the Prime Minister had made those statements.
You're right.
He was as clear then on that position, which is very similar, evocative of the position he espoused today.
As clear then as he was today.
The second point I would make is other governments have said similar things.
Right? it's supposed to be a long-standing policy of the federal government period, regardless of party, in this country not to pay ransom in exchange for Canadians who have been taken hostage.
But there has been a lot of reporting.
I haven't done it personally but I've consumed it about as you rightly point out, the things that are done behind the scenes.
While the government is probably not paying the ransom, in many cases, it helps facilitate others doing so or helps organize it. There are many instances of that reporting, but the government has never really come out and said yes, we did a, b or c and confirmed that.
I think both those things are important to keep in mind.
I have found it particularly difficult to figure out exactly what is happening behind the scenes when it comes to the two michaels.
More so than even back then when I was trying to get information on what they were doing behind the scenes in the philippine as I recall.
There was a whole bunch -- the military was involved to a certain degree.
Intelligence was involved.
There were concrete efforts being made behind the scenes.
and I think it is more difficult, I find, to figure out exactly what they are doing.
and in the absence of that information is why you get conversations, I think, like the ones instigated by this letter and by these 19 individuals.
Right? one of the points that they make -- and it was put to the Prime Minister is -- because of meng wanzhou, because of this, there is a lack -- it has overtaken the government's ability to articulate its specific foreign policy towards china.
and this has overtaken all of that.
That is one of the clear points that they make.
and I think, you know, it's understandable why that point is made because there isn't a huge amount of information coming out from the government on this.
The reasoning I have is that that kind of information would further endanger michael kovrig and michael spavor.
But I understand the question as well.



**Rosemary**:

I think those parallels are very important and you raise some good points.
In this instance, we're not talking about dealing with a terrorist entity or even some kind of government of a failed or failing state.
We're talking about the government of china and the political context around Canada's relationship with china and the global relationship with china.
We look at the United States and the back and forth with the president of the United States.
Any concessions that the Canadian government and it would certainly come under incredible scrutiny.
I think that the broader political context and the fact that this is a state and a very powerful one that we're talking about, that is an important part of this dynamic, too.
and only further really complicated the situation.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
My point obviously when dealing with a major economic force in the world would be similar.
Things did happen behind the scenes in the case of the hostage takings.
Real, concrete things and perhaps there are things happening here.
I take your point.
It is far more complicated to discuss some sort of outcome here that would be acceptable to Canadians when you were dealing with a Chinese government that is unwilling to discuss why these men have been detained for no reason unless they can get some kind of, you know, action on behalf of their own citizen.
Which, again, as the Prime Minister has made clear, is really a part of the justice system and the cycle of how that will unfold now.
So, anyway, it's very complex.
Needless to say.
It's interesting to see the mounting pressure on the government and the Prime Minister this week because of essentially Michael kovrig's family's decision to speak about this, something they haven't done until now.
and that may speak to their lack of home or their sense of desperation as time goes on here.
I'm going put you both on pause for one moment.
Thank you for weighing in on all of that, though.
and talks now about volunteers, because that is, indeed, part of what the Prime Minister talked about today.
How young people volunteering over the course of this pandemic may, in fact, be -- may qualify to also earn money until the end of October by doing that.
Cuber seniors is the programme that pairs you knowing volunteers with older Canadians to give them the skills and equipment they need to connect online.
Obviously, especially important in these times.
As we heard there from Justin Trudeau, it's also a programme that's become important for young people because it could potentially be a source of money making for them.
My next guests are both involved in cuber seniors.
Jean is in Toronto and jay is a volunteer teacher and both -- oh, jay joins us from Oshawa, Ontario.
Good to see you both.
Appreciate you being here.



Thank you.



Hi. Great to see you.



**Rosemary**:

Yes.
So, jean, let me start with you as the senior in Toronto.
You've been helping volunteers get going.
You've been taking -- using this programme.
Tell me a little bit about your experience.



Well, I signed on in the middle of April because I was interested in improving My skills and I realised how little I knew.
I retired 13 years ago.
We have a seniors programme at our church and organized by Dominic weymouth and when we came back from Florida at the end of March, I said I guess everything is canceled for spring and he said oh, you should go on to cyberseniors.
Org.
Every day, there's three programmes.
So I have been on every single day since the middle of April and every day it's a different topic.
and I have learned so much.
and I realise, you know, cuber security, telemedicine, media fact checking, passwords, simple things like when you're on Facebook.
Don't get -- don't save your password.
You should log on each time and log out each time.
and you need stronger passwords.
I can't remember the passwords.
and I learned how to create a password that is very strong that only I will remember with about 18, 19 letters in it. If anyone wants to know about that, I'd be happy to share.
[laughter]it is mind boggling.
and the volunteers are high school students.
When I first met connor and I said where are you from and he said I'm from hamilton.
I said oh, are you at mcmaster? he said no, I'm in grade 9. and I said what are we going to do when you're graduating in high school? are you going to take computer science at waterloo? I said you know more than your professors.
[laughter]they are very patient.
When I was 15, I would not be patient with someone My age who couldn't understand.
As I said to connor at cone point, I guess it was google docs, I said connor, because any questions at tend, I raised My hand and I said, you know, I reported 13 years ago.
I had a really successful career.
I have two degrees and I'm a member of the order of Canada and I feel as if I'm starting junior kindergarten with a [inaudible]. can we please go back and half an hour ago [inaudible] could you explain to me when I scroll down -- I enmoo, it is a whole new world.
These young people are so parent and bright and kind and I've met people from Quebec, calgary, missouri, minneapolis.



**Rosemary**:

That's great.



and My colleague Cassidy who runs this, I said where are you? I'm in Toronto.
Oh, really? where? at bathurst and college.
and I said you're 10 minutes away from where I live and yet we have people all over.



**Rosemary**:

Yes.
Yes.
Jean, let me get one of those volunteers in. I'm not sure if she's done any work with you, but she's certainly done work with people like you.
Tell Mel why you wanted to volunteer and help people like jean out.
Really smart people that know lots of things, but just don't know how a google doc works or some of the little tricks that young people are just better at.



I first wanted to get involved with volunteering because with all of these cancellations, I wanted to do something that could help out in some way so I found out about this programme and I thought, wow, something that's so intuitive for me can really help these seniors and they pick up on it pretty well, usually.
So I decided to get involved and I just did the training and since then I've been doing three or four sessions a week.
I just thought it is a great way for me to brush up on skills and even sometimes learn other things that I haven't henereded and also just to talk to these seniors and hear about their life experiences as we just heard.
Bha*m do they mostly want to know, seniors.
What is the top issue or problem that they have?



a lot of it is about security.
So, some people will be worried about not sharing their information online.
So, we teach them ways so that they can be -- can feel secure that they're not endangering their information somehow by using social media sites or other things like that.



**Rosemary**:

and jean was talk about how patient everybody is with her.
What is your experience?



So far I think that patience is required.
I find that the seniors are really eager and some of them are taking notes throughout the entire session.
So they're definitely willing to learn.
and so I think that it's not as frustrating as people might think it is. There is a range of level and some people will help us answer questions and some of us have just begun.
Through all the people involved in the programme, they do want to learn how to use these things.
So, we haven't learned too many problems like that.



**Rosemary**:

I don't know if you would normally have a job this summer, but if this is what you're doing and we know that the Prime Minister is saying that there is volunteer work that might qualify for a salary of some kind.
So, just tell me a little bit about that.



I was going to be -- I was hoping to a camp counselor again this summer but that is not occurring.
We might get compensated for volunteer work.
Just because, a lot of volunteers would be having a paid job s.



**Marcy**:

What is the best thing that you have taken away from this programme so far?



That is a very, very good question.
I can't believe this programme is free for us. Every day a different topic for two months a different top tick every day for two months and we're still going.
I think what I have taken away is like telemedicine, media fact checking, it's overwhelming -- excuse me -- and what I really appreciate is the following day after the presentation, they put the whole power point online so what you can do then is go [inaudible] and review what has been taught because what they teach you in that 45 minutes is impossible to remember everything.
Especially if the topic is brand-new to you so you can review it the next day.
We started with about 15 people, I think, at the beginning of April.
and now we have 75 online and we have break out sessions at the end so we're with a small group and it is an excellent discussion.
I'm overwhelmed.
I can't express enough positive thing about these young people and this programme.



**Rosemary**:

That's great.
Did you know how to do a video call this well when you started, jean? or is this a recent lesson about how to frame yourself? I may have a parent who just gives me his foreheads when he face times me. [laughter]



Well, I was there three months ago.
[laughter]so you should -- I don't know your mother or father should join cyber seniors.
and the camaraderie that we have established with each other is an added benefit.



**Rosemary**:

That's great.
I will tell him to look it up. Thank you both so much.
It is a great programme and so wonderful to see young people and seniors working together at a time when everybody needs a little extra help.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

We're standing by and waiting for our briefing from federal cabinet ministers and officials happening earlier today.
Before that happens, I do want to talk about the third COVID-19 related death amongst migrant workers in southwestern Ontario.
There are hundreds of workers who have tested positive.
The province has announced a new plan for expanded testing on farms and also introduced expand benefits and worker protections.
Certainly the federal government early on ponying up, I think, $50 million to try and help the quarantine of many of these 60, 000 or so migrant workers that come from Latin America and the Caribbean to help mostly in our farming industry.
The vast majority coming here to Ontario and the idea was to help them self-quarantine for two weeks before starting work . in spite of that, hundreds have end up with COVID-19 and three, all from mexico, have died.
My next guest is the mayor of norfolk county where the most recent migrant death was reported.
Joining me from port dover, Ontario is crystal chopp.
Thank you for joining us.



Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

What has been your reaction to this latest death? and obviously it's sadness.
But in response to things the city could do or things the city might need in order to help -- to help these farms.



Well t death has been tragic here in Norfolk county and we've seen the other two deaths as well in Windsor and it is an acknowledgment.
We have to acknowledge that the federal and provincial programme has failed the workers and this didn't just happen overnight.
You didn't just have 150 workers that came down with this ill Bess that quakely.
-- illness that quickly.
What we have maintained from the very beginning is that the province and federal government need to step up in the same way that the British Columbia government did and take on the entire boarding process of the migrant workers as they arrive into Canada.
I think that they see it as a fantastic example of what can be done and, you know, if it's individual self-isolation that ultimately is the best way to protect the workers.
I think secondly, that the workers need to have the same services provided to them as other canadian.
They arrived here.
They don't have an ohip number, they don't have a doctor.
Our own medical officer of health became the physician for 200 workers after the quarantine process.
and I think when an outbreak does happen, that municipalities need to be provided with the resources to be able to deal with it.



**Rosemary**:

One of the things that many migrant advocates talk about is the need for these people coming up and coming up for years, you know, we do this on the regularly, for them to be made permanent residents so they're not fearful that once their job ends, they're deported home.
What do you think of that idea? dhaoung might also have a long-term -- would be a long-term solution?



You know, I don't -- personally I think that there is a lot of other steps that we could take before that that's necessarily the ultimate [inaudible] here.
Certainly in the context of their residences, you know, and these congregant settings, we know that this virus is extremely contagious and it is not fault of the farmer and there's provincial regulations in the past.
We never had a pandemic.
We never had a type of contagious disease previously.
It will be looking at rules moving forward.
It will better protect them in these environments that they work in.



**Rosemary**:

How important are migrant workers, temporary foreign workers to Norfolk county?



We bring in more migrant workers than any other municipality in the province and we've already brought in, I believe, over 3500 workers and I believe more than 1500 still due to arrive.
They are essential for food production and security for all Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

is it -- is there not enough labour in your part of the country? these people are particularly skilled at it. is it all these different things?



Absolutely.
I think they are skilled.
I think -- you know, I hate to say it but I think it is not the type of labour that a lot of Canadians want to do and I think our migrant workers come here and they work hard and to provide a life for their families back home.



**Rosemary**:

What are farmers telling you that they need to make sure that their workers are better cared for, better protected.
Some of it obviously the onus is on them.
For instance, there have been now just virtual inspections with farms and bunking houses.
But what kinds of things would be helpful to employers?



**Caller**:

I think part of the challenge with the screening process, and you're not getting the buy-in from the stakeholders that perhaps was expected from the workers and from the farmers.
So, the workers, I think that even though we're putting -- these pay protections have been in place from the beginning.
But the latest move by the province is a helpful step trying to crack down on loopholes that farmers weren't necessarily complying.
By think that, you know, there needs to be a plan as well for the farmers that if they do have a set that tests positive, what are the resources that are going to be provided to them.
To be able to handle those workers.
Again, the quickest way to be able to resume that work is going to be, you know, quarantining in isolation.
and they'll don't bounce back and forth between members.



**Rosemary**:

I know you moved into phase two.
It's windsor-essex that was stuck in phase one in this province right now.
Do you feel like you're ready for that phase in spite of what's happening on farms and in greenhouses?



The farm outbreak in Scotland, obviously mayor Hewitt and I were disappointed when we moved into phase two in the beginning.
The farm outbreaks have -- I can't speak for windsor-essex, but here is haldeman norfolk, they have been largely contained to the farms.
and so that element that I think our public health team here has done a fantastic job.
You know, with immediately getting into that contact tracing and so on. Why would windsor-essex, they bring in less farm workers than we do, and this is not a medical officer of health in any ways.
We've had one outbreak and they've had 26. and our medical officer of health has had more strict rules than any other municipality.
I think it is also, you know, it is shown that it stops additional out breaks here by minimizing the number of workers that are quarantined together in that initial quarantine period when they arrived because with a maximum of three workers quarantined together, if you can have one worker that becomes ill, you have only two others that you need to separate as opposed to a further larger outbreak that we're seeing in other areas.



**Rosemary**:

Really good points, mayor.
Really nice to meet you.
Thank you for making the time for us today.
Krystal crop of Norfolk county.
Officials are giving a response to COVID-19. This, of course, Dr. Teresa tam.



Over the past week, an average of 38, 000 people were tested daily with 1% testing positive.
These numbers change quickly.
and are updated daily and eveningings on Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Achieving and maintaining lower levels of COVID-19 is very important for minimizing illness and deaths.
But it is also necessary to allow public health actions to bring the epidemic under control.
If we think about cases and clusters like small fires and public health authorities as the firefighters, then contact tracing and quarantine is like the water needed to extinguish the blaze.
The more fires there are to put out, the greater the risk that public health respousers will be overwhelmed trying to get to all the fires before the wind shifts and uncontrollable blaze.
When epidemic growth is increasing exponentially as it did at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, there were too many fires that quickly merged into the big blaze.
This is why closure of social and economic spaces was required.
Much like a countriwide fire ban to bring the epidemic under control and not overwhelm the health system.
Thanks to the collective efforts of all Canadians and what must be our biggest bucket brigade to date.
The big fire is out and local firefighters across the country can now do what they do best.
Case investigation and contact tracing to control the smaller fires.
COVID-19 case investigation said local public health experts.
They will be conducting investigations to understand how people become infected and who they might have passed infection to. Contact tracing comes next and involves tracking down every person who may have been exposed to the case.
Either directly through close contact or indirectly in the shared space like a home or workplace.
The work doesn't stop there.
People identified as having COVID-19 need to be provided with education and support on how to self-isolate and not expose others.
Similarly, contacts which may -- similarly, contacts which may be few or many need to be provided with information and support to quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
Follow-ups need to continue for weeks until people and their contacts no longer pose a risk or spread to others.
The success of case finding and contact tracing is in the speed and completeness of which it is done.
The less case and the fewer contacts per case, the factor and more completely new fires can be extinguished.
That is where Canadians come in. By keeping up physical distancing and good hygienic practices and avoiding is high risk exposure setting like closed spaces, crowded places and closed contact situations, we can stop new fires from starting as we re-open.
Limiting the number of contacts that each half is also important as it means less fuel for any fires that do start.
This will allow public health and rapidly complete contact tracing and keep COVID-19 under control.
Canada needs all the volunteer COVID-19 firefighters we can get.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam Dr. Najoo?







**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Thank you.
and good afternoon.
Today a few woe on obtaining epidemic control.
But first, the latest COVID-19 numbers in Canada.
There's been 102, 242 confirmed cases, including 8, 848 deaths.
and 64% have recovered.
Lab across Canada have tested over 2, 518, 650 people for COVID-19 to date.
Over the past week, an average of 38, 000 people were tested daily with 1% testing positive.
These numbers change quickly and are updated daily in the eveningings on Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Achieving and maintaining low levels of COVID-19 activity is obviously [inaudible] illness and death.
But it is also necessary to allow public health action to bring the epidemic under control.
If we think about case and clusters like small fires and public health authorities as the firefighters, then contact tracing and quarantine is the water needed to extinguish the blaze.
The more fires there are to put out, the greater the risk the public health resources will be overwhelmed trying to get to all the fires before the wind shifts and starts an uncontrollable blaze.
When epidemic growth was increasing there were too many little fires that quickly merged into a big blaze.
This is why closure of socio and economic spaces were required.
Much like a countrywide fire ban to bring the epidemic under control and to not overwhelm the health system.
Thanks to the collective efforts of all Canadians, the big fire is out and local public health firefighters across the country can now do what they do best.
Case investigation and contact tracing to control this t smallest fires.
COVID-19 case investigations involves local public health experts, identifying cases through laboratory testing and conducting exposure investigations to understand how people became infected and who they may have passed the infection to. Contact tracing comes next and involves tracking down every person who may have been exposed to the case.
Either directly through close contact or indirectly in a shared space like a home or workplace.
The work doesn't stop there.
People identified as having COVID-19 need to be provided with education and support on how to self-isolate and not expose others.
Similarly s contacts which may be few or many need to be provided with information and support to quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
Public health follow-up need to be done to prestrenlt spread to others.
The success of case finding and contact tracing is in the speed and completeness with which it is done.
The faster and the more completely new fires can be extinguished.
That's where Canadians come in. By keeping up physical distancing and good hygiene practices and avoiding closed spaces, crowded spaces and close contact situations, we can stop new virus from starting as we re-open.
That's where Canadians come in. By keeping up physical distancing and good hygiene practices and avoiding closed spaces, crowded spaces and close contact situations, we can stop new virus from starting as we re-open.
Limiting the number of contacts that we each have is also important as it means less fuel for any fires that do start.
This will rapidly complete contact tracing and keep COVID-19 under control.
Canada needs all the volunteer COVID-19 firefighters we can get and smother the embers by keeping public health practices up and your number of contacts down.
Public health thanks you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Njoo.
Now to first Minister hajdu.







**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Good afternoon.
I'm here today with good news.
The interpreter regrets but unfortunately the quality of sound is not good enough for interpretation.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

In March, we launched funding for 100 research projects.
These projects are already showing results.
The interpreter is regrets that the sound is not good enough.



Researchers at the university of Saskatchewan have shown positive results from the preclinical testing of their COVID-19 vaccine candidates, setting the stage for clinical trial of this vaccine in humans this fall.
Today we are announcing funding for 139 new and ongoing research projects.
These projects will be supported with funding of 109 million from the government of Canada through the Canadian institute of health research and the international development research centre and from the research funding agencies of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.
Canadian can be proud that the scientific community has responded so rapidly.
While the process for most competitions take many months, in this case itself was done in a matter of weeks and there were nearly 1500 applications.
I want to thank and congratulate the researchers who will be participating in domestic and international clinical trials.
Scaling up promising existing projects that will increase our understanding of the efficacy of vaccines, therapeutics, clinical practices and public health approaches to COVID-19. Their work will help accelerate the availability of high-quality and realtime evidence that can support Canada's rapid he responsible to the global pandemic in other words to better protect, treat and manage COVID-19. For example, researchers at the canadian blood services will study the antibodies of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to determine and better understand the level of immunities they provide against reinfection.
At the university of Manitoba, Dr. Ryan zarachens, can I and his team will determine the effectiveness of anti coagulants in treating the COVID-19. and a nasal spray that could prevent infection in health care workers and others at higher risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus.
I know we've talked about this before.
But it is very important to say it again.
The work of these researchers is immensely important to our country, and indeed to the world, because the evidence they're gathering will inform clinical and public health responses, decision making and planning here in our country and all around the world.
Finally, I want to thank the provincial partners for their contribution to this investment.
We know the collaboration is what's getting throughs this pandemic in our country and we know that we can respond more efficiently to the global health emergency when we work together.
Thank you very much.



Thank you, Minister hajdu.
Minister qualtrough? hello.
Can you hear me?



Yes, we can.



Excellent.
Sorry.
Good morning, everyone.
We know that young people are facing a serious set of challenge during this pandemic.
Be it interrupted study, reduced work opportunities or disruptions to their internships and co-op plans.
That is why in April we announced a $9 billion investment in students that included temporary income support through the Canada emergency student benefit to help students who might have seen their summer job prospects disappear due to the pandemic.
We also announced increases to Canada student grants for eligible full-time and part-time students, broader elgability for student financial assistance by removing expect tanlt student and spouses contribution in 20220-201 and raising the max muming weekly allowance that can be provided to a student as well as a six-month interest-free moratorium on Canada student loan payments.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

The interpreter regrets but the sound quality does not permit an interpretation.



We are further bolstering our investment by $34 million to help create more than 3500 new job placements and internships for young people in high-demand sectors and sectors in recovery mode, focusing in particular on youth who face barriers to employment.
We are also augmenting our investment in the workplacement programme.
An additional $186 million will create 20, 000 job placements for post secondary students in their field of study.
We have approved 70, 000 Canada summer jobs this year and are announcing the creation of 10, 000 more because we know how tough the job market is for young Canadians.
This new investment of $61.7 million will get more employers through the door, bringing the total of c. S.j. Jobs to 80, 000 job until February of 2021.
We know from previous economic downturns that students and youth are the last to recover and in order to avoid consequences down the road, we're choosing to invest in them now.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

The interpreter regrets yet again she will not interpret the Minister because the sound is not good enough.



Thank you.
Merci.



Thank you, Minister qualtrough.
Minister qualtrough, just so you know, the microphone is a little bit close to your mouth so it is causing a popping for interpretation.
So, just remember when answers and questions commence, if you could move it out of the way, that would be great.
Thank you so much.
Hello, everyone.
As Canada's Minister of diversity and inclusion in youth, I acknowledge that COVID-19 has impacted every segment of our society and Canada's youth are no exception.
Post-secondary students and recent graduates are facing unique and unprecedented challenges.
The pandemic has impacted their studies, their ability to secure and retain jobs, pay bills and to save for school in the fall.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

At the same time, we know that almost half of not for profits are [inaudible] find volunteers when the need for their services has caused injuries and they're struggling to provide services to their communities.
and so we created the Canada student service grants.



Announce this grant will provide between $1, 000 and $5, 000 to post-secondary students and recent graduates who participate in eligible volunteer service opportunities from today until October 31. The greater the number of hours volunteered the greater the grant amount up to a maximum of $5, 000.
Post secondary students the, recent graduates and not-for-profits will come together on the I want to help portal.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

To be eligible for the grant, students must be either recent graduates or enroll in a post secondary education programme leading to a degree, diploma or certificate.
Students are passionate, engaged and ready to make a difference.
and we know they want to help make a positive difference in their communities.



Opportunities range from being an online tutor with pathway to education, being a mentor with , also known as big brothers and sisters, are helping kids throne code with kids code.
These are just a fraction of the over 20, 000 opportunities available on the I want to help platform as of today.
As the Prime Minister has said, youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow, they are the leaders of today.
More than ever, Canadians need their bold ideas, innovative solutions and their caring hearts.
I encourage all student and recent graduates to visit the I want to help platform at Canada.
Ca/iwanttohelp.
 thank you.
Merci.
and we will now take questions.



Thank you, ministers.
As usual, we're going to start the phone with three questions.
One question, one follow-up and then turn to the room.
Operator, over to you.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Our first question,  please go ahead.




**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

My question is for Dr. Njoo.
and perhaps also for Minister hajdu.
If you have something to add.
The Quebec government decided that it would no longer publish data on COVID-19. That there would not be daily updates.
As is the case right now.
They would do weekly updates instead.
However, there is still a lot of cases there.
and that is where the epicenter of the crisis is. Do you have any concerns regarding this?







**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Thank you for the question.
This is Dr. Njoo.
I think that it's important to keep track of data.
We need to collect everything in a database.
It's also important to share this information with the federal government so that we can have a good idea of what is happening throughout the country.
Regarding the province of Quebec, well, that's up to public health there to decide the best way to disseminate information.
I think that data information is generally well-shared.
But the public health authorities of Quebec are going to have to determine the best way to publish information to the general population.
I agree with.
Dr. Njoo.
You may have a follow-up question, please.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

is there not a risk that because we won't be getting daily updates, that quebecers will be less careful regarding COVID-19 and there may be more significant spread.
Answer -- thank you for the question.
I think that it's important to continue to raise awareness with the general population with the best practices and the public health measures.
This is what we always highlight to maintain physical distancing, appropriate hygiene, wash your hands, wear a mask.
If it is impossible to maintain physical distancing, these are all things font er highlight.
I think -- well, I listen to ads on the radio and the Quebec government is always trying to raise awareness within its population.
Now regarding data on epidemiology and what's going on, I can't comment specifically, but I'm sure that if there is a significant thread, I'm almost certain that the public health authority of Quebec will hold a press conference regarding this specifically or they will publish the data if there is another spread in Montreal, for example.
I think having a weekly update -- well, if there is not a lot of change, well then it can be fine if there is nothing concerning.
I think that the public health authority in Quebec will make all this information public.



The question was about are we worried about whether Quebec, you know, is only giving information once a week.
The most important thing, first of all, is that all of the good public health measures continuing to underline, to emphasize, to educate and to sensitize the population to what they should be continuing to practice, which is a social distancing of two metres and hand hygiene, and staying home when you're sick, maybe wearing a face covering or mask in public when you're unable to maintain a two-metre distance.
Those are all important things to don't do t. Certainly I have seen myself in radio spots in which they continue to tell the naubl these are important measures to continue to do. With respect to the data, certainly My understanding is that it's all right to give the data on a regular basis, maybe once weekly.
If there was a hotspot or something an unusual, an outbreak in montreal or some other spot, I'm sure that the officials of Quebec will be transparent and have a special press conference or disseminate the information in the public if it was an unusual situation.
Thank you.



Operator, next question, please.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question, Lauren gar diner with politico.
Please go ahead.
Ms. Gardiner, please unmute your line.



Just going to take the next question, operator, please.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Our next question, radio-Canada.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Hello.
Today we asked the question to the Prime Minister regarding the high number of deaths in long-term care facilities in the country.
Things are very bad and he mentioned perhaps having national standards.
What element should be a part of these standards.
How can we do better in these long-term care facilities if there are new cases? answer -- thank you.
This is Dr. Njoo here.
and we can see if Minister hajdu has anything to add.
I think we need to continue with prevention of infection, there were problems in long-term care facilities in the country and this is a national tragedy.
We need to do more to protect the health and safety of our seniors throughout the country.
and in all of the provinces and territories, we have followed guideline to protect resident and staff, for example, workers can only work in one facility instead of working in multiple long-term care facilities.
This is a measure that we can put in place.
Also screening of staff and visitors who want to go in to these long-term care facilities.
and using hand sanitizer when arising.
These are all measures that can be put in place, for example as well separating sick residents from other residents who aren't sick.
These are good.
They rat the foundation.
But all provinces and territories will likely create their own guidelines, their own standards.
Nationally, I think following public health guidelines for prevention will be at the heart of all this.
Thank you.
Follow-up question?



**Rosemary**:

Ok. If you want to continue watching this press conference, you can do so on our website, CBC.
Ca. a lot of questions there about Quebec's decision to move away from daily updates and will only do it now on a weekly bastion and have come under some criticism for it and the Prime Minister was asked about it as well and asking the premier to reconsider that decision.
Let's bring back Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen before we go. To circle back to the comments from the Prime Minister.
Which I do say, I see some conservatives in particular applauding the Prime Minister's comments on Twitter.
Because the language was fairly unequivocal when it came to his response on that her from 19 Canadians calling on the government to release Meg Lanzhou in order to get back the Canadian detained in khao*ifnl Vassy?



**Vassy**:

He was explicit that he does not agree with them.
He respects those individuals and they are people that you will recognize from ed broad bent to Lawrence cannon.
He respects them but disagrees with them.
In fact, the way that he characterized one of the suggestions made in the letter to end extradition proceedings against Meg wanzhou, they don't mention it specifically, set her free, hoping in exchange they'll set free Michael savor and Michael kovrig, he described as handing leverage over to the Chinese government and set ago press dhaenlt would essentially endanger any Canadians that travel anywhere.
As we've been discussing over the past few hours, it is certainly evocative of the position.
It is a repeat of the position Prime Minister has taken from the start on this particular file.
But it is much stronger and more specific language.
That is probably why you're seeing the reaction you are so far especially from the right which I say to offer some context has been the most critical of the Prime Minister for his positioning on china, arguing over and over again that the Prime Minister is weak on china, does not take a tough enough stance.
So, that is why probably they are, you know, at least supportive of the kind of language that he used today.
Now that the secondary question is, of course, what happens to back that up, if anything, and what kinds of actions is the federal government willing to pursue in that vein.
Those questions remain at this point unanswered.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
It is one thing to talk tough.
It is another thing to back that up with something more and for now we don't see that, at least publicly.



**Reporter**:

I didn't. -- yes.
and we aren't expecting Chinese officials to speak for the next few days as they're on holiday.
But that is the next important move.
and not of this avenue, but then what now to resolve this? what about the questions of precisely what is happening behind the scenes.
Any campaign.
The Prime Minister was asked today about some other options he has in terms of backing up that tough talk, for instance revoking student visas for some Chinese students who might have ties to the communist regimes.
For instance, sanctions.
He didn't point to any specific course of action.
In the midst of all of this, of course, these two men and their families now more than 516 days in detention, their fate.
It seems clearly linked to that of a telecom executive being held for extradition here in Canada.
She is living in not one, but two mansions on $10 billion bail while these men are in small cases by men who are eating out of a bucket and not leaving these facilities for days.
It's terribly sad and not a solution to anyone at this moment.



**Rosemary**:

Anything the government does or doesn't do, not wanting to provoke a further reaction from china that might endanger these gentlemen being detained.
Thank you very much for your coverage today.
Vassy kapelos, you can see here later today on her show at 5:00 PM eastern and Catherine Cullen will be on "the national "and undoubtedly elsewhere.
Thank you.
Appreciate it. I'm rosemary Barton.
You are watching CBC news network.
Let me hand things over now to My colleague, Susana meharchand, who will pick up our coverage from here.



**Suhana**:

Thank you, rosemary.
As we continue our COVID-19 coverage, we start with a look at Toronto where the mayor, john Tory is calling for numerous changes to the city's policing system.
At a press conference earlier today, he wants to refocus police resources and allocate money to areas
