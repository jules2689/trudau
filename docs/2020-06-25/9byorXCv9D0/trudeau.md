# PM Trudeau Speech



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Students are facing unique challenges this summer because of the pandemic.
At the same time, many are wondering how they can help in the fight against COVID-19. Today we're lunching the new Canada student services grant, while also contributing to theircommunities.
If you're a college or university student or if I just graduated, and you decide to volunteer this summer, you could get a grant of between 1, 000 and5,$000.
The exact amount will depend on how many hours you've completed.
To learn more about this program and find opportunities near you, you can head to the government of Canada website where today we launched the new "I want to help" portal.
Our government will also invest $40 million to create 5, 000 My tax internships for post secondary students as part of or $9 billion plan to help students during this crisis.
My tax is an No that builds partnerships between universities and industry with their training programs, internships and projects, they help shape the next generation of innovators.
Usually My tax caters to masters or pH. D. research students, but with the funding announced today, they'll expand their opportunities to undergraduate students and students in professional programs like law, medicine, or business.
For example, one of our their programs will connect NBA students to small businesses facing challenges because of thepandemic.
The funding will also allow My tax to partner with more organizations like hospitals, foundations, and municipal governments to create even more opportunities for young people.
If we want to build a strong and resilient economy, we want to invest in the next generation.
We have to make sure our young people have the right tools to work, innovate, and succeed in the economy of the future.
In this vein, our government will invest in Canada summer jobs to create 10, 000 new job placements for young people between aged 15 and 30. We also will support an additional 20, 000 job placements for post secondary students in high-demand sectors for the student work placement program.
and to make sure that young people are prepared for the jobstomorrow.
We're investing in the digital skills for youth and the computer for schools plus programs.
Minister Bains will have more to say even this later, but here's the bottom line.
There are fewer jobs and many co-op internship and community service placements because of the pandemic.
So if you're a student or new grad, we're creating tens of thousands of jobs for you.
We're making sure you can still learn new skills, begin valuablework experience, make money for the year ahead and contribute toyour community.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

Over the years, Canada has shown itself to be a global leader in innovation.
Our scientists and researchers are recognized around the world for their advances, whether it'sin the aerospace industry, artificial intelligence, clean technologies, or health.
and since the beginning of this crisis, he's been able to rely on them to help us to protect the health of Canadians.
That is why in April we launched competition to fund research work to stop the spread of the virus, and mitigate its consequences for our communities.
Today we can announce that we will be supporting 139 research teams across the country that represents an investment of almost $110 million overall in research on COVID-19 for the years to come.

**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Over the last weeks we've seen or hard work and sacrifice continue to pay off, and to continue on the right track, we need to be thinking not just about the next weeks, but the next months and even years, and that's what we're doing with today's investments.
With that, I'm now happy to take your questions.
