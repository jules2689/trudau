# Q & A



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?



**(Question by Media)**:

Thank you, Merci.
First question, Kate, bloomberg.
Line open.



**(Question by Media)**:

Good morning, Prime Minister, you told bill morneau to maintain Canada's triple a credit rating in his mandate letter, and one of the big three agencies just downgraded us. What does this say about your government as money managers an dare there any fiscal anchors let to hold on to?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

What it says is this inhistoric, unprecedented pandemic, we needed to help Canadians.
We came into this situation wit hone of the best balance sheets in the g7, and we put that to work for people.
We put more than $50 billion into people's pockets through the Canada emergency response benefit.
We have supported our entrepreneurs.
We've made sure through various programs that Canadians could not only protect themselves through this pandemic, but also hold our economic standing so that, when we get out of this, as we restart, our economy will come roaring back.
That was a decision that we needed to make because supporting Canadians is always the priority of this government.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

In this pandemic and this unprecedented crisis.
We had to focus on supporting Canadians.
That's why question we invested more than $50 billion in the Canada emergency response benefit to allow Canadians not only to make the right decisions to protect themselves during the pandemic and flatten the curve and protect people against COVID-19, but also to allow our workers and families and businesses to come out of this unscathed.
So that we can return strong after the pandemic.
That was the priority at this government, and it will continue to be the priority of this government, investing to help Canadians to get through this.
[ end of interpretation ]



(question by media):... suggested yesterday it would be open to swapping Meg Lanzhou for the two michaels.
Are you worried doing so would set a precedent and give beijingmore opportunity to blackmail you later on?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

It's obviously the first priority of any government is protect its citizens, and that's why we're working so incredibly hard to bring back those two Michael's who have been arbitrarily detained for particularly reasons, as beijingcontinues to suggest, and that'swrong.
But at the same time, our responsibility is to make sure that we're also protecting Canadians into the future, and if countries around the world, including china, realize that by arbitrarily arresting random Canadians, they get what they want out of Canada politically, that makes an awful lot of Canadians vulnerable to that kind of pressure.
We will continue to stand for our strong, independent justice system.
We will do everything we can to bring home the two Michael's and we will continue to do everything we need to do to make sure that all Canadians are protected going forward.



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

One of the fundamental responsibilities of any government is to ensure the safety of its citizens.
That is why we have been working tirelessly to bring home the twomichaels from their arbitrary detention in china.
But protecting Canadians means protecting all Canadians, including Canadians who in future may decide to travel around the world, including to china, and if a government understands that by randomly arresting Canadians, they can bring pressure to bear on that government to get what they want.
Well, then all Canadians outside of Canada become vulnerable.
So it is absolutely essential to remain focused on our independent judicial system, and to make it clear to countries like china that we will not endanger Canadians in future because of political pressure from them.

**Voice of Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau, I'd like you to comment on the study that talks about the fact that Canada's the worst country among the OED in terms of the number of deaths that have occurred in long-term care homes? what is your reaction to that? and also, I'd like to know whether in your opinion that will perhaps encourage you to introduce federal rules in thesehomes?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Well, I think that report has confirmed what we've all suspected, which is that Canada is not caring for its seniors as it should.
We have seen this from the beginning of this pandemic, whether it is through the challenges in British Columbia at the Lynn valley care centre, or the residence in Quebec, or the reports from the cafe about what's going on in Ontario and Quebec.
So we're looking at a major challenge in Canada.
When it comes to caring for and respecting our seniors.
I AM deeply concerned about this, and that is why for a number of weeks now, every Thursday evening, I have been highlighting that with the premiers and that's why we offered them $14 billion, including money for our seniors and vulnerable Canadians, so that we can improve the situation.
and of course we hope that the provinces will accept that money and make the necessary changes.
But as I also said from the outset, it also highlights the need to have very significant conversations with the provinces while of course respecting their area of jurisdiction and their own specific responsibilities for seniors homes, but it's important to realize that somewhere the provinces have failed to properly care for their seniors, and must the federal government play greater role? well, I think this is something that we have to reflect on. At the same time, as we collaborate with the premiers and the provinces.



Follow-up?



**(Question by Media)**:

Yes, of course.
This is an area of reflection that you have been engaged in for a number of weeks and monthsnow.
Do you think the federal government is now thinking more about imposing federal roles on all long-term care facilities inthe country? and are you advancing in your negotiations with Quebec on the departure of the army and the introduction of red cross personnel? yes, I can tell you that the conversations have been very positive with Quebec on that transition between caf members and the red cross.
As I said at the outset, the federal government will not abandon seniors in Quebec, we will be there to support the province and help it regain control in those long-term care homes.
With respect to the conversations that are continuing with the premiers, we need to do better for our seniors, and the federal government is absolutely willingto do more, whether it is through rules that will apply right across the country or withadditional funding.
We will be working with the provinces to improve things.
But it's very clear that we have to do better as a government, as a level of government, as a country in terms of the care forour seniors?



We will.



Voice of interpreter:



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We will continue to work with the premiers on ensuring or care standards are supported, whether that's by bringing in national standards, whether it's by extra funding, looking at the Canada health act.
There are a range of things we can do, we can do it in discussion and collaboration and respect it is the province's jurisdiction to oversee the care for elders in those long-term centres, but at the same time, what this recent report has shown and quite frankly what this pandemic has shown from thevery beginning is that the job isn't being adequately done in long-term care centres across the country.
We need to do better.
There are great examples of successes, but there are also some terrible counter examples, and we need to, as a country, and all orders of government ensuring we can do better by ourseniors.



Next question, operator.



Thank you, Merci.
Next question, Ryan, national post, line open.



**(Question by Media)**:

Yeah, good morning, sir.
Your rent subsidy program runs out next week, and we're hearing lot of concerns of businesses ability whether or not it might be extended, also as we're starting to reopen and starting to do business here in the month of June, they're worried they might in effect actually do too much business and not edged up qualifying for the subsidy, even though they were closed for the entire month of the April and may.
I'm wondering if we're looking at extending that program or changing the amount that their revenue has to drop to account for that.



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

As we've said from the beginning, as this pandemic evolves, we are adjusting their programs.
It is obviously that programs that worked and were designed to keep the economy shut down so that everyone would stay safe, are not necessarily going to be exactly the right programs for an economy that is restarting for people getting back to work.
That is why every step of the way will be adjusting and looking at adjusting our various programs so that, as you pointedout, there isn't a disincentive to hire or grow or be successful.
We want all companies, all businesses, to do as best they can to hire more people back, to start getting as much profits and business as they can.
We don't we went programs to have the counter impact of holding them back because they will lose help that they will continue to need.
This is something we are looking at very closely on the wage subsidy, on the rent program an don other programs as well.
We want fem to feel like they should be grog as fast as they can and getting the support theyneed.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

From the beginning of this crisis, we realized we would have to ad just our programs as things evolved.
Now, certainly, the programs we introduced at the beginning to help people to stay home or to help businesses remain shut are not necessarily the specific programs that are appropriate for an economy that's reopening.
So we will be adjusting to encourage businesses to create and create new jobs and hire more employees without having to hold back.
Because of a lack of federal assistance.
We know that there is a need forsupport, but we also want to encourage businesses to succeed and grow and that's what we'll do. [ end of interpretation ]



**(Question by Media)**:

Sir, on another topic you spoke with theegyptian president yesterday, the Canadian citizen who's been in prison there over a year, and his family is concerned he may have developed COVID-19 and is not getting appropriate treatment.
I'm wondering if his consular case came up, and if you can give us an update on that.



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Yes.
I can highlight in My conversation with president el-sissi yesterday, we spoke directly about the case of Mr. Albas.
We will continue to work together, and we will continue as a country to stand up for Canadians in difficulty overseas.
We are working very closely withegyptian authorities on this case, and we'll continue to monitor it very, very closely, hearing very clearly that voicesof family members and concerned Canadians about Mr. Albas's situation.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

Yes, in my conversation with Mr. El-sissi, we spoke directly about the situation of Mr. Albas.
We will work together and continue to push for Mr. Albas' return to Canada.
[ end of interpretation ]



Operator?



Thank you, Merci.
[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd lobbying to come back to themeng Lanzhou and the two Michael's story.
Now, there was a letter addressed to you by former parliamentarians, ministers, foreign affairs, and others.
and in this letter, they are asking for the release of Meg wanzhou, saying it will be a possibility, give the opportunity to redefine the relationship between Canada and china.
What do you say to those people?



I totally disagree with those distinguished Canadians.
I appreciate their involvement, but the reality is that releasing Meg Lanzhou to resolve a short-term problem would endanger thousands of Canadians who travelled to chinaand around the world by letting them -- these countries know that if -- if a government can have political influence over Canada by randomly arresting Canadians, that's absolutely unacceptable.
We have been working tire lesslyto ensure the release of the twomichaels, those two detained Canadians, but we will always stand up, not only for the respect of our independent judicial system, but also make it clear to countries like chinathat we have an independent judicial system and that we willnot accept political pressure, particularly pressure that can endanger the lives of Canadians with random arrests.
[ end of interpretation ]



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

I respect the distinguished Canadians who put forward that letter, but I deeply disagree with them.
The idea of solving a short-termsituation by creating a precedent that demonstrates to china that all they or another country has to do is randomly arrest a handful of Canadians toput political pressure on a government to do what they want, even by going against the independence of our justice system, would endanger the millions of Canadians who live scpl travel overseas every year.
We cannot allow political pressures or random arrests of canadian citizens to influence the functioning of our justice system.
So I respect these individuals, but they're wrong in their approach.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

Yes, as a follow-up, this is a point of law.
They're saying, well, brian greenspan says in his legal opinion that the Minister of justice has the power to intervene right now in the judicial process.
It's not necessarily interference.
He doesn't need to wait until the end of the process.
Do you share that interpretationof his powers? or perhaps you could say what your view is.



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

Well, I won't go into any legal details.
and I don't need to do that either.
Because whatever the tools we can legitimately use, the result would be the same.
China could put enough pressure on Canada to have us release one of their citizens, and that pressure would have been applied by arbitrarily detaining two Canadians.
We cannot allow china to believe that that's the way it can work with Canada.
Either now or in future.
We have an obligation to show that our judicial system will operate independently and free of political interference from china or any other country, and we have to demonstrate that the way that you want from Canada is not by arresting Canadians who are travelling.
That's an extremely important principle that we must follow.



**(Question by Media)**:

Radio Canada.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
a question on health transfers and support for long-term care facilities.
I was listening to what you saidto My colleague, but I'm not really understanding what you'retrying to say.
Yes or no, is there a need for federal standard to apply to long-term care homes in Canada?



Well, there's no doubt that there need to be more standards, there needs to be more rigour, and better protection for seniors in our long-term care centres across the country.
Things have to change.
There has to be an improvement.
Now, what form could those improvements take? well, I think on that note you have to have conversations with the premiers, because it is their responsibility and they are ones who are failed to properly protect our seniors during this pandemic.
Now, can the federal government play a role? yes, absolutely.
Must it play a role? well, let's talk about it with the provinces.
I do not have any desire to interfere in the province's areaof jurisdiction, but obviously the provinces need additional help in order to properly serve our seniors, and therefore we will be there to help.
How will we help? well, that's where our federation operates based on discussions, collaborations, andnegotiations.
and that's exactly what I will be doing this evening when I sitdown with them.



> you talk about help.
[ end of interpretation ]



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

One of things that is very clear is that our current system of supporting seniors across this country has not worked.
It is a provincial responsibility, so it is them who have failed to support our seniors, but of course the federal government is happy to be there to help.
We want to respect provincial jurisdictions, but I think we know things need to change.
Do we need national standards or dot provinces just need to increase their standards significantly to reach an equivalent level across the country? these are conversations we can have with the premiers, conversations we've had on an ongoing basis every Thursday night for the past 15 weeks.
The federal government will be there for our seniors.
How we do that, because of the constitutional division of powers, we will work in consultation in respect of the premiers.
But we know Canada as a whole, all levels of government, need to do better for our seniors, and we will be there to do that.


[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

But the provinces are saying there's not necessarily a need for more standards, there's a need for more money in health care.
I know you've increased standards and put $14 billion on the table, but the province is saying the federal government will support 25% of health care costs.
Are you prepared to say that you will do that? will you provide 25% of the costs to the provinces as they are demanding?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

I don't intend to negotiate in public.
I have said to the premiers of the provinces that, yes, we are opening to have a discussion that will continue this call on health care transfers.
I think the COVID-19 experience has made it clear that has to happen, but we'll also see where those conversations take us at that time.


[ end of interpretation ]



**(Question by Media)**:

Quebec has said they will no longer publish daily case counts, death counts or testing numbers starting on Friday.
Doctors are saying this is a lack of transparency that poses a risk to public health, and fuels mistrust of the public in the middle of aman.
Will you ask premier legault to change this decision, and what message do you think this sends to Canadians who are being told the risk of COVID-19 is very present?



I think every province makes its own decisions about how transparent it needs to be and how much it will provide data and information to its citizens.
I think there are probably examples, I think of Pei where there hasn't been a case in many, many weeks.
I doubt they were feeling like they had to publish case numbers every single day.
They may well do it. I don't know.
In Quebec, there's still very much significant number of cases every single day, a significant number of deaths, unfortunately, I certainly hope that premier legault would continue to be transparent and open with quebecers and indeed all Canadians as he has been from the very beginning.
[ speaking french ]



**Voice of Interpreter**:

I believe that first of all it recognizes that the province has different circumstances.
Prince Edward Island has not had any cases for many weeks, so we will not be publishing daily accounts and numbers when those numbers remain at zero.
I think that in Quebec, we are continuing to see new cases every day, and it's a question of looking at how the situation is evolving, and I hope that premier legault will continue to be open and transparent with the citizens of the province as he has been from the beginning, I think it was reassuring for citizens, and I hope it's important for scientists and researchers to see exactly what is happening in this pandemic.
[ end of interpretation ]



(question by media):... allows the justice Minister to intervene and stop an extradition.
Did you know about this provision when Meg was detained and if so, why do you continue to say Canada will not intervene when the legislative power is there, and iffure not going to use that power, what other options do you have if china has already hinted they would be open to a swap?



**The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau**:

We're in a situation where, first and foremost, the priority of any Canadian government needs to be to keep Canadians safe, which is why we're working incredibly hard to bring home those two Michael's who have been arbitrarily detained.
China itself has admitted that there is a direct link between the detention of Michael kovrig and Michael savor and the arrest in an extradition process of Meg wanzhou.
We have an independent justice system that is going through itsprocess, and yes there is and has been from the very beginning an element of that that involves input from the justice Minister at the appropriate time.
However, the bigger question is whether or not we want china or other countries to get the message that all they have to do to get leverage over the Canadian government is randomly arrest a couple of Canadians.
That not only puts Canadian in difficulty now, but put them in difficulty and danger in the coming years.
We need to continue to be absolutely crystal clear that Canada has an independent judiciary, and those processes will unfold independently of any political pressure, including by foreign governments.
We deplore what china did in arbitrarily detaining the two michaels, in directly linking those arrests which came a few days after the arrest on an extradition treaty of Meg Lanzhou to each other.
and we will continue to remain steadfast and strong and say very clearly in our actions and in our words that randomly arresting Canadians doesn't give you leverage over the government of Canada anywhere in the world.


[ please stand by ]



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

and I feel deeply for not just the two Michael's in a very difficult situation, but their families who have endured, you know, a year and a half of difficulties with this arbitrary detention by Chinese.
Hie but it is not just the two Michael's who have at question here.
It is every Canadian who travels to china or anywhere else overseas.
If the Chinese government concludes from this exchange and this interaction s that it is an effective way to gain leverage over Canadian and over the Canadian government to randomly arrest Canadians, then no Canadian will be safe going forward.
So I understand the difficulty and the heart wrenching ordeal that these two Michael's are going through right now.
But always, I need to focus on and our government needs to focus on what is going to keep Canadians safe into the future.
and to demonstrate to china that they can just arrest Canadian and get what they want out of Canada, even for us going against the independence of our judicial system would be absolutely unacceptable.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

I understand just what a terrible and trying situation this is. For the two Michael and their families.
I have spoken to the members of their families and I know this is very, very painful time for them.
But My responsibility goes beyond those two Canadians.
There are tens of thousands of Canadians who travel to china every single year.
There are three million Canadians who live abroad at all times and those Canadians would be vulnerable to random arrests if countries around the world, and governments around the world, were to conclude that the way to get what you want from Canada is just to arrest a few Canadians.
and give them some grief.
So we have an obligation to stand up for the independence of our judicial system, for respect of our international treaties and to not allow ourselves to be influenced by the arrest of two individuals because if we -- because otherwise we would be endangering many, many Canadians in the future.



**Reporter**:

There have been suggestions that Canada revoke visas for Chinese students studying in Canada if they have close ties to the Canada Chinese economy or that they target officials through the magnitski act.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are looking at a range of options and measures and continuing to exert various actions in order to bring back both Michael's safely.
We'll continue to work extremely hard and look at all different ways to ensure that we bring these Canadians home.
We have, over the past number of years, demonstrated significant success in standing up for Canadians in trouble overseas.
We'll continue to do everything we need to do to bring them home without further endangering Canadians in the future.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

As I said, we'll continue to explore all possible options in order to bring the two Canadians home.
But we will not endanger Canadians who may travel to china or elsewhere in the future.



**Reporter**:

Those 19 Canadians who signed the letter say that Canadian foreign policy is essentially frozen while the two Michael's are held in china.
Do you agree with that assessment?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

On the contrary.
We continue to engage substantially around the world and with china on many different issues.
But there is -- it is certain that this issue of china trying to exert political pressure on Canada by having arbitrarily detained two Canadians in response to us fulfilling obligations under an international extradition treaty is causing a challenge in our relationship.
We need to demonstrate that we have an independent judiciary and we'll continue to respect that independent judiciary regardless of the pressure put on us by foreign governments and that is why, even as we do everything we can to bring those Michael's home, we will not give in to these political pressures and compromise the independence of our judiciary or allow others to conclude that there are political paths to get what they want out of Canada's independent judicial system.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

We will don't do everything we must do to bring home the two michaels.
But at the same time, we continue to be engaged on other issues with china and certainly that is something that is affecting all of our conversations.
But it is an extremely important time for us to demonstrate that we will not accept being the subject of political pressure.
If it will compromise our independent judicial system.







**Reporter**:

Canadians have a lot of question about how the RCMP conducted itself as a mass shooter terrorized Nova Scotians last April.
Everybody seems to agree that answers to those questions are necessary.
But so far they don't seem to be coming anytime soon.
Will your government call a public inquiry into the shooting?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There is t obviously, an ongoing RCMP investigation into what actually happened in terms of the shooting is s. But there are many, many questions about the role of domestic violence, about the situation where the shooter was able to get his hands on police vehicles and kit.
There are many larger questions and we're working with the government of Nova Scotia to ensure a process whereby that actually -- those questions get answered for the family, for the communities, for Canadian across the country and we certainly hope to have things to announce in the coming days.
Ok. 



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Of course, there are many, many questions about exactly what happened in Nova Scotia.
An investigation is ongoing.
Looking at the circumstances of this event.
But there are larger questions as well in terms of the role of domestic violence and how this individual could have been able to obtain RCMP vehicles and so forth.
and we're working with Nova Scotia on a process that will allow us to find those answers openly and transparently and we hope to have more to say about that in the coming days.
Thank you very much.
