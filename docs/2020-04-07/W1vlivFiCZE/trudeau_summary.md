### Summary:


I've worked with Boris for some time now, and I know how committed he is to serving the people of the United Kingdom he is a fighter and he will be fighting now to regain his health and get back to the job he loves.
Health Canada is also recruitingvolunteers to help out our frontline workers.


[end of translation] over the past few weeks nearly 5, 000 canadian companies have stepped-up to fight COVID-19. On behalf of all Canadians, thank you for stepping up. To keep our frontline workers safe from COVID-19, we need a sustainable and stable supply ofthese products, and that means making them at home.
We're working with thornhill, medical, c. a.o., ventilators forcanadians, and a group led by starfish medical to produce up to 30, 000 made-in-Canada ventilators.
These purchases will increase our capacity to make sure these life-saving machines are made right here at home.
We're working with nobel prize winner Dr. Art mcdonald who is working on making ventilators that are easy to make.
and to make gowns in Canada, we are teaming up with over 20 companies, including acteryx, Canada goose, and stanfield.
For example, auto lives is looking to make medical gowns out of material it normally usesto make airbags.
 

[voice of interpreter] at the same time, our government continues to purchase masks to protect our healthcare workers who are doingextraordinary work.
We have ordered millions of surgical masks from a number of canadian companies and we support medicom which will increase its capacity of n95 masks.
I want to thank Minister Bains who is doing an excellent job these days.
Looking at what's happening in other countries, and I understand your concerns, particularly if you or one of your loved ones works in healthcare, but I can tell you we are doing everything we can to avoid that happening.


[end of translation] our government is working around-the-clock to ensure our frontline workers have what theyneed to save lives and stay safe.
Whether you're making medical gowns, delivering ventilators, or treating a patient with COVID-19, we have your back.
I know house leaders will be speaking throughout the day to reach an agreement for the houseof commons to quickly pass this legislation, which will give much-needed financial support tocanadian workers, while helping employers to keep their staff onthe payroll.
a lot of work has been one since we announced our plan to subsidize wages.
On that note, I want to recognize the tremendous work done by the public service, who processed hundreds of thousands of claims.
They're working around-the-clockto get Canadians the help they need as quickly as possible.
Finally, as some of you know, today marks world health day andnational caregiver day.
This year I'm especially grateful for our healthcare professionals and caregivers whoare working day and night to keep us safe and to care for ourmost vulnerable.
That's something of which we canall be proud, but our healthcaresystem is only as strong as the people it employs, whether you are a doctor or a nurse, someonewho keeps our hospital clean, ora home care worker, thank you for taking such good care of us. Thank you for everything you've done over the years to help so many of us start a family, overcome an illness, and enjoy longer and healthier lives.
We do not need a pandemic or a special day to recognize your essential contributions to this country, but I hope all Canadians will join me in expressing our deepest gratitude.
 

[voice of interpreter] from the bottom of My heart, thank you to all our healthcare workers and professionals.
