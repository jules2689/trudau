**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

My thoughts are with Prime Minister Johnson and his family during this time.
I've worked with Boris for some time now, and I know how committed he is to serving the people of the United Kingdom he is a fighter and he will be fighting now to regain his health and get back to the job he loves.
Sophie and I and all Canadians are wishing him a speedy recovery.
To our British friends, Canadians stand with you.
We will get through this together.
 

[voice of interpreter] every time that we hear someone has been hospitalized because ofcovid-19, we're worried.
But we must remember that we are not powerless in the face of this situation.
Everyone can contribute to the solution and you know what to do. Stay home as much as possible, even when it is lovely outside.
I know that it's even more difficult these days with springcoming, but we must continue to follow that advice now.
If we want to be able to take advantage of summer in a few months.
Only go out if you need to buy groceries, and even then try to go as little as possible and that applies to everyone, wherever you may live or what you do in life.
Having said that, some people are able to do even more because they have special skills or resources that we need right now.
For example, we are offering full-time jobs to reservists in the canadian armed forces.
That way, if communities need more support, we will be ready.
Health Canada is also recruitingvolunteers to help out our frontline workers.
a few weeks ago we asked for companies to produce items that are very much in demand now.
Since then, almost 5, 000 canadian companies have gotten in touch with us to offer their services.
On behalf of all Canadians, I thank you.
It's truly inspiring to see so many people wanting to help.


[end of translation] over the past few weeks nearly 5, 000 canadian companies have stepped-up to fight COVID-19. On behalf of all Canadians, thank you for stepping up. As the fight against COVID-19 intensifies, the need for personal protective equipment isgoing up. To keep our frontline workers safe from COVID-19, we need a sustainable and stable supply ofthese products, and that means making them at home.
With our plan to mobilize industry, we're helping companies to retool, repurpose, and innovate to fight COVID-19. We've already signed letters of intent with a number of partnersto produce the things we need, and today we have more good newsto share.
We're working with thornhill, medical, c. a.o., ventilators forcanadians, and a group led by starfish medical to produce up to 30, 000 made-in-Canada ventilators.
These purchases will increase our capacity to make sure these life-saving machines are made right here at home.
We're working with nobel prize winner Dr. Art mcdonald who is working on making ventilators that are easy to make.
and to make gowns in Canada, we are teaming up with over 20 companies, including acteryx, Canada goose, and stanfield.
What is great to see is not justhow many companies are producingthese goods, but innovating.
For example, auto lives is looking to make medical gowns out of material it normally usesto make airbags.
 

[voice of interpreter] at the same time, our government continues to purchase masks to protect our healthcare workers who are doingextraordinary work.
We have ordered millions of surgical masks from a number of canadian companies and we support medicom which will increase its capacity of n95 masks.
We are purchasing the disinfectant for the hands and health Canada has authorized thesale of more than 85 of these products in Canada.
Some products will take longer to manufacture than others, but every single week we are moving forward to increase our capacityto produce them.
I want to thank Minister Bains who is doing an excellent job these days.
I also know that a number of people are worried about a shortage of materials.
Looking at what's happening in other countries, and I understand your concerns, particularly if you or one of your loved ones works in healthcare, but I can tell you we are doing everything we can to avoid that happening.


[end of translation] our government is working around-the-clock to ensure our frontline workers have what theyneed to save lives and stay safe.
While looking to get equipment from canadian sources, we're also in touch with those around the world who want to sell to Canada.
We're expecting 500, 000 masks tocanada.
Whether you're making medical gowns, delivering ventilators, or treating a patient with COVID-19, we have your back.
We're going to be there for you.
We also have a three-point economic plan that supports business owners, including through new loans, while safeguarding jobs with the wage subsidy and helping those who nolonger have a paycheque with thecerb.
Yesterday evening our governmentproactively shared our proposed legislation on wage subsidy withopposition parties.
I know house leaders will be speaking throughout the day to reach an agreement for the houseof commons to quickly pass this legislation, which will give much-needed financial support tocanadian workers, while helping employers to keep their staff onthe payroll.
a lot of work has been one since we announced our plan to subsidize wages.
We continue to rely on your input and feedback as we refine it, and we will have more details to share very soon.
Yesterday was also the first daypeople could apply to receive the CERB.
On that note, I want to recognize the tremendous work done by the public service, who processed hundreds of thousands of claims.
They're working around-the-clockto get Canadians the help they need as quickly as possible.
and I also want to remind everyone if you were born in April, may, or June, today is the day you can apply.
Finally, as some of you know, today marks world health day andnational caregiver day.
This year I'm especially grateful for our healthcare professionals and caregivers whoare working day and night to keep us safe and to care for ourmost vulnerable.
As Canada confronts in pandemic, many have pointed to our healthcare system as a major asset.
Ours is a country where health is a right rather than a privilege.
That's something of which we canall be proud, but our healthcaresystem is only as strong as the people it employs, whether you are a doctor or a nurse, someonewho keeps our hospital clean, ora home care worker, thank you for taking such good care of us. Thank you for everything you've done over the years to help so many of us start a family, overcome an illness, and enjoy longer and healthier lives.
We do not need a pandemic or a special day to recognize your essential contributions to this country, but I hope all Canadians will join me in expressing our deepest gratitude.
I hope Canadians honk a little louder when your shift ends today and add another rainbow totheir window.
 

[voice of interpreter] from the bottom of My heart, thank you to all our healthcare workers and professionals.
Thank you.
