Justin trudeau's daily address on the pandemic.
He is expected today to talk more about the need to produce in house in this country personal protective equipment.
We will speak with one of the industry leaders working with governments to ramp up that made-in-Canada production of personal protective equipment.
We're also expecting today for quÉbec to release projections later of just what the COVID-19 crisis COULD look like in that province.
It's the province that's been hit the hardest so far and it's the same type of modelling data we saw in Ontario last week.
Alberta also expected to give usa glimpse into their modelling with the premier, with a full briefing tomorrow.
and of course the federal government still promising to release its own projections.
a couple of other updates from overnight and yesterday.
The Canada emergency response benefit which so many people were anxious to get going, it continues today obviously, but yesterday there were close to a million new applications.
Since March 15, there have been 3.67 million CERB claims.
Those include the claims for theemergency relief benefit and employment insurance.
Everything has now been tucked into the same rubric.
In terms of some good news because we try to give you a little bit of that as well.
In British Columbia yesterday they reported that hospitalizations and activecases have been flat for the last week, that the growth curveat any rate has flattened.
We know that that is something that is key to get a handle on the pandemic.
So that's a bit of good news.
Of course everybody looking to try to flatten the curve as thispandemic continues.
Let's take you to Rideau cottageif we have that shot.
That's the Prime Minister's homehere in ottawa.
He's expected to speak in 13 minutes' time.
Let's start with My colleagues the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos, and david Cochrane.
I like to start with some good news because that's important.
Vassy, what are we expecting from the Prime Minister today?



**Vassy**:

It sounds like the announcement will be good news and we have to see the details of it, but you're right, Rosie, it will focus on procurement andi'm told on the production of ventilators in Canada and an agreement with three Canadian companies to produce those.
I'm not sure of the timeline.
Timelines are obviously very important because those ventilators could be in need very soon, but the focus is very much on following the conversation we've had over the last few days, domestic supply chains, domestic production of personal protective equipment, and the medical supplies that are so crucial at this point.
So that will be the focus of the prime Minister's comments today.
Again, I'll be focusing on again as well the timelines laid out, if there are any timelines.
Also something to node we've been covering extensively on thenetwork, the hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The Prime Minister is expected to make some comments on that as well, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

That's great.
We'll talk to Dominic valitis Ina minute to get the latest on his health.
Our colleague mike crawly says that in I. C.u. Beds in Ontario nearly 2, 000 beds have ventilators, an increase of 50% since March.
There is a ramp up everywhere.
You can see people laying the groundwork for a potential surge.
David, I know you reported on this on "the national" last night, but in case anyone missedit.
There seems to have been an agreement with 3m.



**David**:

Yes, when Doug ford found out that 3 million n95 masks had been stopped at the border and only 500, 000 went through.
This was as a result of Donald trump stopping exports of personal protective equipment out of the United States, targeting 3m. Doug ford said we only had a week's supply of equipment.
FranÇois legault was also counting down his supplies, all speaking to the increase burn rate as more and more cases appear.
The absolutely critical need to keep supplies open.
We didn't know where it would go. Donald trump gave a news conference and said some things that needed some clarification.
He said he had an agreement with3m to get 167 million masks overthe next three months.
No indication of what that meantfor Canada until later when 3m released a statement saying the agreement with the white house allows them to continue their shipment of supplies so as not to cause humanitarian issues in other countries and they singledout Canada and latin america where they would be allowed to ship gear.
a big sigh of relief there as atsupply line stays open for thesemasks.
This is critical on the frontline.
This will be backstopped on thisannouncement today.
30, 000 ventilators being built in Canada.
Ideally that would be a lot morethan the country needs.
The other determining step, rosie, is the number of medical professionals who can actually use ventilators.
You have to be specifically trained.
It requires a team.
There has been a suggestion thatyou could do two or three ventilators instead of just one as things get stretched these days and even cross train peopledealing with machines to teach them how to use ventilators.
The human capacity as well as the industrial capacity of building these things.
That is part of that whole tilting of the industrial policythat we're going to see pay off today is these 30, 000 ventilators from companies in addition to thornhill medical, which is the initial one that produces portable ventilators.
These are going to be full-sized.



**Rosemary**:

Good information there.
This is preparing for the worst-case scenario.
What everyone is hoping, government officials, public health officials, and you at home are hoping we can get a handle on the pandemic.
Part of that is to practice physical distancing, stay home if you can, don't leave the house except to get groceries.
and then this new advice from the chief public health officer officer is if you feel comfortable wearing a homemade mask in a place you can't get social distancing, grocery store, transit, you can do that as well.
Obviously the focus is split here in terms of preparing for the eventual outcome, but hopingwe don't get there or getting the healthcare system prepared if we do get there.
As Vassy mentioned, last overnight and yesterday we heardabout United Kingdom Prime Minister boris johnson's condition.
We are hoping to get more details about that, but he was himself transferred to the intensive care unit in the united kingdom.
He has of course been diagnosed with COVID-19, and obviously thesituation is a fairly serious one.
Let's go to dominic valitis in the united kingdom, in bristol.
Dominic, what is the latest we know?



**Dominic**:

We had an update from the Prime Minister's spokesperson.
He was stable overnight, is being given oxygen, but is not on a ventilator and has not been diagnosed with pneumonia.
Finally one line to say the Prime Minister is in good spirits.
Some encouraging news there about Prime Minister Boris johnson's medical condition.
But of course this has all come at a huge shock and messages of support have been coming in from around the world all day today.
Early the queen sent a message of support to Boris Johnson.
His partner, Carrie symonds, who of course is expecting their first child imminently.
and her majesty's message read -- her majesty said they were in her thoughts and that she wished the Prime Minister a full and speedy recovery.
a message of support too, Rosie, from prince William this afternoon to Boris Johnson.
He said, our thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family.
He, like so many in the United Kingdom, and around the world are affected by coronavirus.
We wish him a speedy recovery.
Encouraging news there, Rosie.
We are expecting another update on the Prime Minister's health condition later on today in, I suspect, an hour from now during the daily briefing.



**Rosemary**:

Good.
We will stand by for that.
Obviously the Prime Minister did receive some oxygen, not on a ventilator.
What does this mean for the running of government? is he involved? how involved is he at this stage?



**Dominic**:

This is where things get confusing.
Part of the problem is the United Kingdom doesn't have a written constitution.
There are no written rules or manual or handbook as to what happens if the Prime Minister --if a Prime Minister, rather, is incapacitated.
Earlier as well as giving that health update his speaks person was keen to underline the fact that the Prime Minister is still Prime Minister, and that ties into a school of thought here, Rosie, that prime ministers are prime ministers unless they resign or die.
Now, Dominic raab, who is the foreign secretary, is now standing in at Boris johnson's request to deputize, but only where necessary.
That's because as well as being the foreign secretary, Dominic Saab is also first secretary of state.
That additional position has been interpreted to mean he is now the cabinet Minister designated to stand in. Now, Saab making decisions in certain areas, certain minor areas like appointing judges or ministers to the church of England is viewed as not too problematic.
When we talk about major decisions like military action, it is more so. Part of the problem is we don't have a written constitution, but what we do have is something of a historical precedent here.
If you go back to 1953, sir Winston Churchill suffered a stroke.
Ra ab butler, the chairman of theex-checker was appointed as the leader of the cabinet.
That is swinging into place, that the cabinet will make collective decisions with dominic raab AB the helm.



**Rosemary**:

Dominic valitis with the very latest on the Prime Minister's health.
We hope to get a briefing in an hour.
Appreciate it. Let's bring back Vassy and David.
Obviously those kinds of stories hit home because our Prime Minister experienced COVID-19 with his wife, now better and doing fine, but the Prime Minister still self-isolating tosome extent.
He made it clear the other day that he's doing well and has no symptoms, but he wants to set anexample for Canadians in terms of working from home.
It shows you this pandemic hits all people.
It goes after everyone and is extremely contagious.
We will bring you the latest on the british Prime Minister as wehave is more.
Let's go back as we wait for ourprime Minister back to the CERB.
I am getting tweets.
I put out the numbers of the huge number of claims that have been made and processed, but there are still people left out and we hope to hear from the government on some of those people, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I prime minister mentioned it yesterday.
We are speaking here particularly of people who aren't covered by the CERB.
The Prime Minister described them as people who are reduced to fewer than 10 hours a week or part time or those in care homes where it's more advantageous for them to go on the CERB instead of working.
The way that is to be addressed will be unveiled.
The Prime Minister said it's coming in the coming days.
The employment Minister said it could be part of legislation or worked into the wage subsidy.
They weren't clear on which method would address those people that are not covered by the CERB, but they are promising to do so. They don't want to introduce a new system for those people.
They don't want to take two weeks to test out that system.
If the technical aspect of the CERB is working, if the technical aspect of the wage subsidy ends up working, they would like to work within those systems to try to address those gaps, but again no specific timeline when that will happen, other than the coming days.



**Rosemary**:

That makes sense.
We're more than 24 hours in, but the C.R.A. Was able to process 1, 000 applications a minute which is fairly extraordinary for anyone, including government, and certainly beliesthe notion that government cannot do things quickly.
I guess they can in extreme circumstances.
You would see why they would want to use the same method going forward to capture people.
Obviously when you create policyso quickly, people get left out.
We're only a minute away from the Prime Minister so maybe thisisn't fair, david, but what is the latest we're hearing on the federal government projections because we're going to get that from quÉbec?



**David**:

We may hear that, but we're going to see there's a shortage of medical gowns and we have companies like stanfield and Canada goose making the gowns.
Companies making airbags and a wrap for a house during construction, they're going to retool to provide the medical-grade fabric that these companies need to turn these gowns into items for the frontlines.
You're going to see this policy in Canada that navdeep Bains rolled out coming to reality now.
The 3, 000-plus companies that raised their hands and said they're here, show us how, they're going to switch to making ventilators and people who make airbags and building supplies are going to make the gowns needed on the frontlines.
You're going to see the domesticsecurity that the prime ministerwho is walking out said we wanted, comes to fruition.



**Rosemary**:

It's the ingenuity of these companies making the switch, it's amazing.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
