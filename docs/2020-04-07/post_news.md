**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily briefing on the pandemic.
I'll start on the point where he ended and that is the serological tests, the blood tests, that some people are suggesting might be valuable in terms of determining who has antibodies within their system and sort of the level of immunity in the population.
The Prime Minister says they're looking at those, but there are societal implications.
and Dr. Tam said she is also looking at those tests.
Let's bring back Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
Lots of news there in terms of the production of different things that this country requires.
I would just point out the speed with which this has happened.
I would point out the original call went out three weeks ago.
Vassy, over to you.



**Vassy**:

Can I pick up on what you said about the serological tests.
Dr. Goldman has highlighted the issue on Twitter.
The Canadian company that produces and manufacturers those tests has been shipping them to the United States for use.
So the question is why aren't those tests being used here if, in fact, they can be helpful.
Dr. Tam and the Prime Minister said they're being reviewed.
Health Canada five days ago said the department is working with the national microbiology lab to verify the results so we can have confidence in the results and also to note the world health organization is not specifically recommending their use.
That highlights and maybe flags the relationship -- the advice of the world health organization and how it is incorporated into our own country's policy.
But I think the sort of driver of the story is that there are these Canadian companies and one in particular that is producing these and many are being exported to the United States for use.
and why are they not staying here.
That's something to pay attention to, how much attention is paid to it at health Canada and when and if they might be available for use here in Canada.
On your original question for sure, the ventilators, was the big announcement.
Up to 30, 000 ventilators being made by Canadian companies after agreements reached with the Canadian government.
I think the sailian -- salient points are, is that what you were expecting and how fast will they be made? the first question, we hope not, we hope we don't need that many.
The question of timing, the Prime Minister said he hoped they would be ready in the coming weeks and months, we hear that a lot, coming days, weeks, months.
Here he put a coming weeks and months on it. The question of need is directly attached to the increase in cases and the potential increase in hospitalizations.
Ventilators are used in the I. C.u. Right now we are so closely watching the curves in all the provinces and the numbers of cases in all the provinces to see when that surge happens.
The surge corresponds with an increase of cases in hospital and in the I. C.u. So will there be enough ventilators, the question is, for cases in the I. C.u. I'm not an expert in that.
I don't know.
It's also unpredictable at this point.
The question of timing is an important one if we see increases over the coming weeks and months and there are hospitalizations, we will see ifevery province has enough ventilators or if these being produced in Canada are ready in time.



**Rosemary**:

Or if they're being sent to surge areas.
David, to My other point, it was on March 20 that the government put this call out.
I mean, again, the speed at which this is happening by private companies is fairly remarkable, even if we don't know rightly as Vassy pointed out when they're going to come off the production lines.



**David**:

Yeah, it seems like this is well underway.
Will we need 30, 000 ventilators, maybe.
Will we need them all at the same time, that would be a nightmare scenario for Canada if it actually got to that point.
So I think this is an exercise in a bunch of things, prudence, innovation, economic development because this keeps people working and doing things, and the build-up of an export capacity to send to other countries so they don't get overwhelmed and swamped.
I'm sure south of the border, they could find use based on their population and what is happening with their epidemic curve.
With the testing, whatever stesing we're talking about, swabs or serological tests, the numbers coming out are sobering from our colleague mike crawley.
Ontario wanted to be doing 5, 000tests a day, they're up to 2, 500.
There is a lag in testing because they have identified, Ontario has, 13, 000 -- the lab capacity to process 13, 000 testsa day.
They're not getting the samples and what they need to test.
Because if you look across the world and we talk about the bestoptions and ways to deal with this, the countries that have done rapid, wide-scale testing and tracing to isolate and support those sick have had the best success getting this under control.
The lag in Canada's biggest province, compared to British Columbia, what they've done and how their numbers are bending.
This is something we've got to figure out.
We want a national model from the federal government, but if you're not getting a robust number of samples from the provinces, it's a real challenge.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, I was going to say, you don't have to go outside the country.
B.c. is testing at a higher ratethan everyone else and some cautious optimism with the curveflattening.
I'm going to put you on hold flavio volte is standing by. He says his industry and the government are working in lock step to get this going.
Good to see you.



**Interview**:

Thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me how involved are you and your industry involved in these 30, 000 ventilators?



**Interview**:

We're right in the thick of it. You talked about the call to action on March 20. We made a call to action on March 15. We said we could make complex things like ventilators.
Let's call the companies that have the I. P. and see if they can get in agreement with us. Under licence, can they help us manufacture these, the biggest Canadian supplier companies have been working on this since the middle of last month.
Almost all of those ventilator discussions are about when can we get them here and what scale can we manufacture.
Automotive is the only industry here that makes that scale and can pivot.
At last count we had 165 automotive and tooling companies that volunteered to be part of this effort.
a lot of them in contract with various levels of government to manufacture product, including ventilators.
This morning premier ford showed up a at wood bridge group in Vaughan, that is as of yesterday manufacturing level 3 masks and getting millions of them out a week.
The reinforcements are coming.



**Rosemary**:

It is remarkable, as I said, the fast turn that industry has made.
Do you have a sense of how many ventilators and how quickly you can get them out the door at this stage? is this.



**Interview**:

The ventilator is a complex machine and a lot of the sub components have a long lead time, two or three weeks for electronic motherboards, but we were part of the negotiations for delivery in the next few weeks.
What you will see is a curve, as soon as those supply chains get going and then, boom, they're gone.
In a month or so you will see everything we need show up. As they're available in batches, they will be picked up at the factory gates.
I know some of those contracts include deliveries this week.
I know places like o2 in Brampton, the work is already underway.



**Rosemary**:

So you're just building with what you have for now as you wait for the other parts.
How are the workers, the people who were doing other things before, feeling about how to do this now? I would think they're embracing it, but give me your sense.



**Interview**:

It's 100, 000 people who work in automotive supply in this country and most of them are on layoffs.
The ones that have been called to work on P.P.E. S and ventilators are doing so with anincredible sense of pride.
Our companies have established workplace protocols so we're keeping everyone safe, wearing P.P.E. S as they make P.P.E. S. but it's a sense of duty and canadian pride.
We've been calling it the largest peace-time organization of Canada's industrial might ever.
These workers, we'll tell them stories, I'll name thousands of them when this is all over.
It's actually -- people are showing up with a smile on theirface and saying, we heard the premier of quÉbec and Ontario say we might be a week away.
and our reinforcements made by us are showing up just in time.



**Rosemary**:

I only have 10 or 20 seconds.
Do you think this could be the beginning of a new industrial model in this country?



**Interview**:

I think if we think about these worst-case scenarios where we need things to save our lives and app development and I. T. is important, but nurses and doctors need things in their hands.
I think this will be a new shiftand a new embrace of manufacturing in this country.



**Rosemary**:

Flavio volpe, good to speak with you and thank you for your work.
We will leave you there on CBC television.
You can continue watching on CBC News network and CBC News.
Ca. [♪♪♪][ please stand by ]



**Rosemary**:

We are also today looking ahead to the release of modeling data from Quebec on how bad or encouraging the situation could get there.
There will be maybe a silver lining in it, as well.
It certainly has the largest number of cases in the country at this stage and those projections will be revealed later this afternoon.
For that, we will go to cbcmontreal news, Debra arbec.
Like here in Ottawa, people have been pushing for these numbers.



**Reporter**:

The head of public health in Quebec says the boss wants the numbers so he'sproviding them.
His boss, of course, the premier of Quebec.
If legault wants full transparency for Quebecois to know what lies ahead, but arudawould rather not release these projections and worrying ifquebecors are privy to the information that shows the peak is now or around the corner, they'll let their guard down.
He likes the end of April to astrology and what kind of model should we expect and how do we read them? I spoke with Quebec's leading infectious disease specialist who agrees it's very difficult for experts to create models and if the numbers are off, the correct is, of course, on theline.
She says to expect a best-casescenario or worse-case scenariois average.
Keep an eye on two statistics, the number of hospitalizationsand number two, the number ofdeaths.
She says those are really theonly variables we know certain.
County numbers of cases isn'treliable because of thesurprisingly high number ofasymptomatic number oftransmissions in Quebec and theywere largely underestimated andthat affects the curvesignificantly.
When I asked her if ourscenarios would reflect those ofontario, between 3, 000 and15, 000 deaths, she says youcan't compare the two provinces.
Tremble says she doesn't knowwhat the models will show butdoes expect we won't see acatastrophy.
We have 121 deaths in 885 cases.
Most of the cases in Quebec havebeen ederly people, people over70 and seniors homes, as youwell know, are hard hit withseveral outbreaks in the greatermontreal area and we'rereporting today three of fivehomes in laval are reportingdeaths.
Eight people have died at onehome and almost half of their250 residents have testedpositive and half of their staffhas been hit hard, too.
Families are asking forquestions, but they're notgetting much information becausethese homes are so short withstaff, their first priority istaking care of residents and, unfortunately, not answeringquestions from families.



**Rosemary**:

We will watch that later today and an epidemiologist told me last week and it stuck in My head, all models lie and some lie better than others.
I'll leave that with others as we wait for numbers.
Of course, we know that other places are also are revealing their modeling.
Alberta, you'll start to get sense of that later tonight wit ha special address from premierjason kenney.
Saskatchewan expected to release modeling this week and, ofcourse, the federal government promising to do so, as well, once it has a clearer picture of things from the provinces.
Before we go to the federal cabinet Minister's briefing, want to make sure to get in thisfellow, Chris day, a paramedic just west of Ottawa and he's apart of this specialty-trainedteam going door-to-door carryingout tests so patients don't have to leave their tests unlessnecessary.
Chris is taking extra steps totake stage but there concernsthere, as well.
Tell me what your job is andwhat you're doing on a regularbasis.



Well, every morning, we have brief video conference where we chat and discuss the plan of the day, but we working in partnership with public health, with the metro county health unit and so everyday thatthey're doing screening, phonecalls, they send us requisitions for swabbing that needs to get done all across the county.
So we put together a list of the people that need to get swabbed that day and then we're out in the community doing those kind of swabs.
So whether it's a nasal swab or oral swab, we going right intopeople's homes and doing it right there and trying to keep people in their homes as much as possible so that we'rerespecting the guidelines of social distancing and not having people travel to us.



**Rosemary**:

and that makes allot of sense because we'reobviously not trying to bring it into health centres or hospitals or cling.
Clinics.
What does that mean for? because you're going intosomeone's home showing symptoms of COVID-19. How worried are you?



It's definitely on the front of your mind, your whole workday.
We take precautions and have as potter with us so we have our face shields, goggles, masks and gowns and gloves and someone is there watching us to see we'redoing it safely.
After we come out of the home, after we collected the sample, they're we're properly doffing our equipment and following one step at a time and that we are doing it in a complete, safe manner and that tries to reduce and mitigate the risks to us.



Chris, the deputy Prime Minister is speaking, but I want to take 30 seconds if you'reworried about your health, yourfamily's health and how you'redealing with that.



Absolutely.
We've taking precautions here athome.
I've moved down in the basement so I'm away from the rest of thefamily.
I go to work in street clothes, go come home in street clothe sand nothing comes home.
By being down in the basement, I'm able to separate myself.
So if I should at any point, youknow, show any signs orsymptoms, then we keep that distance from the rest of the family getting sick.



Well, that's prettyextraordinary.
In case no one has told youlately, thank you, appreciateit.



You're welcome.
The rest of the community paramedics throughout the community are working very hard and we're trying to take some of the load off the front-linecrews and so it's a great teameffort by everyone involved.



Keep at it and healthy and safe and same to your family.
Chris day is an ontarioparamedic in renfrey county.
Now let's to go chrystiafreeland with a daily update.
(speaking french).



This year celebrations will seem different but it is absolutely necessary for us to continue to follow the rules in order to protect our families and our neighbours.



We are going to hear fromcanada's chief public healthofficer, Dr. Theresa tam, the minister of health and the minister of innovation, science and history.
.and with us is our deputy publcchief officer, Dr. Howard Njooto answer questions.
Dr. Tam, please.



Hello, everyone.
(speaking french).



Hello, everyone.



With an update on the number of COVID-19 cases in Canada.
There are 7, 300 cases, including345 deaths.
On the lab front we have completed testing for over346, 000 people in Canada.
Of these, 5% are confirmed aspositive.
So we are able to track where the spread is occurring.
There are numerous outbreaks inhigh-risk settings, as well assevere outcomes in vulnerablepeople and these settingsinclude long-term care, hospitaland correctional facilities, butalso an increasing number offirst nations in one inuitcommunity.
a single case in any metiscommunity is high cause concern.
They are among the mostvulnerable to COVID-19 due todistances, access to necessaryresources and underlying healthconditions.
In response to the heightenedrisk, I'm heartened to hear thatleaders of the communities aretaking to protect theirpopulation and we need to ordereverything we can to slow thespread of this epidemic andprotect all vulnerablecanadians.
We've talked a lot about masksover the last few days executiveand iwant to make a few importatpoints.
(speaking french).



I want to start by saying that medical masks are in short supply all over the world and they must be conserved for healthcare workers and other people providing direct care TA COVID-19 patient.
Wearing a non medical mask or facial covering can be additional layer to protect and not infect others.
Even if you are not currentlysymptomatic.
This can help reduce the spread of respiratory droplets to others when you can't maintain physical distancing of two metres from others, such as while you're on public transit or getting groceries.
However, wearing a face covering does not preclude the need for frequent hand hygiene and physical distancing.
Without frequent hand washing and physical distancing, you cannot consider yourself protected against COVID-19.



Medical masks must be conserved for healthcare worker sand others providing care to acovid patient.

Without these, you cannot consider yourself protected fromcovid-19 but faces coverings are not protective for everything orages.
It could present a suffocation risk and anyone who has difficult breathing and anyone unable to remove the mask bythemselves.
So thank you.



Thank you, very much, deputy prime Minister.



We're with the families of those who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and I want to thank the companies that are working so hard to retool, re purpose and innovate to fight this diseasetogether.
and this is what it means to Beau Canadian, coming together to keep our community safe andstrong, to help protect ourfront-line healthcare workersand save the lives of canadianswho become severely ill withcovid-19. and I also want to emphasize asmany others have said here todaythat we all have a veryimportant role to play to defeatthis virus.
As it gets warmer outside andwith religious celebrations likeeaster and passover, and ramadancoming, it's important to keepavoid gathering with others andthis means that we'll have topostpone our barbecues and ourfamily dinners for now.
So stay at home, don't inviteothers to your house, even ifthey are members of your ownfamily, limit your comings andgoings and if you must, keep atwo metre distance, ahockey-stick length and use thecovid-19 app to learn how toprotect yourself and others.
All Canadians have an importantrole getting through thisdifficult time.
Thank you.



Thank you, and we will now hear from the Minister of public services and procurement.
(speaking french).



Hello, everything.
My thoughts are with those who are suffering and those who have lost loved ones.
As we continue to work in this truly extraordinary situation, want to thank the weeks that are working day in and day out to ensure that Canadians will have the equipment they need.
Your work is essential to the efforts against COVID-19 and we are extremely grateful.
Public services and procurementcanada is aggressively and proactively buying in bulk fro mall available suppliers anddistributers.
(speaking french).



As the prime ministermentioned, there was a delivery from china yesterday.
We received approximately eight million surgical masks and orders made directly by novascotia and Quebec who were also on board.
We are expecting more deliveries in the days and weeks to come.
As the Prime Minister mentioned, there was a delivery from chinayesterday.
We received roughly eight million surgical masks and orders made directly by novascotia and Quebec were also onboard.
We are expecting more deliveries from china in the days to co meas I will describe.
The reality is that we are operating in a highly competitive global environment and international logistics arechallenging.
We are working closely with our partners around the world including embassies, as well, with on-the-ground logistics to ensure that supplies can movefrom source to where they areneeded in Canada right here, right now.
With hundreds of millions ofpieces of equipment ordered, this is a complex undertaking, even as those supplies arrive incanada.
As the Prime Minister announcedlate last week, we have enteredinto an agreement with amazoncanada which will use itscanadian distribution networkincluding key partners, canadapost and puralator to manage thedistribution of personal, protective equipment andsupplies purchased thegovernment.
By thegovernment.
As part of our efforts to ensurethese supplies are deliveredabsolutely as fast as possiblewhen they are ready to ship, amazon is providing theseservices to Canadians at costwithout profit.
(speaking french).



When it comes to collaboration betweenjurisdictions, I can confirm that last Friday I held My first call of the federal provisional and territorial meeting.



This is essential to securing as many supplies as possible in highly competitive markets and we are working collaboratively together and it is truly heartening to see.
I would also like to note that we are working closely with all provinces and territories to offer space on our cargo flights in order to help them bring their shipments back to Canada.
The orders from Nova Scotia andquebec yesterday are examples of that collaborative shippingapproach.
As an update on equipmentordered, including this order delivered yesterday, we have sourced more than 230 million surgical masks to support theresponse, over 16 million have been delivered to date.
We have also roughly75 million n95 masks on order.
We expect to have roughly2.3 million masks in Canada'spossession by the end of theweek.
Among other suppliers, we have also ordered over 113, 000 liters of hand sanitizer, most of which is expected to be delivered thismonth.
We have received 20, 000-liters in the past 24 hours and are expecting another roughly ten thousand liters this week alone.
On ventilators, as the Prime Minister mentioned, we have relationships with caeventilators for Canadians and starfish medical for thousands more of these life-savingmachines.
There is no question that a lotof work is going into sourcingall of these health supplies andmany more supplies in Canada andaround the world.
But I know that the work doesnot end there.
We will not rest until thesesupplies are in Canada, in ourhands and ultimately in thehands of the many healthcareworkers on the frontlines thiscrisis.
(speaking french).



Our goal is to make sure thatcanadians have the equipment they need to fight COVID-19.



You can be assured we have doing everything we can, day andnight, in a challenging, international context.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, Anita.
and now we will hear from the innovation of science andindustry.
(speaking french).



Thank you.
For the last two weeks, the government have been mobilizing the Canadian industrial manufacture sector in the fight against COVID-19. In order to overcome the crisis, many are coming together to adopt new tools and new goals like never before and canadiansshould be proud.
Nearly 5, 000 Canadian companies have contacted us to offer their expertise since our call toaction.
We acted quickly to issue a call for action, to analyze letters of intention and to playordered.
I'm very proud to see in a short period of time we've helped to create new partnerships to secure a supply ofmade-in-Canada ventilators fromthornhill, cae and a group leadby starfish medical and thiswill allow us 30, 000ventilators.
These companies and partnershipsare leveraging canadian propertyand manufacturing expertise.
In greating these partnerships, we assembled an evaluation panelto run a due diligence processfor made-in-Canada ventilators.
and this is comprised of healthspecialists, medicalspecialists, engineers, informing specialists andgovernment officials.
We're working with Dr. Artmcdonald developing an easy toproduce ventilator usingoff-the-shelf accessible partsand the goal is to develop aventilator fit for current needsthat can be constructed quicklyand reliably in Canada.
As we've mentioned before, we'realso supporting metacom toproduce the boosting of medicalmasks and the goal is to helpthe company scale up to maketens of millions of masks peryear right here in Canada.
These steps will reduce Canada'sreliance on internationalsuppliers for masks andventilators and this iscritically important right now.
Here is another great example.
We heard that our medicalworkers were concerned about nothaving enough medical gowns tokeep them safe in the frontline.
The material for gowns has notbeen produced domestically andso we needed to find amade-in-Canada solution tosecure our production capacityand keep our frontlinecareworkers safe.
By engaging with industry andthinking outside the box, wewere able to come up withinnovative s solutions and turnsout some materials used forconstruction, house wrap and carairbags can be repurposed formedical gowns.
We're producing millions ofgowns with made-in-canadafabric.
What I want Canada's healthofficials to here is we aredoing everything as a governmentto secure the equipment theyneed to keep them safe in thefight against COVID-19. This is about helping thosereal-life heroes save canadianlives.
Thank you very much.



Thank you very much.
I give the floor to the president of the treasury board.
Yes, thank you.
I would like to quickly give an update of what is happening with the request for the canadaemergency response benefit.
Yesterday we got over 967, 000applications for the CERB and that is the equivalent of what the Canadian government usually receives in six months when it comes to EU applications.
Since March 15th, over3.6 million applications for benefits have been made and ofthose, three million have beenprocessed.
We are, obviously, very thankful to the officers and to the people working at service canadafor their diligent work.
We are also very grateful tocanadians who have charlottetowndiscipline and yesterday, we will repeat this for everyone.
So today, those born in April, may and June can make their application for the CERB.
On the state of applications for the emergency response benefit and yesterday we received over966, 000 applications for thecanada emergency response benefit and this is in one day the equivalent of what we typically receive in six months in terms of entrance benefitapplications.
Since March 15th, we have received over 3.6 million applications for emergencybenefits.
Over three millions of these applications have been processedand, of course, we are very grateful for the hard work ofcanada and Canada revenue agency workers who have worked veryhard, not only to receive but also to process theseapplication.
We're also very grateful for thecanadians for their discipline yesterday and we remind everyone born in April, may and June, they can also submit their application for the canadaemergency response benefit.



Thank you.
We are ready to answer yourquestions.



There are questions on the phone before turning to theroom.
Operator.



Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
(speaking french).



The first question is from tvnuvelle.
Question, this is a question for minister Bains.
You can answer if English, if you wish.
I just want to know this, before the ventilators, there are30, 000 that will be made here incanada.
Can you tell us how long, approximately, it will take to get them? is it a question of week or More question of months? yes, thank you for yourquestion.
I think that with the system as it stands now, we can get essential equipment in a matter of weeks.
We can see the production of these ventilators for canadianuse.
(speaking french).



Thank you, another question for miss Freeland.
So yes, the issue of masks from the 3m company in the United States, that company has been solved, but the prime Minister seemed to imply that there could be other problems in the coming weeks and months with other types of medical equipment.
Have there been anynegotiations? we know that there are some areas in the United States that more ventilators.
Have you negotiated and are we ready to send them something in exchange so that we can get what we need for our healthcareworkers? answer, thank you for yourquestion.
We truly did find a good solution with 3m and I want to thank 3m and our americanpartners and neighbours and all of the team in Canada who worked on that.
With regard to the future, we told our American partners that we have a mutual relationship that is very balanced when it comes to medical care andservices.
We are interdependent and the best results for Canada and for the United States is to continue to work together.
Our partners agreed and we can see that with the results that we obtained yesterday.
and we will continue to work with our partners using that argument and we won't only use that argument, but we will also truly work together.
We did have a good outcome yesterday with the 3m masks.
It was a really team canadaeffort.
a lot of people were involved and I would like to thank the leaders of 3m who have be enacting in a really responsible way and also, of course, ouramerican partners.
We achieved that result by making the case to our americanfriends and neighbours that when it comes to medical equipment and medical services, the relationship between Canada and the United States is one ofinterdependence.
It is a reciprocal relationship and both countries do best when we work together and that's why we were able to achieve awin-win outcome.
That will be the argument thatwe continue to make and advancein our relationship with the United states in these trulydifficult and complicated times.
I think it's good news forcanadians and for americans thatthat argument resonated with ourpartners and we're just going tokeep going in that vein.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Next question.



Thank you.
The next question is from teresawright from the Canadian pres sand your line is open, please goahead.



Good morning.
I'm not sure if this is best answered by Dr. Hammond ordr.
Hjdu.
I'm looking to see how many ventilators we have in canadaright now and how many you believe we will need.



So the actual ventilator capacity within the responsibility of theparliaments, of course.
They've canceled elected surgeries to make sure there'scapacity in the icus.
We have provided ventilators TA whole number of parliament sand territories and we are acquiring more as you've heard.
So before any requests were made by provinces and territories, we preemptively already purchased another 600, close to 600, andthen, of course, all of the innovation of the channeling of acquisition came into play, as well.
But I think it's an area that you have to monitor in a dynamicway, because everyday there will be people admitted to ictus and available of ICU beds will be based on local epidemiology an dhow many people are sick in thatarea.
So it's not an even distribution in terms of capacity on any given day.



and also, Dr. Tam, I'mwondering if you could talk about the science for the data that you've looked at in terms of the demographics of the people who are being most impacted by this illness.
I'm talking about gender, race, socioeconomic status.
Are you collecting this data and what is it telling you?



Yes, we are collecting this information and the detailed information is actually available on our website.
We do know that certain group shave a lot of impact in terms of severe and death.
and those are people in the older age groups.
and so in terms of death, the vast majority and over 92 92% of deaths of those 62 or older and think that reflects some of the epidemiology we're seeing where the average age of the residents are quite high andthat's why we're seeing that impact right now.
and in terms ofhospitalizations, again, it'sgeared to the older age group sand we know that it has been approximately 60% of hospitalizations are over the age of 60, but we have seen younger age groups impacted for sure and with even young people, 20s and 30s, several of those very tragic reports are people in those age groups also havingfatalities.
and another way is to track icuadmissions.
We have about, of the case reports we received, about 5%have been admitted to ICU.
I would say overall, the gender distribution or the sex, maleto-female, is equal and anotherphenomenon to remember is that, in fact, is adults, particularlythe working age group, adultshave the most illnessesreported.
But the severity of illness isskewed towards the older agegroups.



Thank you, next question.



Thank you.
(speaking french).



The next question is fromradio-Canada.
Please go ahead.



Thank you very much for this opportunity to ask My question.
So the Prime Minister announced this morning that Canada would be producing ventilators and other equipment domestically andi'm wondering how long do you think that Canada will be able to count on this domestic market to meet its needs for various types of equipment, not onlyventilators? will we always have to count on the international market and to what extent? answer, thank you for yourquestion.
We have a clear strategy andit's buy, buy, buy, and make, make, make.
It is a very clear strategy.
and that is why we created Alan to make ventilators and other essential equipment herein Canada.
What extent and what percentage? it's difficult to determine that right now, but we will continue to work everyday to see what capacity we have here in Canada.
But we also have a strategy to accumulate the necessary equipment because it's not only necessary for Canadians but for other countries, as well.
Thank you, Minister.
Followup question.
Yes, thank you.
Question, should Canada have successive waves, a bit likeontario was suggesting lastweek? this is Dr. Njoom.
It's hard to predict what will happen in the future, but think it's important to pay attention to what will happen in the coming weeks.
We have expecting good news if everyone continues to practise physical distancing in Canada.
and with the entire population being motivated, well, that is an important factor and thenwe'll see what impact that will have on the future.



We'll turn to the room starting with molly from CTV.



Minister, you talked about the sourcing, and does sourcing mean a guarantee those will come into the country? and can you help me understand roughly timeline when we'relooking at 230 million surgicalmasks, 75 million n 95 masks? because we're sitting in province where the premier saidwe'll run out of masks by nextweek?



Thank you for the question.
I want to begin by saying we'reoperating in a very fluid an devolving market for ppe.
Every single day we are aggressively ordering in thismarketplace, but we must recognise that are risks posed by fragile supply chains and there is a fluidity of this current situation that must be understood in this period of exceptionally high demand.
In terms of your question relating to supplies andtimelines, ordering, of course does not guarantee a delivery.
Ordering means that we have placed an order and contract for products that we need to make sure find their way back tocanada.
and in order to make sure that goods find their way back tocanada, we are taking very serious steps on the ground, into make sure it meets the requirement that countries have before the leave thejurisdiction.
For example, in china, we have engaged our embassy on the ground in efforts to ensure our orders are delivered on schedule and those parties are also identifying new opportunities for us. We are also engaging directly with manufacturers on the ground in china.
We are also engaged with private firms who are assisting us with quality assurance, opportunities in country logistics, arranging transportation and, for example, assisting us in leasing aware house in shanghai that can store goods once they are sourced and ready to export.
Finally, we are arranging our own transportation from Canada.
You've been told that two plane shave already left china and landed here successfully.
and we have another one coming this week.
and you can see these supply chains are complex, but we are taking every effort to make sure that we get those goods back tocanada and in the hands offront-line healthcare workers.



Difficult to give a timeline.



It is difficult, but I will say we are working on short-termand long-term timelines.
and we have 2.3 million n95masks arriving in Canada by theend of this week.
So we are seeing progress onthat front.



The second question has to do about ei. What happens if a person runs out of EU in the coming weeks? these people right now can'tqualify for that emergency benefit but we know that could be broadened.
Could people that don't have anymore EU in the coming weeks be apart of that?



Very good question and there are two things happening.
First one is the implementation at the rapid space of the canadaemergency response benefit which initially had the objective of being emergency not only in name but in action.
So we knew that the most important thing to do was to secure the ability of people to make ends people for those that had no income whatsoever.
Now we are moving into a second phase and the prime minister made it clear yesterday that we are considering other actions to help other people that may not have lost all of their income, that, in fact may be working in conditions where they don't have the income that the $2, 000canada emergency response benefit would otherwise provide.



Considering this is a globalepidemic, when will we know it'sover?



That's an excellent question and ties into what I've been saying all along, which is that we cannot fight this alone as one country.
That, in fact, it has to be global solution and why it's so important that we work with partners all across the country and you heard Minister bainsreference if we don't need all of the ventilators, they would go to another country.
These are the kind of actions think countries will have to take together.
If there is one case ofcovid-19, we are all at risk, because even if you think about previous pandemics, hundreds of years ago, they were globalpandemics, despite the fact there was less global travel, viruses and bugs have a way of making their way around humanpopulation.
and so the work that we do with the world health organization in order to partner with othercountries, to understand the science together, to accelerate the science and research as partner country and that organization is extremelyporsche.
Important.
Your question is a wise onebecause, in fact, what we see in countries that have crested their first wave is that they have to keep a very close eye on new cases.
and until we all have a globalsolution, this virus will be with us and we'll all have to work together to prevent its reemergence in any of ourcountries.



Did you want to take a jab atthat, Dr. Tam? consideringit's still just onequestion, though.
[ laughter ]



I think that's precisely thecase.
Canada will try extremely hard as we have been doing to reduce this first wave, but the global population is not completelyimmune.
So until the population obtained certain amount of immunity, we will continue to see this virus having the ability to hit anycountry.
So this is a really important point in terms of internationalcollaboration.
Finding those solutions like treatments and vaccines, ofcourse, will be key in the coming months and any time that we can buy for that to occur iscrucial.
Because if global solutions are not found, this virus could potentially continue to circulate for some time.
We actually don't know, asdr.
Njoo said, that we don'tknow what will happen, you know, after the first wave and in the months to come because there are different possibilities as to whether this virus becomes more entrenched in the human population like influenza, whether it would undergomutations.
So all of these things are unknown at this time, but every country in the world is affected now and none of us will be able to manage this withoutcoordination.



So considering all of this talk about masks, and I'mtalking about cloth masks, do you or Dr. Hajdu, plan to wearone, considering so many of us could be positive and don't knowit?



If I go out and can'tmaintain physical distancing, that's one option.
I want to recognise the evidence is not quite there but there is an added layer of prevention and protecting the spreading toothers.
and, again, it's not necessarily there to protect myself.
I think there has to be that reality check and the fact is till have to do the handwashingand still do the physical distancing as much as possible.
I think that is reasonable and feasible advice.



Thank you.



If there was not a way for me to practise social distancing, iwouldn't hesitate to wear that and with the direction ofdr.
Tam in terms of how to do it properly and being very aware that it would be a new experience for me. I haven't worn one yet and would feel like I would want to fiddle with that mask, given thenewness.
I think that's one of the risks about wearing a mask, is to wear it properly and to understand that it is an uncomfortable experience and there will be to be self-awareness to want toadjust it. At this point, I haven't had towear a mask.
I have been able to practisesocial distancing without one.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, over to you.



The next question is from Mira forest, political.
Your line is open.
Go ahead.



I think this is for Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
There are 500, 000 masks from 3mcoming in tomorrow, but I want to be very clear, that's not to say that we have a full exemption from the white house at this point.
and I guess further to that, are there other shipments coming in of n95 masks this week?



So just to be clear, and the statement that 3m put out yesterday was very clear.
3m has received clear assurances from the government of the United states that shipments tocanada will continue unimpeeded.
As the Prime Minister said, we are expecting a shipment very soon of 500, 000 masks and more shipments from 3m to come.
We have other pending shipments from other sources in the United States and we are working collaboratively with ouramerican partners to be sure that those shipments also can make it to Canada.
Just as our American partners are working collaboratively withcanada to make sure the medical supplies and services that the United states' services depend son from Canada can continue to flow to the United States.
I don't know Anita if you would like to add anything.



I would like to add that it'sa full court press on procurement right now.
So when a situation crops up with regards to supplies coming into Canada, whether it be from the United States or any othercountry, we work diplomatically and ensuring the supplies make their way back into Canada andthat's why I described that situation with china andchrystia has done a great job.
We are determined to make sure supplies get back to Canada once they are ordered and procured and that is our main task didn'ewon't stop until we get it done.



I'll be fairly brief because think it's important to note, as we recognise as Anita has said and Chrystia havehighlighted.
There's strain and stress on our global supply chain but we'relooking at made-in-Canada supplychain looking at domesticsources.
The gowns made in Canada, thoseraw materials are part of thelocal supply chain and thisfurther insulates us for otherchallenges that we may see inthe near future.
I think that's an importantaspect when we talk about it'smade in Canada, it's not onlythe final product by the rawmaterials that go into buildingthat product.



Minister?



Thank you.
and Minister anand, you mentioned 2.5 million n95 masks coming in this week.
Can you say where those are coming from.
But it seems low.
Do you realistically think we'llbe able to fill that order of7.5 million masks?



Thanks for the question.
Let me start off by saying that talking about the supply chain and the stresses on the supply chain at the current time requires us to be sanguine about can assure you that now, that the 3m shipment is coming across the border and will arrivetomorrow.



I can also assure you we have plane that will leave china this week with another shipment of n95 masks on it. Apart from that, I won't be able to and I'm sure people here will agree with me that we are in an era of volatility in globalmarkets.
and so every step of the way, we making sure that the supply chain can function as it should.
and where we see shortfall, we will be definitely relying on domestic supply chains to beramped up and providing equipment to Canadians so that we ha veins operating at the sametime, both domestic andinternational.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
(speaking french).



I would like to come back to this issue of masks, miss Freeland.
You said, I think, last week, that 3m is a very significant supplier for Canada, but I would like to know this, are there other American companies that provide medical equipment to us on a significant scale? and have those companies obtained the same exemption sup? answer, thank you for yourquestion, yes, of course, there are other American companies that are major suppliers forcanada.
and we are continuing to work Ina case-by-case basis to workwith those suppliers and, obviously, with the americangovernment.
Question, so I will take it fromthat the sameobtained by those companies? I would like to come back to aquestion a colleague asked about the ei benefits and I'm lookingfor an answer to that questionand I have been for awhile.
Benefits and whose benefits arecoming to an end or in a fewdays, those people will probablynot find a new job in thecurrent circumstances, so canthey apply for the CERB? answer, as I said in englishearlier and I'm happy to repeatit in french now, there are twomain objectives that we've beenfollowing since the beginning.
First to set up the CERB and tomeet the emergency needs for cadnot have had enough money tomake ends meet.
So we did that quickly and thenthe second thine we did that to go further.
We realize that the huge socialsafety net lets people drop to the holes in that net, so we'vebeen working actively on anumber of cases such as peoplewho, for example, might belosing their ei benefits.
Thank you, Minister.
Next question, please.
Yes, next questionquestion, My question is forministerthere is a lot of talk aboutrequests for procurement ofequipment that's been done inthe last week from abroad.
But I think it's been exactly a week, I think it was lasttuesday that there were60 million masks teenordered within Canada so I'mwondering for Quebec, can youtell us how many masks havearrived in Quebec as ofyesterday? answer, thank you very much.
That question is not just fromminister hadju or Dr. Tam.
D would like to say when weordered masks, we had to ensurethat the goods will actuallyarrive.
So it's not just a question ofordering.
It's a question of getting themin.
So for Quebec one would I wouldoask if Dr. Tam has something toadd.
We have an agreement with all ofthe provinces and territoriesand the agreement specifies thequantity of medical supplies.
This is Dr. Njoo and I wouldjust like to add that thesituation is very fluid.
Weve you exact numbersbecause we are gettingdeliveries from one day to thenext and as a ministerjualso said, we have an agreementwhich is a framework to allocatethe supplies to the provincesand territories.
An agreement between the federalgovernment and provinces andterritories.
(please stand by)



To ensure that all regions, including quÉbec have what they need, including medical equipment and supplies.
So it's important for quÉbec to be sitting at the table with everyone else.
That is the case and we regularly discuss these issues.
[end of translation].



I just want to remind everyone, this is world health incredible work of nurses and midwives.
 [ applause ].



**Rosemary**:

All right.
and that is the end of our daily federal briefing from federal cabinet ministers and public health officials.
Most of the focus hat press conference today really about equipment and procurement.
I'll bring in My colleague davidcochrane from our parliamentary bureau to talk about that.
I thought the best line from that press conference was from navdeep Bains saying our clear strategy is buy, buy, buy, make, make, make.
Unfortunately he only said it I trying to do here.
Minister an and is on the buying part and he is on the making part.



**David**:

Yes, heard what the domestic capacity is going to look like in terms of making supplies.
There are now four companies who are going to pump out goal is ventilators for domestic use and perhaps shipping internationally, helping the global fight against COVID-19. An explanation on timing there.
I'm told by a government official that they have in the stockpile what they need in the short term.
The first of these ventilators should be rolling off the assembly lousing what we have in place is designed to be a bridge before the capacity can fully ramp up. You have a company making airbags now making medical gowns.
and construction-type wrapping, they're going to use that for the higher levels of protection because there's different grades in medical gowns.
We're all becoming experts in medical equipment on the fly, rosie.
They are going to supply that toactyrx ando make this.
Now we have a domestic supply ofthe raw materials.
Not only made in Canada, but supplied by Canada, which further builds supply chain so udon't run into issues like the United States have had with the export ban.
You, Chrystia Freeland assuring us today, the deputy Prime Minister, saying that has been resolved.
3m supplies will continue uninterrupted.
But this government has a lot ofexperience dealing with the trump administration and the only certainty is the lack of certainty.
Who knows what other barriers could come up. a breakdown there of what they're doing, but also on the making side, rosie, an order, I show up, it's not what you wanted.
That's the big challenge trying to keep frontline workers supplied.



**Rosemary**:

There will be more n95 masks comes as well later.
Thank you, David.
David will probably be on "the national" later tonight.



> just an update of what's happening federally.
The Prime Minister announced 30, 000 ventilators will be made in Canada.
Timeline probably reaching into may.
a real move to protect the supply chain.
In quÉbec we are expecting the modelling projections of how Th. That is going to happen later.
Let's first go to the premier and provincial officials.
They are providing an update with 29 new deaths and 760 cases.
Andrew Nichols will pick up our coverage from here.
Thanks for watching.
I am rosemary Barton.



Premi [voic interpreter] there is the material to do the screening tests, the re-agents, and right now we have enough for six or seven days' worth and we are working very hard.
