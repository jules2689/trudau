**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I want to go back quickly to ask you about your decision on march16 to close the border to foreign national security.
The health Minister had been saying for more than a month by that point that there was no benefit really to doing that, itwouldn't keep Canadians safe.
You explained your decision at the time by saying that the advice you had been receiving from public health officials had been evolving.
Can you tell us a little bit more about how exactly that advice changed.



**Answer**:

I appreciate that your question is taking us back to March 16, but I'm focused on today and I'm focused on tomorrow.
There have been a lot of reflections on what has been done in the past.
We'll certainly keep reflecting on that, but everything I'm focused on right now is how to make sure people are getting the help they need right now, how to keep Canadians safe, how to get through this particular time, and that's what I'll stay focused on.



Follow-up question.

**Question**:

Yeah, sure.
We're just looking for some clarity on how exactly the public health advice has been changing, how the information coming from these officials has been changing and where they're getting it from.



**Answer**:

This is a never-before-experienced pandemic that is presenting new challenges every single day, newfacts, new data every single day.
Throughout, we're making decisions based on the best advice that those health officials are giving us. Obviously this advice is based on modelling, on facts, on what's happening in other countries, on what predictions can be made around what might help and what can make a difference.
As that evolves and the information evolves, of course we're going to keep adjusting and updating our approach.
We have done that from the beginning and will continue to do so.

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.
I want to come back quickly.
You mentioned earlier that a group of companies are going to be teaming up to produce 30, 000 made-in-Canada ventilators.
Does that mean that you expect we're going to need to use 30, 000 ventilators throughout this pandemic?



**Answer**:

What we've said from the beginning is we need to be ready for any and all circumstances.
The opportunity to make sure that we have ventilators available if we need them is going to be extremely important.
So we have told these companies across the country who have put up their hands to go ahead and get building ventilators as quickly as possible and as many as possible in case we need the min Canada.
We certainly hope that we won't be needing all those ventilators, but we also know that there are countries around the world where they are not able to tool up to create more ventilators.
They're going to be reliant on global supply that's already stretched thin.
If we end up making more ventilators than Canadians need because Canadians keep social distancing and continue to follow best health advice, that will be great news and we will have ventilators to share with other countries facing more difficult circumstances.
For us doing more right now and quicker right now is really the only option.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that we are in a situation where we must prepare for the worst.
We asked Canadian companies who have now volunteered to manufacture products, a lot of them, and to do so quickly.
We hope that we won't need all of those ventilators.
We hope that we won't need all of that equipment produced in Canada.
Even if we don't need it, there will hopefully be countries that do and we can hopefully control this epidemic.
Our decision is to do more and more quickly because that is what people expect.

**Question**:

As a follow up, I wanted to talk about your wage subsidy program.
You mentioned yesterday that you passed a bill to the opposition.
Does that mean a bill and parliament needs to be reconvened in order for that program to go forward?



**Answer**:

Much of the wage subsidy is going to be embedded in the income tax act, so that does require us to move forward on parliamentary legislation andthat's what we're talking about right now with parliamentarians.

**Question**:

Has the United States granted a full exemption for its import restrictions or is the situation with the company 3m a one-off?



**Answer**:

We continue to work with Americans.
As I've said, we've had constructive and productive conversations that have assured that this particular shipment comes through.
We recognize there's still more work to do. We're going to continue to highlight to the America situation the point to which healthcare supplies and services go back and forth across the border and it is in both of our interests to continue to work together with integrated supply chains that move back and forth, to make sure we continue to protect Canadian healthcare workers while they continue to do what they are doing to keep Americans safe.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that it's important to point out to the Americans that we have a fully integrated border and system.
Now, it's very good news that we're going to get those shipments from 3m, but we have to continue to work to ensure that the United States administration understands it is in both of our interests to continue to ensure a free flow of goods and equipment -- essential goods and equipment across the border in these difficult times.

**Question**:

On another matter, what is the federal government prepared to do if COVID-19 ends up spreading like wildfire in communities like fort hope in northwestern Ontario, given its housing crisis and it's been on a boil water crisis for more than 6800 days.



**Answer**:

From the very beginning we have been concerned about the potential impact of COVID-19 on rural, remote, indigenous communities that could be extremely vulnerable because of pre-existing challenges around housing and healthcare, but also vulnerabilities in the population of elders and people with respiratory challenges.
That's why from the start we've worked with the a. F.n. and with communities across the country to ensure that we're sending more money, more community resources to those areas.
We will continue to respond in every way we possibly can to help those communities that are beginning to deal with COVID-19. We recognize that there are particular vulnerabilities that we need to work very carefully with and we continue to do so.  [voice of interpreter] we recognize from the outset that indigenous communities right across the country could be more vulnerableto this epidemic because of pre-existing problems and the lack of healthcare.
So we have already done a great deal to try to secure those communities, but we also know there's much more to be done andwe will continue to work with them.

**Question**:

The banks announced they would reduce their interest rates on credit cards, but only for those who can't pay the minimum amount and for the period they can't pay it. In the meantime, the interest accumulates.
So when they come out of that period, they will have very heavy debt.
Now, I would like to know whether you think it's reasonable or not to say that the interest rates will be lower when the banks are making $45 billion in profits.



**Answer**:

Well, right from the very beginning we've been in discussion with the banks to encourage them to do more.
I have often spoken at this podium about the importance of lowering interest rates on credit cards.
We're happy that the banks have taken some initial measures, but we realize they can do more and we would like to see more.
That's why the government of Canada is working on other solutions in order to give people access to credit at low rates.
We will have more to say about that in the coming days and weeks.

**Question**:

Yes, you also did buy block mortgages.
Will you demand more of the banks in exchange for the support that you're giving them? they have the means.



**Answer**:

Well, banks in canadadepend on a healthy economy and on successful Canadians.
They know that if we're facing very, very difficult circumstances for Canadians and businesses, they also will end up suffering.
That's why we're encouraging them to do more and we continue our discussions with them, with a main focus on the banks' need to do more.
We know they have done certain things, but there's still more to be done.
Every single day we're seeing that this crisis is becoming a major challenge for everyone.

**Question**:

Yesterday Dr. Tam said one should wear a non-medical mask if physical distancing was not possible, butthere's still a lot of confusionabout when and where one should wear a mask.
Maybe you could clarify for Canadians regarding non-medical masks whether a person is pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, should they wear a non-surgical mask when they go outside, even if they think they can physical distance?



**Answer**:

I think those are the questions people should be taking the advice of medical experts from.
I am not a medical expert.
What I have heard from medical experts is that the most important thing is for people to stay home.
If they do have to go out, they need to keep 2 metres apart and look to go out as minimally as possible, wash your hands regularly, and cough into your elbows.
These are the things that we know will slow and arrest of this disease through this country.
My understanding from Dr. Tam yesterday, if people want to wear a mask, that is okay.
It protects others more than it protects you because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them -- what a terrible image -- but it actually is something that people can do in certain situations.
Our focus is making sure that people don't think that wearing masks can mean that they don't have to social distance as much or can go out more often.
The advice remains, stay home and keep 2 metres apart.

**Question**:

Also, when your government saw the spread of COVID-19 back in china and Asia back in January, did your government start procuring extra medical supplies then? because it seems that Canada was not prepared and did not secure enough P.P.E. S for our hospital workers?



**Answer**:

I think we're seeing now that the entire world was unprepared to have as much P.P.E. As needed.
Some places are facing far greater shortages than Canada.
We have worked extremely hard tostep up our procurement of P.P.E. S, but also increasing thecanadian production of personal protective equipment and materials like ventilators and testing kits.
We recognize that this is something that we're incredibly lucky that canadian companies are stepping up in the and in the coming weeks we will securedsupply of many of those productsfrom here in Canada.
In the meantime, we continue to work to bring in the equipment that is going to be necessary tokeep our healthcare workers protected and our frontline workers protected across the country.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] when the equipment will be ready, do we know if there will be enough to meet the demand because you don't seem to know that and how will that be reassuring for healthcare professionals?



**Answer**:

Well, 30, 000 ventilators is a large number and we hope it will be much more than enough to meet any worst-case scenario that may arise in the coming weeks and that we'll have enough ventilators.
But we also know that preparing in advance for the worst-case scenario is the responsible thing to do. We know that those ventilators will be ready in the coming weeks and months, and we will continue to work with them to have a clearer idea of when we can actually access them and distribute them across the country.
[end of translation] we recognize that 30, 000 ventilators is a large number ofventilators, and we certainly hope that we do not get anywherenear that number.
But we find it much better to beprepared and to create these pieces of equipment that are going to be necessary in Canada and certainly elsewhere around the world.
We foresee those ventilators, there's a number of different suppliers coming in a number of weeks, some in a matter of months, but we know that creating these is going to be extremely important to handle the future pass of this epidemic.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] huawei is going to be providing masks and respirators, but we're in a tense situation with china.
Will Canada accept those products from huawei and are you not concerned they will ask for something in return, particularly in the case of mengwanzhou?



**Answer**:

We will receive things from various companies and we're happy they are offering that.
We will use them on the condition they meet our needs and they are of the appropriate quality, considering these are for our healthcare professional sand we are accepting those donations quite openly.
But no, we do not expect this to have any impact on our -- this will not affect our decision on other issues in the years to come.
[end of translation] we are happy to be receiving donations and shipments from many companies in Canada and around the world.
We need to make sure that equipment is to Canadian standards and we will make sure it gets to the healthcare and front line workers who need it. That is our priority right now, but receiving goods from a particular company won't necessarily imply at all that we regard different situations with that company any different in the future.

**Question**:

It's Annie bergeron-oliver with CTV news.
There are a lot of people sitting at home dealing with anxiety, depression, and stress, whether because they can't figure out to pay their upcomingbills, dealing with COVID-19 on their own, or they've lost a loved one and can't have a funeral or a celebration of life.
Why has your government not donemore for those people and what specifically will you be doing?



**Answer**:

First off, we know Otis important to get help to as many people as possible.
The money we have put to the wage subsidy and the Canada emergency response benefit has gone towards alleviating the stress people are facing.
People are facing many things, whether it's kids stuck alone and not able to play with friends, or seniors worried about their own vulnerability, or Canadians who are really worried about their situation and their future and are feeling alone and really challenged.
We need to be there for each other.
That's why I said a few weeks ago, reach out if you need help.
There are support lines and measures in place to give us positive reinforcement and support, but each of us individually can also look out for our neighbours and loved ones.
Have more conversations and try to create a supportive system where we're there for each other and able to get through this together.
This is a difficult situation and particularly difficult on a number of people.
We need to make sure we're caring for each other and we have done things and need to do more to support Canadians through this difficult time.
Everyone has to do everything to keep our workers safe and minimize the impact of this disease.

**Question**:

a growing number of police officers and bylaw officers right across the country are starting to lay fines and charges to people not obeying physical distancing measures.
Do you support fining individuals who are not following social distancing measures? now with a number of people being issued these tickets, does that indicate to you many people are still not taking this pandemic seriously?



**Answer**:

We know that one of the best ways to ensure that this pandemic is as short as possible, is as unserious or as non-consequential as possible, that the fewest number of Canadians die, that our healthcare systems don't get overwhelmed, we need to stay home and engage in social distancing.
That has been the message for weeks now and it will continue to be the message for a number of weeks.
We need to make sure everyone isdoing their part.
I recognize that a lot of policeforces and municipal governmentsand provincial governments are looking at ways of ensuring people understand how serious itis.
We of course expect people to use good judgment, both on behalf of citizens trying to make sure that they're social distancing and not going out if they don't have to, but also on enforcement officers in terms ofapplying fines.
We're all in this together.
We need to get through this together ask be there for each other, but we have to make sure everyone is doing their part as well.

---

**Question**:

[ indiscernible ] --



**Answer**:

[voice of interpreter] we recognize that what is essential in this situation is that people continue to keep their distance and stay home as much as possible.
We know that's the best way of getting through this.
We see that there are police services and municipalities that are starting to apply fines and give tickets to people who are not following the public health advice.
I think it's important that people be motivated and encouraged and that they know there will be consequences if they do not follow that advice.
The most serious consequence will be more dead Canadians and more pressure on our healthcare system.
But if there are people who get those tickets, as we ask all Canadians to use their good judgment in terms of knowing what to do or not to do, we expect our police officers as well to use their good judgment when handing out fines and tickets.

**Question**:

I would like to ask you about testing for the virus.
What's holding up health Canada from approving certify -- serologic testing and what is keeping us from adopting widespread testing to get this under control?



**Answer**:

As I've said over theweeks, rapid and widespread testing is essential in controlling this virus.
Canada is doing well in terms of the number of tests we're doing, but we know we can and should be doing better.
That's why nationally every day we're testing more people than the day before, and we need to make sure that provinces across the country are doing the tests that are necessary.
The serologic tests are being looked at carefully to see who has the antibodies.
But we're in the early days of reflecting on the societal and medical implications of those tests.
We're looking to pursue every avenue getting us through this, keeping the numbers of canadiansseverely infected to the lowest level and of course to bringing our economy back strongly as soon as possible so we can keep doing the things that we love todo as Canadians.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that it is essential to carry out more testing as a strategy, not just for now but over the long term, to ensure that we have COVID-19 under control.
That is why every single day at the national level we are testing more and more people and we will continue to increase those numbers.
We are working with the various jurisdictions to make sure everyone can do more because that is a critical piece of the fight against COVID-19. There are a number of strategies being looked at, including serological testing.
We're looking at all possible avenues to arrive at a solution for our country, so that we can get better, be healthy as individuals and communities in the coming days.

**Question**:

Your government asked correctional officials to consider early release for some inmates because of COVID-19. I'm wondering what's happened.
Correctional services says theyeer studying this, but there are some outbreaks.
What is taking so long to act?



**Answer**:

We're taking measures to ensure we're keeping inmates and corrections officers more safe from COVID-19, but we're still looking at other steps.
I'm sure Minister Blair will be able to have further updates on that in the coming days.
