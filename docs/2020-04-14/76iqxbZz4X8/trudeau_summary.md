### Summary:



Over the weekend, we received new shipments of essential personal protective equipment, including four planes worth of n95 masks.
These new n95 masks masks are in addition to the 820, 000 that went to provinces last week.
All told, this means we have 1.1million n95 masks ready to be shipped to the provinces and territories with more to come.
We have also received millions of pairs of gloves and we'll be getting new protective gowns delivered from domestic suppliers starting next Monday.
 

[voice of interpreter] during the weekend, we received four planes' worth of essential goods, including n95 masks.
These new n95 masks can be added to the 820, 000 masks that we received last week.
All together, we are prepared to send 1.1 million n95 masks to the provinces and territories in the coming days.
With respect to tests, we are making important progress.
I'm thinking of spartan bio science that is based in Ottawa, which will be supplying thousands of new test kits everymonth.
As Dr. Tam said yesterday, more than 430, 000 tests have been carried out in Canada.
We will continue to increase our testing capacity and look at new technologies in order to simplify those tests right across the country.


[end of translation] in the last two days we've also made progress on testing.
Right now, we're moving forward on a range of rapid testing kits, both from here in Canada and internationally. Our experts and health professionals are working hard to increase our capacity to keepramping up tests across the country.
Demand for these supplies is going up and we're going to makesure Canada can keep up.  

[voice of interpreter] COVID-19 has transformed the daily lives of all Canadians, but it's clear that those who are in the arcticregions are not facing the same issues as people who live in cities.
Today I am announcing that the government will invest almost $130 million to help northern communities fight COVID-19. Of that money, $72.6 million will be given to the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut to boost their healthcare system and help it tofight COVID-19. We are also providing funds to nutrition in the north so that food remains affordable which will help families to remain healthy.
We are offering support to business owners whose expenses are not already covered through other measures that we've already put in place.


[end of translation] I can announce that we are investing almost $130 million to support northern communities in dealing with COVID-19. If you live in the north, chances are you're worried aboutwhether your local health centrehas the resources to fight COVID-19 and to cope with cases that might come up. So we're providing $72.6 millionto the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut specifically for healthcare and community preparedness.
We're going to help you through them to set your community up tocome back strong when things getbetter because they will.
If you own a business and your costs aren't already covered by other measures we've put in place, we're giving cannor more funding to help.
Now, as many people as we've already helped -- and we're talking about millions of Canadians -- we know there is more to do.
At the same time, we're working to enhance the Canada emergency business account, as well as newsupports on commercial rent for businesses that are hardest hit.
We are also announcing $20 million for the canadian food inspection agency to strengthen food inspections and keep our food supply safe.
 

[voice of interpreter] we are going through difficult times, but right across the country I know that many people are concerned, not only about their future or their health, but those of theirparents and grandparents.
At the same time, we continue towork with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have everything they need to keep people healthy.
