**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Over the weekend, we received new shipments of essential personal protective equipment, including four planes worth of n95 masks.
As we speak, workers are unpacking and validating these supplies so we can start shipping them to the provinces and territories as quickly as possible.
These new n95 masks masks are in addition to the 820, 000 that went to provinces last week.
All told, this means we have 1.1million n95 masks ready to be shipped to the provinces and territories with more to come.
We have also received millions of pairs of gloves and we'll be getting new protective gowns delivered from domestic suppliers starting next Monday.
 

[voice of interpreter] during the weekend, we received four planes' worth of essential goods, including n95 masks.
We also have an order for qu√âbec.
These new n95 masks can be added to the 820, 000 masks that we received last week.
All together, we are prepared to send 1.1 million n95 masks to the provinces and territories in the coming days.
We also received millions of pairs of gloves and we will be distributing those to hospitals starting on Monday.
With respect to tests, we are making important progress.
I'm thinking of spartan bio science that is based in Ottawa, which will be supplying thousands of new test kits everymonth.
As Dr. Tam said yesterday, more than 430, 000 tests have been carried out in Canada.
We will continue to increase our testing capacity and look at new technologies in order to simplify those tests right across the country.


[end of translation] in the last two days we've also made progress on testing.
Right now, we're moving forward on a range of rapid testing kits, both from here in Canada and internationally.
This includes ottawa-based spartan bioscience who will be supplying tens of thousands of kits and potentially more as production increases.
As Dr. Tam said yesterday, more than 340, 000 Canadians have beentested for COVID-19. Our experts and health professionals are working hard to increase our capacity to keepramping up tests across the country.
Demand for these supplies is going up and we're going to makesure Canada can keep up.  

[voice of interpreter] COVID-19 has transformed the daily lives of all Canadians, but it's clear that those who are in the arcticregions are not facing the same issues as people who live in cities.
For example, I know that there are a number of people who are concerned to see empty grocery shelves.
Others are worried whether theirhealthcare centre has enough space and resources to combat the virus if it spreads into their community.
I can assure you we are doing everything we can to avoid that happening.
Today I am announcing that the government will invest almost $130 million to help northern communities fight COVID-19. Of that money, $72.6 million will be given to the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut to boost their healthcare system and help it tofight COVID-19. We are also providing funds to nutrition in the north so that food remains affordable which will help families to remain healthy.
So that medical equipment and food can get to those regions, we're working with airline companies to make sure that thatcan happen.
Finally, I know that a number ofbusinesses in the north are particularly affected by this crisis.
We are offering support to business owners whose expenses are not already covered through other measures that we've already put in place.


[end of translation] I can announce that we are investing almost $130 million to support northern communities in dealing with COVID-19. If you live in the north, chances are you're worried aboutwhether your local health centrehas the resources to fight COVID-19 and to cope with cases that might come up. So we're providing $72.6 millionto the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut specifically for healthcare and community preparedness.
We're also investing more money to nutrition north Canada.
This will make it easier to afford the food and basics that keep you and your family healthy.
To ensure that things like groceries and medical equipment can continue to get to you, we're providing funding for northern air carriers to transport these supplies.
These are tough times.
We're going to help you through them to set your community up tocome back strong when things getbetter because they will.
We have to think about small businesses too.
I know entrepreneurs in the north have been hit especially hard by this crisis.
If you own a business and your costs aren't already covered by other measures we've put in place, we're giving cannor more funding to help.
No matter where you live, in a small community or a big city, we're here for you.
This weekend we brought parliament back to pass the largest economic policy since the second world war.
With the canadian emergency wagesubsidy, we will protect jobs byhelping businesses keep their employees on the payroll.
We'll be rolling this measure out as quickly as possible.
Now, as many people as we've already helped -- and we're talking about millions of Canadians -- we know there is more to do. You might not currently qualify for the Canada emergency response benefit, but you still might need a hand.
If you are a student or an essential worker, for example, this week we'll be talking abouthow to reach you, while also supporting sectors that have been especially hard hit.
At the same time, we're working to enhance the Canada emergency business account, as well as newsupports on commercial rent for businesses that are hardest hit.
I'll have more to say about all of this soon.
If you've come back to Canada from abroad, as of today we are strengthening measures.
Now, if asymptomatic travellers cannot explain a credible quarantine plan, they will be required to quarantine in a hotel.
This will come into effect at midnight tonight.
We are also announcing $20 million for the canadian food inspection agency to strengthen food inspections and keep our food supply safe.
This will mean we can build capacity for more overtime and extra shifts for inspectors to fill demand.
It also means we can invest in things like hiring and training to get more people on board.
 

[voice of interpreter] we are going through difficult times, but right across the country I know that many people are concerned, not only about their future or their health, but those of theirparents and grandparents.
Seniors are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, which means that we mustn't visit themin seniors' homes or long-term care facilities.
To help to protect them, we haveintroduced new guidelines for this type of facility.
We have set clear rules with respect to restrictions on visits and controls on personneland what to do in cases of infection.
At the same time, we continue towork with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have everything they need to keep people healthy.


[end of translation] I want to take a moment to speak directly to everyone who's lost a loved one.
If you're grieving, know that you're not alone.
We are here for you, even through this incredibly tough time.
You remind us why it's so important to do everything we can to keep one another safe.
We all need to do our part.
We can't let up now.
So to everyone, stay at home.
No matter what, stay 2 metres apart if you do have to go out.
When it gets hard, let's remember that we're all in this together.
 

[voice of interpreter] I'm now ready to take your questions.
