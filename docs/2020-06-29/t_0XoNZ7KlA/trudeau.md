# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Our government has been working on making sure people are safe and supported during this challenging time.
As we move into the summer, this work continues.
While we made good progress over the last few months, the virus remains a serious throat our house.
With parts of the economy shut down for many months, a lot of people need help getting back on their feet.
So, we're going to continue helping in every way we can.
Our government has launched new programmes and made new investments to help businesses re-open safely, get people back on the job and lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back.
If you own a business and struggling with cash flow, you can get a loan through the Canada emergency business account to bridge to better times.
If you are a student or recent grad looking for a job, we've created thousands of new workplacements through Canada's summer jobs and student workplacement programme.
If you are an employer and need help to bring back your staff, the Canada emergency wage subsidy is there for you through the summer.
In every part of the country, business owners are stepping up and hiring back their staff from brook signs in Ontario to anchor outfitting in turner valley, Alberta.
and moving forward, our government will help even more businesses bring back their workers.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Life is slowly starting to return to normal and this is good news for everyone.
The recovery also presents new challenge.
Our government continues to follow the situation closely and to listen to Canadians.
We want the programmes to be adapted to people's needs and realities and that is why the federal government intends to extend by one month the emergency commercial rent assistance programme and we're working with the provinces and territories to make that happen.
This programmes allows small businesses across the country to pay less for their rent.
We understand that many owners have problems with cash flow right now and we're working on that this week.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The federal government plans to extend the rent assistance programme by another month and working with the provinces and territories to do just that.
This programme is helping thousands of small businesses across the country save on rent.
We know that many business owners are struggling with cash flow right now so we're working on a solution.
With summer officially here, I know a lot of people are wondering what to expect for the coming months.
So, this afternoon, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo will release the latest public health modeling.
We'll have more details then, but here is the main takeaway from these projections.
After a very challenging spring, things are continuing to move in the right direction.
We still have some hot spots in some parts of the country, but nationally the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths is declining over time and that is because Canadians are doing their part.
You took this seriously.
You followed public health instructions and made sacrifices so we could get this virus under control.
Over the coming weeks, we'll keep Canadian updated including the latest numbers continuing to be published every single day.
As we move into this new phase, Dr. Tam, Dr. Njoo and I will provide an update on the pandemic a few times every week, instead of every day, when we have briefings or information to share.
I want to stress, though, that while we're on the right track, the fight against COVID-19 is not over yet.
As we start to re-open the economy, we must continue to follow local public health guidelines to keep each other safe.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

This afternoon, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo will be presenting the latest projections from public health.
There will be further details provided at that time, but this is the major takeaway.
After a difficult spring, things continue to improve.
We have hot spots in Canada, but across the country, the number of cases of hospitalizations and deaths is declining.
and that is because Canadians are doing their part.
You took the situation seriously by following public health advice and making sacrifices.
In the coming week, we'll continue to update you on the latest developments as we have been doing from the outset.
The latest data on COVID-19 will continue to be published every day.
Given that we're now entering a new phase, Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo and myself will be holding updates only a few times a week, but not every day.
I want to be very clear, however, we have made significant progress, but we're not out of the woods yet.
We have to remain prudent and continue to follow public health and experts' advice.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

With Canada day around the corner, we have another busy week ahead of us. In addition to our ongoing response to COVID-19, the new NAFTA will come into force on wed.
With trade between NAFTA members valued at nearly $1.5 trillion in 2018, we can't overstate how vital it is to maintain free and fair trade between our three countries.
Millions of jobs depend on a strong and stable relationship with our partners.
This deal secures access to the north American market for our business owners, entrepreneurs and consumers.
It removes uncertainty for our manufacturers, our investors and our workers.
This deal is good for Canada and good for Canadians.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Now we will take questions.
