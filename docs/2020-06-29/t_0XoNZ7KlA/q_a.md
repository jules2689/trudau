Thank you, Merci.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
First of all, I'd like you to comment on the criticisms made by the quoeb labour Minister of the CERB.
Apparently the extension has not helped to relaunch the economy.
What do you think of his analysis? he is saying that that is hindering the re-opening of the economy rather than boosting it. Well, there are thousands, in fact millions of Canadians out there who don't have a job and want job.
and because the economy has slowed down and was at a complete standstill for several months, there are no jobs there for them.
So, we have to continue to provide them the necessary help so that they can support their family and buy their groceries.
That is our priority.
Yes, the economic recovery is important and we have seen many, many companies, many businesses using the wage subsidy in order to assist that recovery.
But we are still in a situation where too many Canadians still need the CERB and, therefore, we decided to extend it. Follow-up? yes.
I'd also like you to comment on what is happening south of the border in some United States states where we're really seeing a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases.
Today are you able to re-assure Canadians by telling them that the restrictions at the border will remain in place past July 21? well, first of all, the restrictions at the border will continue to be in place and we will also continue in the coming weeks and the coming months, talk about the next steps.
But right now those restrictions remain in place until July 21. In terms of what's happening in the United States, I think we have to learn from the challenges other countries are facing.
So, yes, even though we're slowly re-opening the economy, we must continue to take the right steps wearing a mask when we can't keep a two-metre distance from others, being careful about contact with other individuals if we don't want to lose all the progress that we have made in the recent months.
We will simply have to continue to be vigilant even as that new phase begins.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Obviously we'll don't put the safety of Canadians at the top of our priority list which is why we have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August.
What the situation we're seeing in the United States and elsewhere highlights for us is that even as our economy is re-opening, we need to make sure that we're continuing to remain vigilant, individually and collectively.
That means continuing to wear masks when we can't keep two metres apart, continuing to be careful about coming sbhao contact with people.
Continuing to practice what the public health officers are recommending in your regions.
We need to continue to be careful, even as we re-open so that we don't lose all the significant progress we've made through some very difficult sacrifices by Canadians over the past months.



Thank you.

**Reporter**:

Hello, Prime Minister.
I'm wondering about how your government has rolled out some of these COVID-19 programmes.
There's been some criticism about how the response was handled and I'm wondering if you could get a redo on this response, what would you have done differently?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there is certainly plenty of things.
Some things we may have done a little sooner and some thing we may have done a little later.
But we spent very little time analyzing, wishing we'd done things differently.
Those reflections are ongoing and will continue to be ongoing so we're better positioned for a potential second-wave and moving forward.
But throughout, we've done our very best every step of the way to make sure Canadians are supported.
On that measure, we were successful.
In terms of the support through the CERB, for -- over eight million Canadians who needed it, we were able to support families who were then able to lock down and able to get to the place in an extremely nraeened em -- epidemiological curve.
But in general when we compare to other countries and look at what the oecd said about Canada having had a rapid and substantive response, we know that we've done pretty well.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Of course, in the coming months, we'll have a lot to think about whether we could have done certain things differently or sooner.
But the fact is we did the right thing at the right time overall in order to hate Canadians to stay home and continue to pay their groceries and keep our economy sufficiently in tact to be able to re-open it now.
Businesses got support.
That support for businesses and families has work and we'll learn from what we did in order to better respond in the fall if there is a second wave.



**Reporter**:

and you mentioned possibly the second wave.
I'm wondering what is the government's capacity to respond, given that the economy has already been shut down for several months and that spending has been increasing due to the COVID-19 response programmes.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We went into this pandemic with one of the best balance sheets in the g-7. We were, therefore, able to give the people support necessary as we get through.
As always, we will prepare ourselves for the worst-possible scenario, but we will hopefully see the best possible scenarios.
We know we'll be working very, very hard to continue the testing, the contact tracing including across all all provinces.
We'll be rolling out an app that will be an extra layer of support for Canadians to keep them safe.
On top of that, we also know that if we do get hit in certain regions or across the country in the fall, we'll be able to respond to within sufficient fiscal room to be able to do that.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

We know that we always have to prepare for the worst.
But hope for the best.
If there is a second wave that could hit us hard, I think then that our investments in more tasting and -- testing and contract tracing will allow us to respond quickly if there is an outbreak in the coming weeks and months.
I think that is the right approach to take under the circumstances.
At the same time, we've had one of the best balance sheets of any of the g-7 countries at the time we entered this pandemic and that is why we were able to help so many businesses and families get through these recent months.
If ever we find ourselves in difficult circumstances in the fall, we'll have the capacity to continue to provide help.
But as I said, we want to ensure that what we have in terms of current measures or measures in place will, if possible, prevent a second wave.

Next question, the "globe and mail". line open.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Thank you for taking our questions.
This question is about Canadian foreign fighters in Syria.
Despite your government's claim that it is too dangerous to send diplomats into northeastern Syria to repatriate these Canadians, more than 20 countries including the United States, France and Germany, have repatriated their citizens from northeast Syria.
Why can't Canada do the same and take responsibility for its citizens?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We continue to engage in consular cases around the globe.
The situation in Syria continues to be extremely dangerous.
There are countries that have presence on the ground in Syria.
Canada is not one of those countries.
We'll continue to ensure that we're keeping as a priority the protection of Canadians working abroad, particularly in this COVID-19 context.
But in every context.
Ok. 



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

We'll continue to work to help Canadians in difficulty right around the world.
? in syria, there are many, many countries that are on the ground.
Canada is not one of those.
It is not on the ground in syria.
But we will continue to try and help canadian while at the same time, recognizing that the health and security of the members of our diplomatic corps must be our top priority, particularly in the middle of a pandemic.
But at all times.



**Reporter**:

As a follow-up, liberian warlord bill horath who has been accused of committing rape and other crimes has been living in the United Kingdom without facing charges.
Why did Canada fail to bring him to justice?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

This is a question on which we will be following up as a government.



Merci.

**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to quickly come back to what was mentioned earlier and Quebec's position.
There have been some criticisms of your programmes.
and they are saying that the CERB is not assisting certain sectors of the economy.
is this something you wish to reflect on possibly? the CERB was extended because there is still millions of Canadians who want to work.
But for whom there are simply no jobs available.
Yes, we have been here to support entrepreneurs and businesses, but our priority must always be Canadian families and workers and that is the choice that we made.
We are encouraging the businesses that can to use the wage subsidy in order to bring back their workers.
We are encouraging the economy to re-open gradually and as quickly as possible.
But at the same time, we will always give our top priority to people in this pandemic and that is exactly what we've been doing.
Follow-up?



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Yes, thank you.
Now on the question of a vaccine, we're still far from having one.
But if a vaccine were to be developed, and there was one, what is the power of the federal government when it comes to imposing of a vaccine since very high levels of vaccination will be needed to beat COVID-19? well, I think we're very far away from that scenario.
I said that when and as soon as a vaccine is available, people will not be forced to be vaccinated.
First of all, there must be enough vaccine for everyone and that is what we're working on now.
We actually have partnerships with many companies here in Canada and around the world to make sure that we can make a strong contribution to developing that vaccine and then afterwards produce enough of it in order to help all Canadians as well as vulnerable countries around the world.
That is our priority and I AM confident that Canadians, as always, and as they have throughout this pandemic will do the right thing when it comes to a vaccine.
Radio-Canada.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
We're entering a new phase, new projections, the possibility of a second wave.
What is the importance of wearing a mask in this context? now will you wear one? it has been strongly recommended but there is still people who don't wear a mask in public.
Does that concern you? I think everyone will have to make their own decision.
But I do believe that there are many Canadians who have been following public health and experts' advice.
That's what I've been doing.
I wear a mask when I go to the office or close to people, when I believe I cannot keep a two-metre distance from others.
This is a personal discipline that I have been practicing and I'm sure many other people are doing it as well.
Now if we really want to prevent that second wave from happening, as we relax the restrictions that have been affecting the general population, individual measures will be very important.
Keeping one's distance, washing one's hands, not touching your face, wearing a mask when you can't keep a two-metre distance from others.
That is how we can ensure that there won't be a second wave or that the second wave, if it happens, will be minimized.
We have to remain vigilant until we develop a vaccine and it's accessible to everyone.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Obviously I think it is important that people don't follow public health advice.
Even as we are loosening population controls, loosening rules around businesses and leaving home, it's going to be really important that individuals continue to behave carefully and in responsible ways.
Our local public health officials are encouraging continuing to keep two metre's distance.
When you can't do that, to wear a mask.
Certainly that's the choice that I'm making in order to keep myself and others safe.
It is going to be really, really important that everyone remains attentive and vigilant to their own behaviours so that we can prevent a second wave from arriving as we've seen in many places -- beginning to see in places around the world.
But also so we can minimize any wave if it does hit.
It's on Canadians individually and that is why I have tremendous confidence because we've seen how Canadians have acted and reacted over these past months, which has allowed us to get to this next phase.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

With respect to NAFTA coming into effect in two days, the dairy industry made sacrifices, the aluminum country made sacrifices.
We made concessions to the United States in other words to sew lid fie -- solidify our access to the United States market and the agreement is not even in effect yet and there is already talk of tariffs on aluminum and other goods.
Well, with the new NAFTA, we were able to protect our cultural industries in the digital era and for the future.
We were able to ensure better protection for our auto industry.
and the most important thing is that we were able to continue to protect our privileged access for thousands of Canadian businesses to the United States market at a time of protectionism and uncertainty around the world.
So, we were able to protect our access to the market and that is extremely important.
Now it's true that we have been hearing some concerning proposals about tariff on aluminum and we'll don't point out to the United States that they need Canadian aluminum for their industries, including the auto industry and for technology industries across the United States and increasing the price of aluminum for their workers and companies is a bad idea.
Once again, we see that our economies are closely integrated and will continue to point that out to the United States administration.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Moving forward on a renewed NAFTA, that achieved many important gains for Canadians, protections on intellectual property and protections for our auto industry, protections on cultural industries, which was extremely important right across the country, not just in Quebec.
But most important of all, we secured Canada's access to the world's largest market in a privileged way at a time of protection and uncertainty.
and that is something that makes a huge difference for Canadians, for Canadian businesses and, indeed, investors around the world that Canada continues to have protected and privileged access to the United States.
In regards to aluminum, we will -- we have heard obviously the musings and proposals from the United States that perhaps there needs to be more tariffs on aluminums.
What we simply highlight is the United States needs Canadian aluminum.
They do not produce enough, nowhere near enough aluminum in the states to be able to fill their domestic manufacturing needs.
Therefore, if they put taifrs on Canadian aluminum, they're simply increasing the costs of inputs, necessary inputs to their manufacturing base, which will hurry the American economy.
We will continue to advocate for continued, free and fair trade between our two countries in a relationship that has been extraordinarily beneficial to our two countries for many, many decades.



**Reporter**:

Brian Mullen, global news.
Tole to up on an earlier question, human rights watch says Canada may be unlawfully with holding or limiting effective consular assistance to the 47 Canadians, including 26 children, detained in northern Syria.
What is your response to this specific allegation? is your government deliberately with holding assistance?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The primary preoccupation of any government needs to be the safety and security of its citizens.
In this situation, the safety and security of our diplomatic personnel needs to be top of mind.
Particularly at a time of COVID-19, but in regular times as well.
We will continue to work through third parties to try and provide consular assistance to Canadians but Canada, unlike many other European and international partners does not have any Canadian personnel in Syria.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Canada does not have any international work with our partners.
The protection of our Canadian workers is always our top priority.



**Reporter**:

is the government deliberately with holding assistance?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We continue to be a government that looks to support Canadians in difficulty overseas.
Something we've done consistently and will continue to do.



**Reporter**:

I just want to follow-up on this human rights watch report.
They say this action leading canadian nationals being subject to torture and inhumane conditions and it's a serious allegation from this organization.
How does it affect your ability.
You've often stood up here and said you're never fried bring those issues directly to other countries accused of this.
How does this report now affect your ability and credibility to do that?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As a country, we have always stood up to condemn those action and we'll consistently stand up and defend Canadians and citizens rights to live in safety and in peace.
We have a responsibility as a government to ensure that Canadian citizens, particularly employees, are not put into danger, are not exposed to grave situations.
Syria is an area where we do ?rot any diplomats or any Canadians on the ground.
and, therefore, we work through intermediaries to try to provide consular assistance as best we can.
Ok. 



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

We will continue to condemn violence in the middle east.
We know it destabilizes not only people living in the region, but it affects people around the world.
But we must ensure the safety of Canadians and that is why we're working with other partners to help Canadians in difficulty.



**Reporter**:

[inaudible] outsourced the student grant programme.
The conservatives have asked for the auditor general to look into it. I think I want to ask you, how will there be accountability for parliament with this, you know, $900 million programme being outsourced to a third party?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The government of Canada has extensive practice of working with third parties, charities to deliver programmes when we wand ed to move forward to help various food banks across the country.
We worked with the charity, food banks Canada, in order to deliver the programme.
When we wanted to help grassroots community organisations, we worked with United Way in order deliver that programme.
The we charities are evaluated by our public service as being the best and only organization able to deliver on the scale that we need to make sure that young people have service opportunities this summer.
We saw 25, 000 young people from every corner of the country apply just over the past few days to be able to serve their country.
and we know that this is something that is going to be extremely important in the coming months.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

The government of Canada regularly works with charities to deliver programmes on food security.
In one case, we delivered the programme with food banks Canada.
We will continue to work rigorously with certain organisations to provide more help for Canadians and the we organization is in a very good position to deliver this programme right across the country.
and, in fact, in the last two or three days, we've seen some 25, 000 young Canadians apply for the programme so that they can serve their community.
So it's clear that young people want to get involved, want to volunteer and serve their communities and their country.
and we have to encourage them.



**Reporter**:

Tom parry, CBC.
On the human rights watch report, I'd like to ask you, is your government in any way reluctant to help these particular Canadians, given their connection to ISIS?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we recognize that we need to try to help all Canadians.
It is more complicated when we talk about the fact that a number of these people could face charges when they return to Canada for their activities linked to terrorism.
But the engagement that we need to have with people around the world in order to make sure that they're getting the support that they have a right to as Canadians continues to be something we worry about.
Ok. 



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Of course, in some of these cases, individuals were charged or faced accusations when they returned to Canada for supporting terrorist activities.
But at the same time, we have an obligation to help Canadians, whatever their situation.
and that is always something we will seek to do.



**Reporter**:

Can you explain why they are the only ones that can do this job.
What skills do they have that no one else does and some volunteer organisations say that you're blurring the line between paid labour and volunteer work.
What do you think about that?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The we organization is the largest national youth service organization in the country.
They have networks in every corner of the country, and organizations that they work with.
They already have worked over the past many years to deliver service opportunities in every corner of the country and, quite frankly, when our public servants looked at the potential partners, only the we organization had the capacity to deliver the ambitious programme that young people need for this summer that is so deeply impacted by COVID-19. An the issue of service and volunteerism, we know that thousands upon thousands of young people want to step up and engage in their communities, serve in their communities, help their country and their fellow citizens through this difficulty while at the same time, developing important work experience.
The idea of giving bonus grants to young people who serve has long existed and we know that it is something that is really important to recognize the value of service, but these young people will be volunteering in ways that will make a huge difference across the country.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

When they looked at various charities across the country that could help us in every corner of the country on a scale that would affect thousands of Canadians, only the we organization turned out to be capable of doing that.
They have the connections and the network and the experience for having already delivered similar programmes right across the country.
and, therefore, we'll be profiting from their experience in this case through this programme that will help thousands of Canadians to serve their communities.
and the idea of giving some recognition and support to these Canadian youth is something that's well known in the volunteer context and we, as a country, will be able to recognize the importance and value of that volunteer work.
It's important to realise that young Canadians have so much to offer their communities for our future and right now and that is why we'll always be there for them.
