### Summary:


Time and time again Canadians step up in periods of crisis to help each other and to help our friends.
[ voice of interpreter ]these days, everyone working in the food industry is working harder than ever to fill the shelves of our grocery stores.
They continue to work long hoursto feed us, and the pandemic is making things more complicated for them.
Workers must take additional measures to protect themselves.
They must change the way they work and respect physical distancing.
From the outset, we have said wewould be there for people who need a hand, so today we have announcing a new investment of more than $252 million to help the agri-food industry and help it get through this crisis.
Of that amount, we will be allocating more than $77 million to food processors in order to protect the safety of their workers.
[ end of interpretation ].
This is money that they can use to purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to health protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
[ voice of interpreter ]to help pork and beef producers, we are putting in place agri recovery, a national program with an envelope of $125 millionto help farmers adapt to market changes.
Farms and pork producing businesses are producing things like beef and bacon for us, and we have to ensure that those animals can remain on the farm longer than usual, and that is costly.
The money we're announcing todaywill help pork and beef producers to adapt to this crisis.
[ end of interpretation ]. to help cattle and hog producers, we will launch a $125million national agri recovery initiative. For many farmers, this crisis means that they have to keep animals for longer periods of time, and that can be expensive.
So with this funding, we're giving extra help to beef and pork producers so that they can adapt to this crisis.
[ voice of interpreter ]with respect to dairy farmers, we intend to work with all the parties in the house to increaseby $200 million the credit line of the canadian dairy commission.
[ end of interpretation ]. -- closed, too much of certain types of food like milk, butter and potatoes is being produced.
It's a waste of food and a loss of revenue for the people who worked so hard to produce it.
This will help ensure that our farmers are being compensated for their hard work and that ourmost vulnerable have access to fresh food during this crisis.
[ voice of interpreter ]and in fact, I'd like to take a moment to thank Minister bibeau for her work on this file.
[ end of interpretation ].
Having enough workers for harvesting later in the season, having enough personal protective equipment for workers.
These are valid concerns, and I can assure you that we are working with farmers, stakeholders and provinces and territories to find lasting solutions.
I want to close today by thanking every person who works in our food industry.
[ voice of interpreter ]to all of you working in the food industry, thank you for everything you're doing for us.
We know that there will certainly need to be more done as the needs increase, and this is money that we are sending out immediately to help our farmers and agricultural producers, and we will continue to work with them to address other needs.
[ end of interpretation ]. modelling has always been there, not as a crystal ball to tell uswhat was going to happen but to tell us the range of things thatmight happen, depending on our behaviours, depending on measures brought in. That's why we've been constantlyupdating it, constantly moving forward with new measures to make sure we're doing everythingwe can to make Canadians safe, and we will continue to do just that. We will be working with the parties in order to strengthen arms control, and it's unfortunate that the conservatives are against that in this country.
So other measures are required, and I'm pleased to hear the member speak about other measures, because together we will have to work together in the house to strengthen arms control, and I hope that the conservatives will be a positive part of that discussion to keep Canadians safe.
We continue to expect all answers to all our questions be answered, and at the same time we will be working to make sure that Canadians have all the protective equipment they need to get through this pandemic.
