# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Hello, everyone.
Before we get started I want to note that today marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands.
On this day we remember the Canadians and Newfoundlander who liberating the Netherlands from the tyranny of the Nazis.
We also pay tribute to the deep bonds that were forged between Canada and the Netherlands.
We honour the incredible courage and sacrifice of our veterans in whom we are forever in their debt.
Time and time again Canadians step up in periods of crisis to help each other and to help our friends.
We saw it 75 years ago on the battlefields of the second worldwar, and we're seeing it once again during this pandemic.
[ voice of interpreter ]these days, everyone working in the food industry is working harder than ever to fill the shelves of our grocery stores.
They continue to work long hoursto feed us, and the pandemic is making things more complicated for them.
Workers must take additional measures to protect themselves.
They must change the way they work and respect physical distancing.
and since hotels and restaurantsare closed, many producers are now dealing with significant surpluses of certain goods.
From the outset, we have said wewould be there for people who need a hand, so today we have announcing a new investment of more than $252 million to help the agri-food industry and help it get through this crisis.
Of that amount, we will be allocating more than $77 million to food processors in order to protect the safety of their workers.
This is money that they will be able to use to buy more personal protective equipment or adjust their hygiene protocols, or other measures such as physical distancing.
It will also allow processors to adapt their plants so that they can produce more goods in Canada.
[ end of interpretation ]. today we are announcing more than $77 million to support foodprocessors during this crisis.
This is money that they can use to purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to health protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
It will also help expand or adapt our processing capacity toincrease the amount of canadian products we make domestically.
[ voice of interpreter ]to help pork and beef producers, we are putting in place agri recovery, a national program with an envelope of $125 millionto help farmers adapt to market changes.
Farms and pork producing businesses are producing things like beef and bacon for us, and we have to ensure that those animals can remain on the farm longer than usual, and that is costly.
The money we're announcing todaywill help pork and beef producers to adapt to this crisis.
This is an initial investment, and if we have to do more, we will do more.
[ end of interpretation ]. to help cattle and hog producers, we will launch a $125million national agri recovery initiative.
Farms and processing plants are raising more animals than the system can process into things like steak and bacon because of COVID-19. For many farmers, this crisis means that they have to keep animals for longer periods of time, and that can be expensive.
So with this funding, we're giving extra help to beef and pork producers so that they can adapt to this crisis.
This is an initial investment, and if we need to add more, we will.
[ voice of interpreter ]with respect to dairy farmers, we intend to work with all the parties in the house to increaseby $200 million the credit line of the canadian dairy commission.
The commission already has a program in place to store dairy products.
It stores butter and cheese and has been since the beginning of this crisis, and hopes and expects to reach its maximum capacity soon.
By increasing its credit line, we will not waste fresh productsand dairy producers will be moreable to deal with the consequences of this crisis.
[ end of interpretation ]. -- closed, too much of certain types of food like milk, butter and potatoes is being produced.
While some donations have been made to food banks, we don't have the capacity right now to redistribute such large quantities of food.
and some producers have no choice but to throw out their product.
It's a waste of food and a loss of revenue for the people who worked so hard to produce it. To avoid this, we're launching asurplus food purchase program starting with a $50 million fund.
The government will buy large quantities of certain products at risk of going waste, like, say, potatoes or poultry, and redistribute them to organizations addressing food insecurity.
This will help ensure that our farmers are being compensated for their hard work and that ourmost vulnerable have access to fresh food during this crisis.
Taken together, these measures represent the $252 million investment to support the peoplewho keep our grocery stores stocked and our families fed.
[ voice of interpreter ]and in fact, I'd like to take a moment to thank Minister bibeau for her work on this file.
[ end of interpretation ]. we know that farmers still have concerns about what this pandemic means for their industry long term.
Having enough workers for harvesting later in the season, having enough personal protective equipment for workers.
These are valid concerns, and I can assure you that we are working with farmers, stakeholders and provinces and territories to find lasting solutions.
I want to close today by thanking every person who works in our food industry.
People are spending a lot more time in the kitchen cooking for an elderly neighbour, cooking for themselves, discovering new recipes, trying to make sourdough.
These days especially cooking and baking is about more than nourishment.
It's also about relieving stress, finding a community, supporting each other, creating memories.
You help make that possible, so we're here for all of you in theagri-food industry, and we will continue to be here for you.
[ voice of interpreter ]to all of you working in the food industry, thank you for everything you're doing for us. We are there for you, and we will continue to be there for you.
Thank you very much.



[ no interpretation ].



**Reporter**:

[ voice of interpreter ]. good morning, Mr. Trudeau, todayyou are thanking all the farmersand food producers, but the canadian federation of agriculture was asking you for $2.6 billion in assistance because the crisis is really hitting them hard.
You're nowhere near that amount.
What do you say to them?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, this is an initial investment.
We know that there will certainly need to be more done as the needs increase, and this is money that we are sending out immediately to help our farmers and agricultural producers, and we will continue to work with them to address other needs.



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

I'd like you to comment on the short-term projections of health Canada.
Once again the number of deaths is higher than what health Canada had expected for now.
Why is Canada too optimistic about its results?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The modelling we have established is there to guide our decisions and help us to prepare for any eventuality.
This has never been a prediction of what would happen but rather a general idea of what could happen, and therefore we have been able to adjust as things went on. We saw an adjustment in the curve, but as you say, there is still reason for concern and we will continue to adjust our projections and respond as the reality changes.
[ end of interpretation ]. modelling has always been there, not as a crystal ball to tell uswhat was going to happen but to tell us the range of things thatmight happen, depending on our behaviours, depending on measures brought in. That's why we've been constantlyupdating it, constantly moving forward with new measures to make sure we're doing everythingwe can to make Canadians safe, and we will continue to do just that.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Canadians have been affected by what happened in Nova Scotia.
Many families have experienced atragedy, and we promised that we would ban assault-style weapons.
That is what we are going to do. We will be working with the parties in order to strengthen arms control, and it's unfortunate that the conservatives are against that in this country.



Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On the contrary, now I understand what the Prime Minister is saying.
However, I'd like to know if he thinks gangs and organized crime are just going to simply hand in their weapons?



The Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, in fact this is an important step, but it's a first step.
There are other things that have to be done in order to restrict guns in our municipalities and in order to strengthen border control as well.
So other measures are required, and I'm pleased to hear the member speak about other measures, because together we will have to work together in the house to strengthen arms control, and I hope that the conservatives will be a positive part of that discussion to keep Canadians safe.



Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to say that the conservative party has always cared about protecting canadiansagainst criminals, not against their own citizens.
Now speaking of criminals, before the pandemic, the Prime Minister wanted correctional services to be able to release more easily more prisoners.
Given the pandemic, some things are moving very quickly, but the minister of public safety said that the correctional services were only releasing people who were approaching the end of their sentence.
However, we've heard that dangerous prisoners were released.
Can the Prime Minister respond?



The right honourable the Prime Minister.



Mr. Chairman, the protection of all Canadians and the health of all Canadians is important to this government, and that's why we have taken additional steps within correctional services in order to make sure that security guards and inmates are protected.
We have made some releases.
However, these are very specific cases that represent no or extremely little danger to the public.
We had to strike the right balance, because we need to protect Canadians, and we also need to make sure they are safe, they are all safe.



Mr. Paul-hus.



So will the Prime Minister confirm that no dangerous criminals were released too quickly in order to avoid them having to be exposed to the virus within the prisons?



There are rules and principles in place.
They are strictly followed in order to ensure that there are no releases of people who pose threat to society.



Mr. Paul-hus, you have one minute.



Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, the Chinese government has not been transparent with the rest of the world in terms of the virus.
Australia asked for an in-depth investigation.
Will Canada be standing beside its five eye allies and call on the chinese government to be transparent?



The Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Mr. Chairman, we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the five eyes allies, and we have done that.
They all did that as well with respect to those who were detained in china.
We continue to expect all answers to all our questions be answered, and at the same time we will be working to make sure that Canadians have all the protective equipment they need to get through this pandemic.



The next question will be put by Mr. Blanchet.
Your microphone, Mr. Blanchet.
