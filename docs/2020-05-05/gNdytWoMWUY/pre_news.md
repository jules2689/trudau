# News before the Speech







**Announcer**:

This is a CBC news special presentation.



**Rosemary**:

Hi, everyone.
I'm rosemary Barton here in the nation's capital.
Glad you are joining us once again on CBC television, CBC news network" streaming around the world on our app and CBC.
Ca. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will address Canadians very soon, a little bit earlier than he usually does, expected in just moments.
He is also expected today to announce new financial assistance for farmers.
They are facing a lot of complications because of the pandemic.
Many farmers say the planting and growing season are in jeopardy if they don't get some help.
The relief money could be significant.
I should tell you that the Canadian federation of agriculture was asking for $2.6 billion to help maintain Canada's food security, and it would help a number of farming sectors, obviously, including, as we said, farming itself, vegetables, fruits, but also meat plants, which we know have had a hard time, beef, poultry, pork producers and the food processing sector.
We're also covering developments of that fatal helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week that killed six Canadian forces members.
Today the family of one of them, sub-lieutenant matthew pyke released a very moving statementand we'll share some of that with you if we have the time later.
I'll bring in My colleagues Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane.
I'm being told we have about 30 seconds, so maybe we won't even talk to you.
I will say that agriculture accounts for 11% of Canada's goods gdp, almost 10% of our total merchandise trade.
We have so much.
We produce so much, in fact, that a large part of it is exported to other places.
and it has left farmers and producers in a very difficult situation with a lot of times too much of what they produce and then other times not knowingwhat they should put in the ground because they don't know if there will be a market to sell it within Canada.
We won't talk to the two of you.
We'll talk after.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada now.
