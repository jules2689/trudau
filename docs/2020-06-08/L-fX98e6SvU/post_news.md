# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

This is the Prime Minister of Canada on this Monday giving his daily briefing, which is usually aboutcovid-19. Although today primarily the discussion around anti-black racism protests and policing.
Although a little bit of news there on exemptions on people looking to reunite their families if they got sort of separated between Canada and the United states over the course ofthe past few months.
I'll bring in Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane to walk us through there what we heard.
It is interesting to see how events overtake these press conferences and it becomes solely focused on the pandemic.
In this case, very much in response to what we've seen frompoliticians and people on the street about the past couple of days, anti-black protests, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yes, and lots of interesting comments to dissect.
I think none more significant than the Prime Minister near the end there initially talking about his discussion with RCMP commissioner Brenda Buck this morning and broaching the subject of body cameras for rcmpofficers, but then when pressed by various reporters, including our colleague tom, he basically endorsed the use of or moving forward -- he said moving forward we agree we have to move forward with body cameras.
That was the exact wording, for RCMP officers.
That is significant.
He mentioned that he would be talking to premiers, for example, about policing in general on body cameras for policing in general because jurisdiction is very different when it comes to various police officers and in some cases the RCMP in various provinces.
Where the federal government does have jurisdiction is over certain RCMP members in certain areas of the country, and I'm thinking specifically following the events of last week in Nunavut, where a number of investigations have been launched, six actually since January, into the conduct of RCMP officers there.
I spoke with the mayor and deputy mayor of Iqaluit who, forexample, have taken it upon themselves at the municipal level to introduce various motions and statements in support of making those body cameras mandatory for RCMP officers.
So for the Prime Minister to come out and say that it's something he endorses I think issignificant.
Whether it affects the policy direction of the RCMP going forward is a different subject.
Or not different subject, but it's certainly a different question.
I have not heard the commissioner recently talk aboutit.
He mentioned that in their discussions she brought up some of the challenges, be it economical, be it technical.
There have been two I think distinct studies that have been done, or trials I should say, on the use of body cameras.
It would be interesting to find out from the RCMP exactly the reasons that they have held back on moving forward, but if it is economic, let's say, if it is technical, now that the Prime Minister has pronounced his support for that, what exactly is the federal government prepared to do to make sure that the RCMP can move forward and address those challenges and how quickly could that happen.
and then where does the conversation go with the various provinces who, again, as I mentioned, do have jurisdiction over various policing forces, and even at a municipal level, rather, to a certain degree, depending on the city that you're in. I think this is a definite shift in that conversation.
The fact that it's been studied for a number of years but not really uniformly acted upon tells you that there was this discussion to be had.
I think given the number of questions the Prime Minister got about the symbolism of what he'sdone and said in the last week in support of those protesters, you know, the question has often been to him, what are you going to do about it. [please stand by]obviously there are conversations happening and spurred on by events in this country very much, david.
and I wonder, too, about body cameras for the RCMP.
You know, the RCMP are often in remote areas of the country, sometimes on their own in patrol cars and whether having body cameras would be of help in policing and in sort of the oversight of police as there are, you know, policing forces in this country that have moved in this direction as well.
Calgary is the biggest city where all the officers now have body cams.



**David**:

Yeah, the RCMP in northern Canada, rural Canada and provide some municipal policing as well.
Something the Prime Minister said early in his remark.
The reality is that in people in this country simply do not feel protected by the police.
In fact, they're afraid of them.
and Vassy outlined some of the incidents of the past week.
We had that 22-year-old in Nunavut, an indigenous man knocked to the door -- to the ground by the door of a pick um truck.
and a woman killed in a wellness check by a police officer and of course the alan Adan altercation with the RCMP, which the police do not deny happened.
They just say that it was justified.
One of those was caught onfilm, two of those were not.
and in this day and age, with the issue of police use of force, so front and center, you simply can't rely on citizens with cell phones to capture all of these moments.
You know, it happened in Nunavut and look at the situation in buffalo, for example.
I know it is another country and another police force, but by now a lot of people would have seen the image of the man shoved to the ground and hitting the concrete and blood going everywhere.
The police report said he slipped and fell when video showed he was clearly shoved.
It is an issue that the Prime Minister has acknowledged that people in the country do not feel safe.
They feel threatened by police.
They're afraid of police.
When this technology does exist, let's face it, money is no object right now in terms of dealing with issues.
There's billions of dollars being spent every week.
and if the national police force gets kidded out with body cameras the way they get P.P.E. sprayed, it is going to be very difficult for municipal and provincial police forces to ignore that.
Because you will have a national standard that is -- that will be applied by the RCMP that will create significant political pressure downward for other police forces to get in line.
There was a couple of interesting things for the Prime Minister there to acknowledge up front the severity of the problem and acknowledge the federal government, including his, have simply not done enough and promise change and right off the bat one immediate thing would be the idea of moving it for body cameras of the national police force.



**Rosemary**:

and there was the woman who fell to her death during a mental health call and chief Saunders in Toronto has said that he is open to body cameras and suggested that maybe he could get them in place by September.
That, too, another place where certainly her family feels like body cameras and more evidence of what happened would be helpful and understanding how a woman called -- was called for help and ended up dead when police went into the apartment.
Lots of things there obviously to take in. Let's just quickly go into the exemption part because there are lots of people that have tweeted.
We've seen stories about families separated between Canada and the eye.
and now the government allowing an exemption for a very particular set of people who have been separated from their family, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
and this is something that the Prime Minister hinted a few weeks ago that they were considering.
I'll read the exact wording.
a limited exemption at the border.
He says we will introduce to allow immediate members of citizens or permanent residents to come to Canada.
The Prime Minister also added the caveat that they will, like everyone else who crosses the boards verdict to self-isolate and quarantine for 14 days following when that happens.
I don't know the details on exactly when they will introduce it or if they have to do anything other than just, you know, decide that that's going to be able the case.
But you're right that that there have been a lot of anecdotetal stories of people separated from especially their immediate families so think kids, parents, that kind of thing and separate it at the border and unable to reunite with them and so this looks like it will provide the ability to do so. I'm curious to find out if it will be reciprocated on the other side of the border or how that is going to be coordinated or looked at in the timeline for that.
As soon as I do get those details, I'll make sure or maybe there might be a press release out that I haven't been able to see, but we'll be able to share those.



**David**:

Sorry.
It comes into effect -- the CBS is announcing it basically as of midnight tonight.
June 8, 23:59 for nationals who do not have COVID-19 or exhibit any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and do not have reason to believe they have COVID-19 will be exempt from the prohibition of entering Canada for at least 15 days.
You have to do the 14-day quarantine and that is followed by a specific list of spouse or common-law partner or dependent child, parent or step parent of who exactly qualifies.
Essentially the ban on that, on the family unification thing, if you are coming here for a serious chunk of time, that kicks in essentially at midnight tonight.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you, both.
We await the press conference with cabinet ministers and health care officials.
Obviously the news from the Prime Minister's briefing today really very much in response to those anti-black racism protests that we've seen in the United States and now in this country and the Prime Minister's, you know, admission that this government has done things, needs to do more and will continue a conversation with cabinet this afternoon in order to do so and his essentially his endorsement that body cameras for the RCMP is something that we need to move in the direction of and we know he has been speaking to the commissioner.
So, we'll see where that conversation goes later today.
We have heard, though, over the past number of weeks, of course, that we're an awfully long way away from getting back to normal.
There is a hunt going on for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Big challenges with patient testing, tracking, treatment.
My next guest is part of a vancouver team co-developing a potential anti-body treatment and the first human trial for that right now has already begun.
Joining me from vancouver is carl hanson, c. E.o. Of epsilara.
I know the government has supported epsilar a in this bid so give us a sense of what they're doing and how it might help the rest of us.



Well, it is a bite company -- biotech company in Vancouver that's created a technology that lets you skafn, decode and analyze systems and we applied that to look through the immuno-response of a COVID-19 survivor to isolate the protein that can block the virus and recently we partnered with eli lilly, a global pharma from the United States, and we put it into clinical trial to test for safety.
The next steps is test can this antibody help patients, get better faster and prevent patients from being infected.



**Rosemary**:

So, do we know at this stage whether once you've had COVID-19, you are then immune from it or are we still not sure of that?



**Caller**:

There is good evidence that most patients mount a robust and immune response to COVID-19. There are some reports of patients that have been infected twice.
But those reports are quite rare and I think that the data is not yet conclusive on that.
So, the preponderance of the evidence would sthaug once you've been infected or have a good immuno-response, you're protected from the virus.



**Rosemary**:

Once you've done this phase of the trial, using humans, what do you hope will be the outcome? what is on the other side of that for the rest of us?



Great question.
So, maybe the first thing I would highlight is the speed at which this is going.
Typically once an antibody goes into the clinic, it would take anywhere from two and a half years to five-years to get an approval.
Obviouslily no one has the time wait for that right now so we're working closely with regulatory agencis to expedite this process.
The first trial, which is the phase one that started and was announced last week, is intended to test the safety of the antibodies in patients that are already infected.
The next trials will be in patients that are earlier on in the infection and expect that there will be a series of additional trials designed to test youth patients on this antibody to help them get better or on patients that haven't yet been exposed to protect them from infection in the meantime while we're developing a vaccine.



**Rosemary**:

You talk about the speed of this.
I talked to many scientists working from different places in the country on a vaccine or anti-body tests.
Have you ever seen in your life anything like this in terms of the sharing of information and the cooperation between scientists?



Absolutely not.
The speed is undress -- unprecedented and speaks to the level of cooperation.
It's like running a marathon in an hour.
This is not just fast, this is completely unprecedented and it has been made possible because companies and governments, regulatory agencies Andes the private sector have come noting a way that is truly unprecedented to bring the best technologies forward and that is really being driven by an urgent need and desire by the bio industry to do something about it.



**Marcy**:

What -- where would you say we are about the timeline? maybe next year, certainly beyond.
That's what Teresa tam is saying as well.
Have we shrunk the timeline because of the way you're all cooperating and working together? would you say that we're getting close to some sort of solution here?



Well, five months fog you suggested that someone could go from initiate ago program that we did in March to a phase one clinical trial, you would have thought that's science fiction.
So, we had gone into this projecting that we were ambitiously looking to start a clinical Riel sdwrul.
-- trial in July.
Since then, we managed to beat that deadline.
On the clinical trial development, it is difficult to speculate exactly when the trials would be approved because it depends on the outcome and the patients that we're looking to treat.
But there is good hope, and I think probably reason to suspect that this could be in place by tend of the year.
and various companies have already moved to large scale manufacturing at risk so they will be able to provide the large number of doses that would be needed to meet the patient need.



**Rosemary**:

I know the government last week say they were procuring 37 million syringes in order deal with just this thing if we get closer than we think.
I'll end on this maybe and it is something, again, that the government has talked about in cooperation with gab and other organizations and that is the equity of a distribution of a vaccine.
You know, whether the fact that Canada has invested in epsilara, does that give Canadians an advantage to getting the vaccine? is that something you talk about inside the company?



It's obviously a topic inside the company.
In our community and with government.
Every indication from our partners from the government is the laser focus is bringing something to the clinic and doing something safe and effective and doing whatever is needed, pulling out the stop to get that therapy to as many patients as required.
Those are efforts in the developed world.
There's also some very strong efforts to make these medicines accessible to developing worlds and, of course, that is something that we all want to happen.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. I know you're super busy, but this is such important work.
Thank you for allowing us to pick your brain and highlight it. Appreciate it. That is the c. E.o. Of epsilara.
They are doing those anti-body treatment tests in the clinical trials right now.
That is some sort of encouraging news that all this is happening and we seem to be moving in the right direction on a number of fronts in terms of getting a vaccine or some sort of treatment.
Again, hearing Mr. Hanson say it could be toward tend of the year.
I'm not sure I had heard that timeline before.
But that is some good news for all of us. Obviously we are waiting right now for cabinet ministers to emerge here.
They're a little bit late for their briefing and public health officials to give us the picture of what is happening in the country right now.
I'll bring back My colleagues Vassy kapelos and david Cochrane as we await that.
I AM going to speak to the premier of the Northwest Territories shortly about how they're moving into the next phase of their re-opening.
But probably also a little bit around this policing issue because, of course, she would be on the calls with the Prime Minister that they are having now on a weekly basis and one of those conversations is around policing and certainly the Prime Minister wants to talk more about body cameras this week.
Ok. Everyone has moved into their positions as I was yammering on. So I will come back to you both in a little bit.
Thank you very much.
Here now is the president of the treasury board.



good morning, everyone.
Thank you for being with us again.
Today we'll have the pleasure of hearing from Teresa tam who is Canada's chief public health officer and Dr. Najoo and Dr. Mendochino.
Dr. Tam?



Good afternoon, Bonjour.
At to end of the day Sunday, June 7, there are now 95699 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 7800 deaths.
54233, or 57%, have now recovered.
Labs across Canada have tested over 1, 896, 000 people for COVID-19 to date with about 5% of these testing positive overall.
Over the past week, we have been testing an average of 33, 000 people daily.
and these numbers can change quickly and they are now being updated once daily in the evenings on Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Across the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is continuing to slow down with daily case counts continuing to decrease even in Ontario and xweb.
-- and Quebec.
The trouble spots where COVID-19 transsubmission continuing include a number of outbreaks, but more concerning still are areas with community spread of the virus s. Although outbreaks are problematic, they can be easily -- easier to manage with contact tracing and targeted public health control measures, especially if tied to a single setting.
Community transmission, on the other hand, can be harder to manage, depending on how widespread virus activity is. This is why some of Canada's hotspots have been a persistent challenge , contributing to fluctuations in the national growth rates.
They have been mobilizing more testing.
Taken together, these trouble spots remind us we've got to continue our path down the curve with extreme care, maintaining physical distancing and hygiene practices everywhere to make sure that there are no new flare-ups.
I know it has been difficult dealing with these weeks and months of uncertainty and despite the fact that we're not there yet, and that we still don't know what lies ahead, there is one thing that has become clear -- Canadians will unite with determination to get through adversity together.
and we'll keep on doing it to protect our families, our communities and our society.
When we began this journey, I had belief in the strength of Canadians but what I have seen over these difficult months has been so much more than I imagined and it is enough to give me assurance that we'll get through the uncertainties ahead, too.
Thank you.
Merci.



Thank you very much, Dr. Tam.
Dr. Najoo, please.



Merci.

**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Thank you, doctor.
I'll now give the floor to the Minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship.
Marco?



Thank you.
I'm pleased to be here today to make an important announcement regarding the measures we are taking to protect the health and safety of all Canadians at our borders in. Response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada entered into a reciprocal agreement with the United States banning all nonessential travel between our two countries.
Similar restrictions were put into place for all other international travel.
We also made sure when the special measures came into force that the flow of goods and essential services into Canada would continue unimpeded by allowing temporary workers, students and visa holders to enter in a safe and orderly manner, all of whom are subject to the mandatory 14-day isolation period upon arrival.
This approach has ensured we continue to get access to the food, fuel and medical supplies we need without putting in jeopardy the health and safety of Canadians.
While the border measures have been part of the government's overall response to COVID-19, we also recognize that they have had a significant impact person and discretionary travel.
In some cases, and as a necessary precaution to precaution the risks associated with COVID-19, families have been separated under the terms of the nonessential travel agreement between Canada and the United States.
We acknowledge that this has been difficult.
Where appropriate, our officials at the border have exercised their discretion responsibly to response individual matters on a case-by-case basis.
Over the last several weeks, we've worked hard to address the question of how best to keep families together in a compassionate way but measured against the ongoing concerns related to the transmission of the virus.
Following a review of our current policies, and in consultation with our public health experts as well as the provinces and territories, we now have a path forward.
Today, I AM pleased to announce an exemption turned current travel restrictions that will allow the immediate family members of canadian citizens and permanent residents to enter into Canada.
a number of important conditions must be satisfied before this exemption will apply.
First, immediate family members will be defined as spouses, common law partners, dependent children and their children, parents and legal guardians.
Second, immediate family members must plan to stay in Canada for at least 15 days.
and, third, all other public health care protocols, including screens at the border, remain firmly in place.
Here I would make specific reference to the fact that anybody permitted entry to the family exemption will still have to self-quainter teen for 14 days as soon as they enter Canada.
To be clear, the immediate family exemption does not mean the border will now be open to weekend travelers or those seeking just to attend a personal or social gathering.
For people traveling from abroad, they must still have a valid visa or electronic travel with authorization.
The purpose of this measure is not to allow people to come and go into Canada whenever they like, but rather to help canadian families reunite during this unprecedented time.
Today's announcement represents a responsible step, an incremental step.
One that we will monitor carefully as we continue to maintain the integrity of our borders.
 today I'm pleased to announce an exemption to the immediate families of canadian citizens and permanent residents, but only if they wish to enter Canada for a minimum of 15 days.
Immediate family members will be defined as follows -- spouses, common-law spouses, dependent children and their children, parents and legal guardians.
Allow me to be very clear.
Public health requirements remain in place.
Any person exempted will have to be quarantined for 14 day after entering the country.
This does not mean the border will be open to travelers.
For a weekend or those who want to come into the country to attend an event.
This measure is put in place to help canadian families reunite and not to allow people to come and go as they please.



In closing, COVID-19 remains a concern and we must continue to take measures at the border that are necessary from spreading it and the measures today represent an incremental, responsible and thoughtful response toward that objective.
Thank you.
Merci.







**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Thank you for this important announcement about family reunification.
When they are Canadian citizen or permanent residents, we're now very pleased to answer your questions.



As usual, we'll start with three questions on the phone before we turn to the room.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?



Thank you.
Merci.
Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
 and the first question is from Raymond filion from TVA.



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Good afternoon.
I have a question for Dr. Najoo, and Dr. Tam mentioned, too, but you talked about the importance of maintaining physical distancing and we're not out of the woods yet.
Are you worried about ti mages you saw of the protests that happened this weekend? thank you for the question.
To My mind, there are two important issues here.
The first issue, as we know, is that this is an historic moment in Canada or worldwide really.
As we all recognize the inequalities in our society.
Worldwide and in Canada, we see the systemic racism exists and there is an equality.
I even note as a public health doctor that in equality in our society does have an impact on the health of a large portion of the population.
So, I'm saying this as a specialist in the technical area of public health.
Now what can we do? of course, there are many ways to show everyone that we recognize that inequality, that something has to be done.
The system has to change.
and one of the important things in our democracy is the right to protest.
I do also understand that demonstrations are happening during the COVID-19 pandemic.
So we have to strike a balance.
Speaking strictly from the standpoint of public health.
I said, and Dr. S tam has repeated many times, what are the important measures that have to be practiced to minimize the risk of catching or being contaminated with COVID-19? that's physical distancing, two metres.
If that is not possible, use a mask, a non medical mask or a medical mask.
Have a lot of hand sanitize with you.
Things like that.
Therefore, what I see in these images is that there were many people who participated in these demonstrations and who wore a mask.
In some pictures, I saw that there was quite a good distance between individuals, but honestly there is a possibility that, given what happened, there is some risk.
That's the reality.
I think everyone who participated has done a self-evaluation of their own risk.
They have taken all measures necessary and possible to be as safe as possible.
and that is it. We'll see what will happen in the coming weeks.
Thank you.
Yes, question.
I was at the ottawa demonstration on parliament hill Friday.
There is no physical distancing in most places.
People were very close to each other.
Should we expect an increase in the number of cases? should the Prime Minister who was present be tested? thank you for that question.
Answer.
As we said many times, it is difficult to maintain two metres of physical distancing.
It is important to use other methods, particularly masks and what I saw in the photographs and images, there were many people who did have one.
That's an additional measure for protection.
For all the demonstrators who took part, I think they must continue to practice good personal public health measures.
and it is ams a matter of checking for symptoms.
We are a bit worried because there is the possibility of exposure.
What we know about the incubation period is that normally it takes five, six days, maybe a week.
--



**Rosemary**:

Ok. I'm going to pull away from the press conference briefly.
If you want to continue listening, I'll come back it to. It is on CBC.
Ca. We want to squeeze in an interview here given the time restrictions from the premier.
We know that there are lots of restrictions being lifted across the country and it means that there are a wide variety of businesses and activities resuming in the Northwest Territories.
Cases of the virus remain relatively low.
So, the government is also planning more of the re-opening of the economy and carolyn Cochrane is the premier and joins me now from yellowknife.
Good to see you, premier.



Good morning.
How are you?



**Rosemary**:

I'm good.
Tell me, are you moving into phase two in the northwest territoris? could it happen as early as this week?



It could happen as early as this week.
We went into phase one and then we had to wait for two rounds of incubation period to make sure that we had no cases related to community spread.
So so far we've been fine and we're taught about opening up to phase two.



**Rosemary**:

and what would phase two allow the territory to do?



It allows businesses to open up. Of course, with the proper P.P.E., it allows people to social gather, and more people, allowing up to 50 people in a crowd, again, making sure that they had the social distancing and the masks.



**Rosemary**:

You are doing quite well up there and it might be because of the nature of the territory, how remote it is and the way you can control things.
How many cases have you had in the past couple of months? have you had any new cases?



We've had no new cases since we first -- COVID-19 hit us in early March.
We had five cases.
They were all related to travel.
So far we've had no community spread.
So, we've been very fortunate that way.



**Marcy**:

So, you kept your state of emergency in place in the territory in spite of the fact that you've had no new cases.
Why are you doing that?



The state of emergency protects the -- backs up the chief public health officer.
It keeps us an awareness in case something were to happen, such as price gouging, people refusing to open up a major grocery store, things like that that we might need to address in a timely manner.



**Rosemary**:

You talked about potentially bubbling with the territory of Nunavut.
is that something on the table and likely to happen?



**Caller**:

Absolutely.
--



Absolutely.
Nunavut also has zero cases so we're recognizing that our tourism industry has taken a huge hit.
So we're hoping that if we could open up Nunavut, have a travel bubble between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, that we would allow more people to actually tour, to see the north, which would hem -- help our tourism business and the economy within both territories.



**Rosemary**:

Obviouslily, there might be some tourism between the two territories but probably not a whole lot.
Are you not considering opening up the territory in a broader sense to other Canadians and hoping that they will come and visit or even up to workers because I know there are a lot of people that move in and out of the territory for work.



Yes.
People who come here for work are more than welcome.
Of course, they would have to have the self-isolation plans and work permit.
People that come from other jurisdictions are also welcome but they also need to have a self-isolation plan before they can enter a territory.



**Rosemary**:

Tourism is really not on the table then for you this summer?



Well, tourism is on the table.
I think that it's important to realize that the north has a lot to offer.
It's a beautiful, beautiful country up here.
We have more pristine landscape than anywhere in Canada.
The north has a lot to offer and so we are hoping that people will take the advantage and see our beautiful territory.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
But you have to self-isolate when you arrive.
is that --



Unless you're from the territories.
If you are from the territories, Northwest Territories or Nunavut, once we open up the travel bubbles, then you would haven't to self-isolate.
Coming from the south, of course, you have to self-isolate.



**Rosemary**:

I don't know if you caught the Prime Minister when he came out at 11:15 this morning, premier, he talked about how this week he plans to discuss body cameras with all of you on your weekly call and he said that it is, in his view, probably a good idea for the RCMP to move in that direction.
You have had cases of police -- allegations of police abuse with the RCMP in the territories.
Are you -- how do you feel about the idea of body cameras?



I think that -- there's two sides of argument.
Of course, black lives matter.
We care about -- we're 50% indigenous.
So for us, race -- racism is a huge issue and something we're always combating.
But the RCMP has a tough job as weft it can be very scary at times so I understand their need for protection.
However t use of body cameras will help the public and not only ensure the public are being treated properly but regain that social acceptance of the RCMP.
People are afraid of them right now and so anything we can do to make people realize that the RCMP are friends and they're there to protect us and to make sure that they also follow the law.
No one is above the law.



**Rosemary**:

How ha

So for us, race -- racism is a huge issue and something we're always combating.
But the RCMP has a tough job as weft it can be very scary at times so I understand their need for protection.
However t use of body cameras will help the public and not only ensure the public are being treated properly but regain that social acceptance of the RCMP.
People are afraid of them right now and so anything we can do to make people realize that the RCMP are friends and they're there to protect us and to make sure that they also follow the law.
No one is above the law.



**Rosemary**:

How have you been viewing the examples over the past couple of days, whether it's the shooting of chantal Moore in New Brunswick.



**Rosemary**:

is there anything st anything else that the Northwest Territories need because you are in a specific location.
is there something you feel you're not getting or need more of.



The Northwest Territories started out with what we call an opportunity gap.
It means that we weren't at the same place as our southern jurisdictions.
We don't have the health centers, we don't have the infrastructure and we don't have the roads to access many of our communities.
So, COVID-19 hit us off guard right across Canada.
It highlighted our need that we need to be considered not only the same as our southern jurisdiction, but actually more so. My biggest fear is that we were behind the ball before we started COVID-19 and if we don't get additional federal support, we will be behind and our people suffer.
So, it's naornl we recognize that we cannot base it on per ca pita funding.
It needs to be a special allocation for the north and also that we need flexibility.
It's often that the funding that's let it go by the federal government doesn't meet our needs so we need flexibility within that as well.



**Rosemary**:

So, the $14 billion that the Prime Minister and federal government has put on the table, where do you want much of that money or some of that money to go for you?



At this point, we haven't gone through it as well.
We're still in the beginning of the negotiation stage.
Like I said, we put people into houses, people that were homeless into care.
We've increased our child care supports.
How do I take that back.
Those are wonderful things that have happened and horrible that had to happen because of COVID-19. But we finally got people into homes and we finally got adequate child care.
How do I take that back? I can't. So, those are the things that we're asking for the federal government to consider for us as well.
and our need for infrastructure.
We need work.
We need people to actually have an income in the north.
Our cost of living is at least twice as high as in the south.



**Rosemary**:

Premier, good of you to make the time today.
Thank you so much.



Thank you very much.
Have a great day.



**Rosemary**:

You, too.
Appreciate it. That is Carolyn Cochrane, premier of the Northwest Territories.
We'll zip back now to that briefing by public health officials.
Here now the Minister of immigration.



Creating a family exemption for the immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residentings.
-- residents.
It ensures that the public health care controls remain in place so even where this exemption applies, everyone entering under it must still abide by the mandatory 14-day isolation period.
and with regards to those immediate family members who are related to those who hold valid visas here, this exemption does not apply.
But there is stale residual discretion that looks to ensure the purpose of that travel is necessary without in any way compromising the health and safety of Canadians.



Thank you, Minister.
We will now turn to the room for questions.
Starting with Annie from CTV.



**Reporter**:

Hi, it's Annie bergeron-oliver with CTV news.
So, we're re-opening the border for family reunifications and you talked about the need for 14-day quarantine.
However, I'm hearing from more and more canadian international travelers who will r getting tested the day they come back into Canada and if that test is negative, they are skiping the 14-day quarantine.
One s that accurate? that international travelers when they land in Canada and have a negative test, they no longer have to quarantine.
Two, what assurances do you have that Canadians who are coming in or travelers are, indeed, abiding by that 14-day quarantine rule?



So, your initial statement is incorrect.
Everyone that comes in is not exemption ed like a essential service worker like who's driving a truck and has to go past the border so then everyone is mandated under the quarantine act to be in quarantine for 14 days.
and we were examined the role of laboratory testing but you can imagine if you test negative on the first day, that doesn't actually mean that you're not actually incubating the virus.
Because we know the incubation periods in general is five or six days.
They can be longer than that.
So, the quarantine act, as it stands, requires that 14-day mandatory quarantine.



I have very little to add, other than the exemption for immediate family members still must be subject to the rigorous public health care controls which are in place as a means of reducing the risk of transmission for those entering into Canada.



**Reporter**:

Ok. Great.
You talked about as well that, you know a lot of people are asymptomatic and sometimes the test won't pick it up unless you have enough of the viral load.
You also mentioned that Canadians should be monitoring themselves for symptoms and keeping an eye on it if they attended any of the rallies across Canada this week.
So, what is your advice to Canadians who attended those rallies, including the Prime Minister.
Would you advise them to remain isolated this week and get a COVID-19 test, you know, in five to seven days?



So I think the advisors monitor your symptoms.
However, I think depending on what actually happened to you and in terms of doing the protests and you're concerned about having been exposed, because people sometimes don't wear their masks properly or didn't have access to hand washing, etc., and they're concerned and talk to your public health about getting a test.
I know that, for example, in Ontario -- so if you're in Ottawa, the Ontario public health is open to testing people who are concerned about having been exposed.
So, I think definitely call the health line and follow your local instructions about getting a test.



**Reporter**:

is the system to get a test?



I don't know his particular circumstances but he should evaluate what happened to him and monitor his symptoms and talk to public health and get a test as needed.



Doctor, the only thing I would add to that is if even if you get a test and it's negative, you're not in the clear.
You need keep monitoring for symptoms and become ill, even following a negative test.
It's important to talk to public health and see that maybe you should get another test.
As Dr. Tam and I mentioned, it's very possible that if I don't go out the wrong time, you may be affected with the virus.
But the timing of the test you end up being negative and might have a false sense of assurance saying I'm good.
I don't have the SARS covi-2 virus and then bang, you become ill and you think I might have the negative test, so I might have COVID-19 but that might not be the case.



Thank you, doctor.
a further reminder, one question, one follow-up.



**Reporter**:

Cramped living conditions, working in close proximity and new two deaths of temporary foreign workers.
Does Canada need to rethink how to safely deploy temporary foreign workers in Canada so they can don't put food on the table and what can specifically be done?



Well, let me begin by expressing My sympathy to the two migrant workers that I'm aware of who have passed away from COVID-19 while coming to Canada to ensure that Canadians can still get access to safe and affordable food.
and it goes without saying that we are concerned about the reports of outbreaks on farms and at food processing plants across the country and we're working very, very closely with our provincial partners as well as the farmers and employers who welcome the temporary workers.
We have put into place a number of investments and supports to ensure that every temporary foreign worker can apply their trade in a safe and healthy environment.
We provided $50 million to farmers which would be distributed to workers, $1500 per individual.
We have also put into place a number of inspection powers so that the government of Canada, in conjunction with the province, can actually go to these sites and evaluate whether or not the distancing t accommodations, which were designed to be that -- facilitated by those are taking place.
and I know representatives from our level of government are continuing to undertake those inspections.
and we will continue to examine ways in which we can raise the level of health and safety in our food processing plants and on our farms because we know this is very important.



and what's it going to take to make these conditions safer for these workers? obviously the cramped living conditions are a concern.
But what can be done on the ground to make sure that they're safe?



Well, first and foremost, we need continued collaboration between our federal government and provincial counterparts and for My part I know as well, Minister qualtrough, bi beau and Jordan have been in touch to make sure we're protecting the health and safety of migrant workers and all Canadians who work on farms.
and from that cooperation, we hope to exercise the inspection and regulatory powers that were brought in as a response to COVID-19 and also to look at ways in which we can deliver the financial support that is necessary to create that space and accommodations and which allow workers the distance that they need to abide by the 14-day isolation period, which is one of cornerstones of our strategy in welcoming temporary residents and all returning travelers to Canada.



Thank you, Minister.




**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
The next question is from Lauren gar diner from politico.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi, this question is for Minister Mendocino.
Brian Higgins, a congress in the United States from the buffalo area, has called for the Canadian and United States governments to do more to allow families who are separated by the border to see each other, but also for Americans who own homes in Canada to be able to cross to check on them.
Given today's announcement about families being able to see each other, do you have any response to his ask that Americans or those living on this sigh of the boards er who do own property in Canada, whether they might be able to, at some point this summer b able to check on those properties?



The first thing I would say is that the current nonessential travel agreement that we have in place with the United States is the product of extensive collaboration between our two governments, which is a reflection of the long-standing relationship and close friendship between our two countries as well as the border that we share.
It is fonter -- it is important to note that the exemption we announce today is targeted and focused on immediate family members who have relatives who are canadian citizen and canadian permanent residents as a way to keep them together throughout this very unprecedented time without, in any way, compromising the health and safety of Canadians while we manage our response to the pandemic.
Other areas of travel like the ones you mentioned and the ones that have been discussed south of the border are not captured by this exemption and so we'll still be subject to all of the screen which is we have in place in the border which really attempts to focus the nature of the travel as being essential and nondiscretionary.



Lauren, follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Can you clarify the exemption that was announced today? is that in -- is that effective immediately or is this going to be effective come the next deadline in a couple of weeks? for the agreement to be renewed.



It's already come into force and I believe the effect date is June 5 and we'll verify that for you.



**Caller**:

Thank you, Minister.
Operator, last question, please.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
The last question, 



**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Question, thank you.
My question is for Mr. Mendocino.
You say what has been announced has been in effect for three days now? I think the answer -- I think the clarification here I'm looking to My team here, the law comes into effect today.
Tonight.
That is the clarification.
I apologize.
Midnight tonight.



Now they're all looking and nodding.



**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Ok. So, to be clear it comes into effect tonight at midnight and many people can come into the country starting tomorrow.
Another clarification -- are we talking about people coming through the American border openly or everywhere in the world where separated family members can come back? and I'm wondering how your government can convince the reluctant provinces like Ontario and Quebec to agree to that exemption at the border.
This exemption applies in the context of our agreement with the United States.
This is a product of consultations with our experts.
In public health.
and with a great deal of discussion and consultation with our partners and our provincial counterparts.
Question.
So, only people in the United States who can come back.
is that correct? yes.
Thank you, Minister.
One last question.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Reporter**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Question.
Good morning.
I'd like to get back to the question put by My questions at TVA with regard to anti-racism demonstrations.
What is the recommendation of public health? should these public demonstrations be avoided? and if you don't give that advice, what do you tell to people who complain that theyn't go to church or have funerals for their loved ones?



**Rosemary**:

Ok. We'll pull away from this federal briefing.
We essentially heard that question already and the question was whether people should be out protesting during a pandemic.
His response was people should wear masks and find physical distance when possible.
Which isn't always possible but that is a decision that people are clearly making based on what they're willing to risk and their own risk.
Risk and how important that risk is for them.
Let's bring back Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane to talk about what we heard.
I'll recap what we heard there from the Minister of immigration, that those measure go into effect as of midnight tonight that.
Will allow some families to be re United, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
That is the main COVID-19-related announcement from the federal government today.
As of mid night, if you are an immediate family member of a canadian citizen or permanent resident and not exhibiting -- and this is important -- any COVID-19 related symptoms or don't have any reason to believe that you might have contracted the virus, you will be except from the restrictions that are currently in place at the border and those retr*ixs are unless your travel is essential so it has nothing to do with leisure or travel, period, you cannot across the border this.
Provides an exemption at midnight and there is a list, and I'm sure our website will have it soon of exactly who, what any immediate family member means, so it is a spouse or common-law parent or child or step-parent or parent or child.
The exact wording will be up shortly.
That is in the context of the bigger agreement with the United States that was just renewed a few week ago for another 30 days and that is the general timeline of the agreement each time it is renewed.
This is really the first sort of relaxing of those restrictions, though.
So, keen to see what that means.
Also important that you have to self-isolate, as anyone does when you cross the border, for 14 days.
That remains a strong caveat to this exemption.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
Doesn't mean that you can visit your family or Canada in the eye.
-- in the United States.
This is about reuniting people who were maybe cut off during the pandemic and need see one another in these particular circumstances that you outlined there.
and David, maybe just -- we'll just end on body cameras because we did -- that was what the Prime Minister talked about today and it was what I put to the premiers in the Northwest Territories who seem very much open to the idea as well, while recognizing that there are some limitations obviously to it but it might be a welcomed addition to the RCMP in hearer the.



I'm told that the body camera endorsement by the Prime Minister today will be the first a series of concrete steps on improving policing and race relations and the confidence of racialized Canadians and indigenous Canadians in policing.
You can look broadly at better civilian review, race-based stats on arrest and emphasis on the use of force and deescalation.
But the body cam endorsed by the Prime Minister, an important first step on that, it's not definite.
It's not done.
They need figure out the logistics and the finances of this and raise it with the premiers to see how it trickles down the provincial and municipal levels and also for RCMP officers contracted to work for provincial governments.
So, it is not a super quick and easy thing they can do but the Prime Minister is throwing his weigh behind it. That is something that matters.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you both very much for your coverage today.
and that ends our coverage here today for COVID-19 special.
a lot of talk today really about policing.
We'll have more of that through the day as the Prime Minister meets with cabinet later today.
I'm rosemary Barton.
