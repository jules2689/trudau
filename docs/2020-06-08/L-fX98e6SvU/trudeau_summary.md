It's about the fact that people are all too often treated like criminals instead of receiving the support that they need.
We knew that this work had to beinformed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and indigenous peoples.
So we listened, and we worked together to change things.
We worked to close the gaps in services for indigenous communities.
and this work culminated in the strategy for 2019-2022 and the creation of an anti-racism secretariat.
Together we have made progress, progress that has meant support for groups like the black healthalliance and new schools for indigenous kids.
With the many disturbing reportsof violence against black Canadians and indigenous people, we know that we need to do much more.
and later today -- on reconciliation to discuss our work with indigenous communities.
I AM committing to you that thiswork will continue to acceleratethe pace of change, because you deserve real commitments as quickly as possible that addresses the root causes of these problems.
We have to work together and we have to work hard.

[ end of interpretation ]on Friday I announced that the federal government would contribute $14 billion towards asafe re-start agreement with theprovinces and territories for the things that all Canadians need as we get our country back up and running.
Right now we're working with thepremiers on what this re-start could look like in the coming months.
and as we do that, we're stayingfocused on people's new realities.
If you work in a hospital, or ina business that's reopening, you'll need P.P.E.
[voice of interpreter]the provinces and territories are all facing different realities right now, and we have to consider that as we look to the next steps, but wherever youlive, we are working with your premier to reach a re-start agreement that will allow us to protect your health and safety together.
So we will be introducing a limited exemption that will allow members of the immediate family of citizens or permanent residents to enter Canada, mainly spouses, children and theparents of minor children.

That's why we're bringing in a limited exemption to allow immediate family members of citizens or permanent residents to come to Canada.
I know that Minister mendiccino will have more to say about all of this later today.
