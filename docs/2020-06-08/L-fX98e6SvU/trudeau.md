# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to begin this morning by reflecting on the reports and videos that have continued to surface the last few days on violence against indigenous and racialized people.
On Friday I went to a rally on parliament hill to show My support and listen to what community and black leaders are calling for.
I hear you and I see you.
As you call out systemic discrimination, racism and unconscious bias, as you call for action and as you call for it now.
[voice of interpreter]our communities are suffering from inequality and racism at this time, including during thispandemic.
All you have to do is look at a map of the cases of COVID-19 in toronto and montreal to see thatblack Canadians are harder hit by COVID-19. I AM here and I AM listening to the demands of black Canadians.
I hear you denounce systemic discrimination, racism, unconscious bias, things that persist in our society.
and I'm ready to take action.
[ end of interpretation ]the reality is that many people in this country simply do not feel protected by the police.
In fact, they are afraid of them.
That alone would be bad enough, but systemic discrimination and racism in Canada goes much further than just policing.
It's about poverty and mental health.
It's about the fact that people are all too often treated like criminals instead of receiving the support that they need.
We, as governments, need to worktogether.
We, as leaders, need to recognize that these problems are tied to economic inequality and the racialization of poverty.
and we need bold measures to address this.
Our government promised to address systemic racism and injustice.
We knew that this work had to beinformed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and indigenous peoples.
So we listened, and we worked together to change things.
We invested in mental health resources and youth programs forblack Canadians.
We worked to close the gaps in services for indigenous communities.
We funded statistics Canada so they could create a gender, diversity and inclusion statistic hub.
and this work culminated in the strategy for 2019-2022 and the creation of an anti-racism secretariat.
Just last fall we appointed a Minister to focus specifically on diversity and inclusion.
Together we have made progress, progress that has meant support for groups like the black healthalliance and new schools for indigenous kids.
But I hear you when you say thatit isn't enough.
I hear you when you say that it doesn't solve systemic racism, and I agree.
With the many disturbing reportsof violence against black Canadians and indigenous people, we know that we need to do much more.
and we need to do it now.
I had a discussion with cabinet on Friday that will continue later today.
I also spoke with commissioner lucci of the RCMP this morning.
The commissioner ensured me thatshe will use all available toolsto take quick solid action.
On our call, one of the things we discussed was the adoption ofbody cameras.
I'm committing to raising this with the provinces this week so we can move forward as quickly as possible.
Minister blair has also reaffirmed to me his commitment to improving indigenous policing.
and later today -- on reconciliation to discuss our work with indigenous communities.
I AM committing to you that thiswork will continue to acceleratethe pace of change, because you deserve real commitments as quickly as possible that addresses the root causes of these problems.
[voice of interpreter]things must change, but fixing centuries of injustice, exclusion and violence are not things that can happen overnight.
We have to work together and we have to work hard.
Today I AM pledging to continue to lead the charge, and our government will be working as well and as quickly as possible to build a country that is more just and better with you.
[ end of interpretation ]there's no doubt that the last few months have been harder thananyone could have expected.
This pandemic has meant different challenges for everyone.
But no matter who you are and nomatter what you're dealing with, a little bit of help can make all the difference.
Maybe your employer has been able to keep you on the payroll because of the wage subsidy, a program that's supporting 2.5 million jobs.
Perhaps you got some extra pep through the Canada child benefitor you'll receive more money with the top-up to your old age security, or you might even be one of the 500, 000 young people who has accessed the student benefit, helping you pay for next year's tuition.
[voice of interpreter]in recent months we've been working hard to help people get through this crisis, and the programs we've introduced and the investments we've been making are making a real difference.
I'm thinking, for example, of a story I was told about a montreal firm called franklin empire that manufactures electrical goods.
That family business has been around for four generations and employs more than 500 people in Quebec and Ontario.
The business was doing fine, butwhen the pandemic hit, they had to shut down their production line.
They wanted to keep their employees, but they couldn't do that on their own.
and that's where the emergency wage subsidy comes into play.
They were able to rehire all their employees, and with our help provide them with a full salary.
We're talking about 500 persons and their families now receivingtheir paycheque as usual in spite of the pandemic, and this is only one example, but it doesshow why programs like the emergency wage subsidy are so important.
But we know that there's still alot of work to be done.
[ end of interpretation ]on Friday I announced that the federal government would contribute $14 billion towards asafe re-start agreement with theprovinces and territories for the things that all Canadians need as we get our country back up and running.
Right now we're working with thepremiers on what this re-start could look like in the coming months.
and as we do that, we're stayingfocused on people's new realities.
If you work in a hospital, or ina business that's reopening, you'll need P.P.E. To stay safe.
If you're back on the job, you might need transit, child care or the option to take time off if you are ill.
If you're a senior, or at higherrisk from COVID-19, you may needsome extra support.
These are the things that Canadians are thinking about, soit's what we're thinking about too.
[voice of interpreter]the provinces and territories are all facing different realities right now, and we have to consider that as we look to the next steps, but wherever youlive, we are working with your premier to reach a re-start agreement that will allow us to protect your health and safety together.
In addition to cooperating on that agreement, the premiers andmyself have also discussed aboutcanadians who are separated fromtheir family members because of the border closure.
Obviously we want families to betogether, but our priority remains the safety of all Canadians.
So we will be introducing a limited exemption that will allow members of the immediate family of citizens or permanent residents to enter Canada, mainly spouses, children and theparents of minor children.
But I want to be absolutely clear, any person entering Canada will have to self-isolatefor 14 days.
I know that Minister mendiccino will have more to say about thislater today.
[ end of interpretation ]this is an incredibly difficult time to be apart from a spouse, a child, a mom and dad.
We hear that.
That's why we're bringing in a limited exemption to allow immediate family members of citizens or permanent residents to come to Canada.
I want to be clear, though, anyone entering the country willbe required to quarantine for 14days.
If you don't follow these rules, you could face serious penalties.
I know that Minister mendiccino will have more to say about all of this later today.
[voice of interpreter]I know that after this difficultspring a lot of people are hoping that the summer will be easier to deal with.
Things are starting to improve for many people, but we know there's still a lot of work to be done, and Canadians can counton our support in the months andweeks to come.
Thank you.
