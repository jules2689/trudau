**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're working together to support international efforts to develop a vaccine, expand treatment, expand testing and ensure that critical medical supplies get to the frontlines.
As I've said before, this is a global crisis and it demands a global response.
While we're doing everything to keep people safe in our respective countries, we have to help more vulnerable nations by providing more support for their healthcare systems, debt relief and other systems.
We will keep working together as partners to ensure the health and safety of those around the world.
 

[voice of interpreter] our government has introduced a series of measures to help people get through these difficult times because of the pandemic.
With the emergency wage subsidy, we are allowing more people to continue to receive a wage, even if the company they work for ha shad to slow down or completely shut down its activities.
With the Canada emergency response benefit, we are giving $2, 000 a month to people who are unable to earn a living because of the virus.
Yesterday, we announced that we would be relaxing the eligibility criteria to allow more people to receive the help that they need.
If you're a seasonal worker or if you earn less than $1, 000 per month or you recently exhausted your employment insurance benefits, the emergency response benefit will be there for you.
At the same time, we're working with the provinces and territories to top-up the wages of essential workers who earn less than $2, 500 a month.
Caregivers and nursing assistants and others who are working hard to maintain a semblance of normality and who are doing extraordinary work canbe helped.
They deserve not only our recognition and gratitude, but our support.
Tonight I will be discussing that with My colleagues from theprovinces and territories at ourweekly meeting.
We will be talking about how we can better protect our seniors who are in seniors' residences or in long-term care facilities.
Last night the Minister of public safety, bill blair, received an official request from the government of quÉbec tolend a Land to healthcare workers.
We are working closely with quÉbec to finalize an assistanceplan and we will have more news to share with you soon.
I can tell you now that we will be giving them every possible form of assistance, including the canadian red cross, the armed forces, and specialized volunteers who have registered with health Canada.
We will always be there for Canadians in difficulty.
Another issue that often comes up at our weekly meetings with the premiers is the supply of medical equipment.
I can confirm this morning that the government has finalized contracts with a number of canadian businesses, including geometric energy corporation of calgary, which will be providingmillions of gloves to our healthcare workers.
Later today Minister anand will provide an update with respect to recent developments when it comes to supplieses.


[end of translation] over the past few weeks we've rolled out a series of measures to get people the help they need as quickly as possible.
As things evolve, we're hearing from Canadians who need more help, from businesses who need more support.
No one should feel as if they'realone in this fight.
Our government is here to help you through these challenging times.
So when we hear the program is not reaching as many people as it should, we make changes.
a few weeks ago we launched the Canada emergency business account to help small businessesstruggling with cash flow.
Under this program, banks are offering $40, 000 loans which areguaranteed by the government.
To date, more than 195, 000 loanshave been approved.
We're talking about more than $7.5 billion in credit to small-and medium-sized businesses.
It's a start, but Minister ng and others have heard from business owners who could use this help but who don't fit the current eligibility criteria.
So we're going to make adjustments because we want to be there to support you.
Today we are expanding the Canada emergency business account by decreaing the eligibility threshold.
Now businesses who spent between$20, 000 and $1.5 million in total payroll in 2019 will be eligible to receive a loan through the ceba.
That's businesses who spent between $20, 000 and $1.5 millionin total payroll in 2019 will now be eligible.
This is money entrepreneurs and employers can use to cover operational costs and help with other immediate needs.
Businesses and commercial property owners are also facing specific challenges because of COVID-19, so we plan on introducing the Canada emergencycommercial rent assistance.
This program will provide support to help small businesseswith their rent for the months of April, may, and June.
To implement this program, we have to work with the provinces and territories as they govern rental relationships.
We hope to have more details to share very soon.
 

[voice of interpreter] a few weeks ago, weintroduced the emergency business account.
Under this program, the banks can offer guaranteed loans of $40, 000 to eligible companies tohelp them with their cash flow.
Up until now, more than 195, 000 loans have been approved.
We're talking about more than$7.5 billion in credit for small- and medium-sized companies.
That is a start, but Minister ngand others have been talking to a number of employers who need that financial assistance but are not currently eligible for the program.
So today we are expanding the business account by increasing and lowering the eligibility thresholds.
Now companies that have spent between $20, 000 and $1.5 millionin payroll in 2019 can apply to receive a guaranteed loan.
This is funding that superstructures and employers will be able to use to meet their cash flow requirements andpay other expenses.
Furthermore, businesses and commercial building owners are facing particular problems because of COVID-19. Our government has, therefore, decided to introduce the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance.
This measure will provide support for small businesses to help them pay their rent in the months of April, may, and June.
To implement that program, we will have to cooperate with the provinces and territories because they are responsible foreverything relating to rent and we hope to have more details to share soon.


[end of translation] over the past weeks we've had to get usedto this new normal.
It has been snowing in some places this week, including herein ottawa, because that's just what 2020 brings.
We hope that the weather will get nicer.
As time goes on, staying home and not seeing friends will be more difficult.
We're going to miss our colleagues, friends, neighbours, and our parents even more than we do now, but we have to be disciplined.
We must stay the course.
We cannot let the progress we'vemade go to waste.
Above all, we cannot put lives at risk.
Let's keep following public health recommendations.
Wash your hands.
Stay home as much as possible.
and if you do go out, be sure tostay at least 2 metres away fromothers.
If we persist and persevere, I know that we will prevail.
Once again, thank you all for joining us. I'm now happy to take questions.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone lines for questions, one question and one follow-up. Operator.
