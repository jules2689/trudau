**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily COVID-19 briefing.
You could see there on the trees behind him, a touch of Nova Scotia tartan to commemorate the victims lost last weekend because there is a virtual vigil this evening.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos andcatharine Cullen to speak what the Prime Minister had to say.
Vassy, I'll let you go first.



**Vassy**:

The announcement highly anticipated by small business owners who are worried about having to pay rent in a few days' time or on May 1. This will allow commercial property owners to reduce the rent so the business owner is only paying a quarter of it. Other than that, they'll provide forgivable loans to the landlord, about half of the remaining balance in order for the overall rent to be reduced, but specifically the rent for the small business owner to be reduced.
The key take-away is who qualifies.
So you have to pay less than $50, 000 in rent and also has to show that their revenues have dropped by 70%. the Prime Minister signalled that there would be additional help coming for bigger businesses where rent is higher than $50, 000.
He didn't specific what that rent would be. For me the big take-away and outstanding questions is how fast will this work and can the money get out the door.
There were questions to the Prime Minister from businesses who already had to close becausethey weren't able to pay their April 1 rent.
In this province, Ontario, if you didn't pay that rent, the landlords could kick you out by April 16. The landlords need that rent to pay their mortgage.
This is a cyclical thing and will be welcome news for businesses worried about this very specific issue, but it willdepend on how fast that money can get out the door.



**Rosemary**:

As I said, because they have access to the loan, the $40, 000, $10, 000 of which would be forgivable, you can imagine that the owner of the business could go rent free for a period of time if they are able to tap into the loan as well even if they're having financial problems.
Catharine, I'll get you to weigh in on this because I know you'reworking on it today.
I'm struck that they were able to come up with a deal with the provinces because this is provincial jurisdiction and they did manage to get that done relatively quickly.



**Catherine**:

a lot of discussion about federal and provincial jurisdiction.
Another thing the prime minister raised there a top-up for essential workers, which is going to be a key element in trying to address the situation in long-term care homes in particular.
The Prime Minister signalling those discussions are still underway of how that would work.
The provinces will have quite a bit say in who is deemed an essential workers, but obviouslylong-term care workers, those financially vulnerable, would bereceiving this money.
Yesterday we heard scott moe, the Saskatchewan premier, outlining his province's five-phase plan for reopening.
We are expecting to hear from premier blair Higgs who have a four-phase plan.
The Prime Minister saying there are going to be guidelines, elements he said, that they hopethat the whole country can agreeon in terms of where the standards are for how this reopening happens.
He was asked by our colleague salimah shivji whether or not anything is going to be hand tory was the gist of the question.
He said there are principles andelements that should be in placeand should be followed.
So it will be interesting to seehow that balance is struck between what the federal government is looking for here and what the provinces want to do.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, because the federal government can say things and give guidance.
It doesn't mean the provinces need to follow that to the letter.
We will come back to you, Vassy and Catharine.
I want to talk about how the Prime Minister started his briefing.
I'm now talking about Nova Scotia.
There will be an online vigil tonight to remember the victims.
We reached Cory tinny, from a community that neighbours Portapique.
Thank you for joining us.



**Interview**:

Thanks for having us.



**Rosemary**:

Lots of people are -- I don't know if looking forward is the right word, but people are anticipating this tonight because they are desperate to connect with one another now.
Tell me what people can expect and why you wanted to do it.



**Interview**:

Sure.
Tonight's event is going to consist of messages from political figures as well as spiritual leaders, musicians andcelebrities.
The reason I guess is there is group of us, several dedicated volunteers, who have been working together to put this together for the community, the province, the country, but especially the families.



**Rosemary**:

How important do you think this will be, given the fact that no one can really get together right now because of the pandemic?



**Interview**:

Extremely.
It's vital.
Typically we would be gathering together at churches and community centres, but we can't right now.
We have to do something.
This is a great way for us to come together for an hour and a half to celebrate the lives of these fantastic people and to help our community start to heal.



**Rosemary**:

You said you're going to have some celebrities.
I would not be doing My job as journalist if I didn't ask you to give us some of a hint about who we might hear from or who would have a message for Nova Scotia?



**Interview**:

I would love to be able to do that.
I just encourage everyone to join us and tune in and we can celebrate together.



**Rosemary**:

You're good at your job if you're not answering.
Let me get a sense -- I know you're a community over from Portapique.
I don't know the region very well, but Brett Ruskin is painting the picture of the place for us. How are people doing, given the community and the way they live together?



**Interview**:

I don't -- I thinkwe're still in a state of shock here.
We haven't had time to process this.
It's been a matter of days.
That's all I can really say.
I mean, devastation.
I hope the vigil tonight will Bethe start of a healing process, but time will tell.



**Rosemary**:

Did you know anyone that was killed, Tory? is that part of why you wanted to do this?



**Interview**:

In these communities, you don't have to look forward to connect people.
My personal reasons are just I had an opportunity to work with this amazing group of volunteer sand I just couldn't say no to that.
It just went from there.
I'm honoured to be a part of it.



**Rosemary**:

We're pleased you're doing it. Our thanks to all the volunteers who put this together so quickly.
It will be an important moment for Nova Scotia and the entire country.
Tory phinney, thank you.
I appreciate it. Tory phinney is one of the organizers of the vigil.
Don't forget you will be able to watch it live here on CBC news network as well as CBC throughout the Atlantic provinces.
It starts at 7:00 p. M. Atlantic time, 6:00 p. M. eastern.
Make sure you tune in for that.
I'm rosemary Barton.
Continuing coverage on CBC news network and CBC News.
Ca. [ please stand by ]-- there's a detailed timelineon how the shooting rampageplayed out that left 22 peopledead last weekend.
It includes chilling details howthe gunman was able to carry outthose killings and elude lawenforcement for 13 hours untilhe was then killed by the RCMP.
All of this, of course, as thercmp continue to face questionsabout the response and why theemergency alert was notactivated.
We'll also as I mentionedearlier talk about that virtualvigil for 6:00 p. M. easterntime.
Let's bring in cbc's brettruskin in Portapique again todayto go through what we found outfrom the RCMP.
There were lots of sort of --sort of jaw-dropping details, brett.
In particular, we now know thatthe fact that the gunman wasdressed as a police officer andhad an RCMP vehicle certainlyseemed to allow him to eludepolice and resulted in otherdeaths.



**Reporter**:

That's right.
So, I mean, let me situate us to where we are here first of all.
The police blockade there, that's the one road toportapique, Nova Scotia and you can see a memorial with people gathering to lay flowers and notes for the victims' families.
It was down this roadway that this all began.
and there were perimeters set up by the RCMP and this being one road there may have been one here and another intersection down the road from there that could have been another set where a perimeter was set up. We heard from the superintendent that in his 30 years of policing that he can't think of anymore horrific of a circumstances than looking for someone who looks like you.
That's what officers were doing.
They were searching for as hooter who looked like them in their uniform, in their policecar.
It must -- it perhaps assisted them or facilitated his escape from those perimeters because he was in that car.
That is a possibility if there'scars going around and you heard that there were 25 units that utresponded to the scene and her ewe heard that it may have been going through a field at onepoint, that could have been thesuspect.
That could have been the shoot eras well.



**Rosemary**:

and we certainly know that when he was apprehended he was no longer in that vehicle and no longer in the uniform which he haddiscarded.
So that also became part of how they captured and killed thegunman, too, Brett?



**Reporter**:

He didn't have the vehicle -- but I wanted to mention one more fact about the fact that he had these clothing as well as the vehicle.
The RCMP vehicle.
Because we had heard rumours about this but it was confirmed in this news conference that at least one situation and, again, with a police officer himself, he pulled someone over, using his replica police car, walked up to that person as if they were being pulled over by genuine authentic policeofficer, and walked up to their window and shot them in theircar.
So just horrific details thatwe're hearing.
and the police car that he wasdriving, the replica police car, was then swapped out and he took silver s. U.v. and then a thirdvehicle, which was a mazda whichhe acquired by killing theoccupant of that vehicle, a54-year-old woman fromschubanacadie and went to nearthe international airport hereand that is where he encounteredan officer who spotted him, recognised him, and then openedfire and killed him there inthat gas station.
That is how all of this wrappedup after, again, 14 hours ofthis manhunt that began here andended far away, nearly 100kilometres away, in nova scotiain enfield.



**Rosemary**:

Brett ruskinagain in Portapique, novascotia, thank you, Brett.
I appreciate it. and let's highlight a couple things that stood out to me because they're questions that may come up as well.
First of all, that one of theguns, one of the weapons that the gunman used was traced back to Canada.
But others seem to have been from the United States.
So there were questions how he was able to get theme here from the United States.
and the RCMP is suggesting today that there appeared to be a list of individuals that the gunman was targeting because he went to particular homes and knocked on the door, including one home where they would not let him in. and so they talked a little bit about that as well.
and there were also questions about the emergency alert, again, the RCMP saying they had believed they had contained the area which was not the case as we now know.
We'll continue that coverage through the day and on to the vigil later tonight.
Let's bring in Katherine culleyand Vassy kapelos as we wait for the federal ministers.
Vassy, I know that you'll be part of the vigil later on. and let me get you to quickly weigh in on the issue there is resonate with questions on the federal level, the guns are certainly important and the emergency alert as well.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, the emergency alert for sure.
We heard from the RCMP today that at the time they felt that the suspect dead or alive was within the perimeter they had secured but that alert, therefore, didn't go out and it came out on Twitter.
So still questions on that.
and also accountability questions that you heard at the end of the presser there with the Prime Minister aroundresources, rural resources with the RCMP.
and that's a shared jurisdiction between the federal government and the province and it took me about 30 seconds to look up study that the committee did on public safety looking into thatissue.
That firmly established that resources there were wanting.
Going ahead we don't have all of the details but those will persist as questions too.



**Rosemary**:

I'll turn away and bring us to the federal briefing led by deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
Let's bring that to you nowlive.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

We are going to end this press conference at 1:00 p. M. sharp, indeed, a few moments before1:00 p. M. in order to observe minute of silence to honour and mourn the victims of the nova Scotia shooting.
Okay, Dr. Tam, please.

**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

and now bill morneau.
Bill, please.



**The Hon. Bill Morneau**:

Well, thanks, Chrystia, and goodafternoon.
Today I'd like to talk a little bit about small businesses and know that My colleague will be talking about the same subject after me. We know that so many small businesses have been hit so hard during the course of thiscovid-19 crisis.
So what we want to talk about today is a programme that will help them with their rentpayments.
For the last week or so we have been working together with provincial and territorial partners to bring significant relief to struggling smallbusinesses.
and I'm pleased to say that we now have agreements in principle with all of the territories and provinces to offer the canadaemergency commercial rent assistance programme.
Through the Canada mortgage and housing corporation, we'll offer qualifying commercial property owners forgivable loans that will cover 50% of impactedtenants' rent.
In exchange for them providing aren't reduction of at least 75%and agreeing to a moratorium onevictions.
and we know that this is workingtogether.
We all have to do our part in supporting those who are facing economic hardships.
The Canada emergency rent assistance programme is available for qualified property owners with tenants that pay less than $50, 000 a month inrent, and that have experienced at least a 70% decrease in theirrevenues.
Eligible tenants will include small businesses, non-profit andcharitable orginisations.
Eligible landlord whose havealready stepped up and offered75% or more reductions for aprilor may, or who would like toretroactively do so can apply.
We expect that this new benefitwill be available starting inmid-may.
With the first month of itaround the corner, we're askingthat landlords try to beflexible as they work with theirtenants in the coming days.
(voice of translator): we nowhave an agreement in principlewith all provinces andterritories to offer emergencyassistance to commercialproperty owners to help smallbusinesses that have been hardhit by the crisis through thecanadian housing and mortgagecorporation.
We will be providing the ownersof commercial buildingsforgivable loans that cover 50%of the risk.
In exchange for a reduction inthat rent of ant least 75%. and that those owners also agreeto a moratorium on evictions.
The programme will be offered to the owners of commercialproperties who pay less than$50, 000 per month in rent.
and who have seen a loss of atleast 70% in their revenues.
It includes small businesses, not-for-profit orginisations andcharitable orginisations.
and the building owners who haveoffered this 75% rent relief totheir tenants can also send inan application retroactively.
This programme will be availableas of mid-may.
[end of translation]this protects on top of theinterest-free business accountloans with forgivable portionsof up to 25%, it's on top ofalso the Canada emergency wagesubsidy benefit and, of course, it's in addition to the deferralof income taxes, g. S.t., h. S.t. Payments and customs duties.
Finally, we're also providingsignificant credit supportthrough the business developmentbank and export development bankof Canada.
and for people, the canadaemergency response benefit forthose of you who are off fromwork or on furlough.
Our response to the COVID-19economic response plan is amongthe most ambitious and generousamong g7 countries, because webelieve that by taking actionnow we will be more prepared to get out of this challenge when we get through it. So, thank you very much, thankyou, Chrystia.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Okay, thank you very much, bill.
and now we will hear from our minister of small business, export promotion and trade, marying.
Mary, please.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Hello, everyone.
[end of translation]and for those communities acrossthe country, more help is on theway.
You just heard that from thefinance Minister.
We know that in this difficulttime that many of you arestruggling to keep those lightson.
and you're making incrediblesacrifices to help Canadians tostay safe by flattening thecurve and temporarily closingyour doors down in many cases.
While we have seen a severedownturn in businesses where youhad to close because of COVID-19it doesn't mean that yourcommercial rent payments havestopped.
We put help out there to helpwith expenses by deferringcustoms payments and a varietyof lending supports and we haveheard loud and clear from smallbusiness owners that you needhelp with your rent.
and today is that relief.
and we're promoting forbusinesses having hardship forpayments for April, may andjune.
and under these rent agreementswe're going to be able toprovide forgivable loans toincentivize the commercialproperty owners to help theirsmall business tenants withrents by at least 75% and torefrain from evictions.
(voice of translator): this isabout supporting smallbusinesses.
It's those who need our help themost.
[end of translation]and they made a tough decisionto close their doors and now to be helped with their rentpayment that.
Local furniture store thatrelies on foot traffic to stayafloat to cover the cost oftheir space.
Or that self-employed beautysalon owner who can't take onclients right now so she'll be able to keep up with her rentuntil it's safe to open up herdoors again.
Our work is far from over andwe're listening and we're goingto keep asking and we'll keepsupporting you every step of theway through this crisis.
I want to thank canadian smallbusiness owners for theirresilience during this period.
Merci.beauc owrch p. (voice of translator): thankyou very much.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Thank you, Mary.
and now from Minister navdeepbains.
Navy, please.



**GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. [Speaking French](Voice of Translator)**:

I'mhappy to be here today to update you on our industrial mobilization efforts.
In addressing --[end of translation]our approach has been the samefrom the start -- companiesreach out to us online throughour portal.
Nearly 6, 000 since the start amonth ago.
and we look at these offersagainst the needs of Canadians.
When there's a promising matchwe sign a letter of intent andthen we work with the company tosupport re-tooling and oftenthis means bringing companiestogether in new partnerships andsupply chains.
Finally we finish by signing acontract for purchase.
I'll start with some progress onthe letters ON intent formedical gowns.
We facilitated thetransformation of constructionhouse wrap from intertap polymerand airbag materials intofabrics that meet the strictrequirements that are necessaryto use in the manufacturing ofmedical-grade gowns.
By connecting these two firmswith canadian apparelmanufacturers from acrosscountry, they can now sewmedical gowns with thismade-in-Canada fabric, effectively by-passing thefabric shortages with anentirely new supply chain.
This is enabling us to moveforward from letters of intentto contracts, with george curry, udel and yoga jeans.
These companies joined the ranksof stanfield and calco group andcanada goose as canadian apparelcompanies stepping up to providecritical medical gowns.
In total, contracts with theseseven companies have resulted inmore than 18 million gowns withdeliveries starting this week.
I'll share one more example ofhow these new partnerships inthe canadian industry havehelped us in the fight againstcovid-19. a producer of testing re-agents in New Brunswick was in shortsupply of chemicals forproduction.
Having reached out to us throughthat portal that I mentionedearlier, we connected them tochemical supplies in Canada sothey could keep on producingre-agents that are critical totesting.
Now let me move on to there-tooling efforts on faceshields and masks.
Canadian manufacturers havestepped up in difficult times tore-tool in the fight againstcovid-19. and many of them are fromautomotive sectors, a sectorthat I'm very familiar with.
I started My career in thatsector.
and we're working on contractsof more than a dozen companiesthat would deliver millions offace shields, including thelikes of windsor mold, dinaplasand ink smith and this allows usto meet the requests fromprovinces and territories withcanadian supplies.
We've also signed a letter ofintent with general motors andthey're working to re-tool itsoshawa assembly plant to helpwith the mask production here incanada and we're assisting themin this process.
(voice of translator): iapplaud all of the companies whohave re-tooled to assist inthese efforts to strengthen ourdomestic supply chain.
[end of translation]thank you very much.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Okay, thank you, Navy, and now we hear from the Minister of public service and procurement.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Thank you, Chrystia.
Hello, everyone.
[end of translation]before I begin let me say thatas someone born and raised innova scotia that My heart goesout to everyone who lost lovedones and friends this pastweekend.
This tragedy comes as we work tocontain COVID-19, making it everso difficult to grieve together.
From spending the first 18 yearsof My life in Nova Scotia, iknow that Nova Scotians are veryclosely knit group.
In these tragic times know thati and all of Canada stands withyou.
(voice of translator): as wecontinue to fight the spread ofcovid-19, My departmentcontinues to make aggressive andproactive purchases of thepersonal protective equipmentand medical supplies that willhelp see us through thispandemic.
[end of translation]today I will be addressinginternational procurements, domestic production and I willprovide an update on ourprocurements.
Given the intense global demandfor equipment and supplies, weare facing many challenges.
Much of the world's supply ismanufactured in china and movingmaterials out of that country ishighly complex.
We have experienced challengesas the Prime Minister discussedearlier this week.
I want to reassure canadiansthat we continue to adjust andto refine our logistical anddiplomatic approaches on theground, not just in response tosupply chain challenges, but inanticipation of thesechallenges.
The aggressive approach that weare taking to expeditiouslybring home supplies means thatwe are building incontingencies, overbuying insome cases and implementingrigorous progress producttesting.
Progress is being made.
We have received six planeloadscarrying supplies from chinasince last Friday alone, andover 10 carriers have broughtgoods back to Canada overallfrom china.
They have helped to carrymillions n95 surgical masks andrespirators into Canada that arenow in the public health agencyfor testing.
I want to thank air Canada andcargo jet for continuing to stepup and deliver.
Last weekend we also received aninternational shipment of animportant base chemical neededfor producing re-agent as mycolleague Minister Bains mensedat luminutra.
That will allow for morecovid-19 testing.
The company is now gearing up todeliver re-agent for up to500, 000 tests on a weekly basis.
(voice of translator): imported products undergorigorous testing both at thesource and in Canada.
Where they are inspected by thepublic health agency of Canada.
The quality issues, whileunwelcome, are not unexpected, given the surge in global demandfor these goods.
[end of translation]supplies are not only comingfrom abroad but domesticproduction is ramping up andcanadian companies aredelivering.
I am pleased to announce with mycolleague Minister Bains thatthis week we have signedcontracts with three morecanadian companies, includingjacobs and thompson out of Toronto, windsor mold group outof windsor, Ontario, to producea total of 16 million medicalface shields.
The third company, canadianshield out of kitchener, hasmoved from 3d laser -- 3dprinting to laser cuttingtechnology to produce masks thatcan be easily be sanitized forre-use.
These are great examples ofcanadian ingenuity andimagination.
(voice of translator): I aminspired by the way that theseand other companies have risento the challenge and I am proudto say that we continue to addto our canadian lineup.
[end of translation]while the data may appearpromising in some parts of thecountry, models suggest thatthere may be future outbreaks, even after we get through thisfirst peak.
In terms of our procurements, this possibility means that weare still preparing for alleventualities.
In light of this reality, I ampleased to announce thatstriker, a company headquarteredin waterdown and with productionbased in quÉbec city, willprovide us with 82 sterilizationunits that have been approved byhealth Canada.
These machines allow for thesterilizing the equipment, inhealth care facilities acrossthe country.
(voice of translator): I ampleased to announced thatstriker, a company headquarteredin waterdown, and withproduction based in quÉbec city, will ship 82 sterilization unitsthat have been approved byhealth Canada.
These machines allow for thesterilization and the re-use ofequipment like n95 respirators.
Extending the life cycle of thisimportant piece of equipment inhealth care facilities acrossthe country.
We have also signed contracts tomeet the potential needs for upto 10 mobile health hubs.
These units, which are builtspecifically for providingrespiratory care, so that thelocal health authorities canaddress overflows of patients ifnecessary.
[end of translation]we hope that this surge capacitywill not be needed but we aretaking every precaution to keepcanadians safe.
The COVID-19 situation is veryworrying and stressful, andcanadians want to know what weare doing to protect them.
We are taking new steps to be astransparent as possible and tokeep Canadians up-to-date on ourwork.
Today we are launching an onlinereport detailing the progressthat we are making onprocuring --



**Rosemary**:

Okay, we're going to pull away from this federalbriefing.
The last few minutes we have heard about procurement and the new supply chain in Canada to make the much-needed P.P.E. and let's go to where ontariopremier Doug ford is making response to COVID-19 and his request to call in the military to help at long-term carecentres.
Here's the premier.



We're all paying a price, bu ti want you to know that yourefforts, that your collectiveefforts, are paying off.
We saw in this week's modeling that community spread is heading in the right direction.
That's because we're all doing our part.
People are staying home, self-isolating and ourbusinesses have stepped up in a big way.
Businesses across Ontario arepaying a heavy, heavy price toput their people and theircommunities first.
and our small and medium-sizedbusinesses are the backbone of our economy.
They're the cornerstone of ourcommunities, our restaurants, bars, our hospitality andtourism sector and our mom andpop shops that have been amongthe hardest hit.
and we all have to do everythingthat we can to support them.
We're allowing bars andrestaurants to sell alcohol withtheir delivery or takeoutorders.
We've delivered $10 billion intax deferrals wisb relief andother supports.
and we worked with the federalgovernment to provide loans andwage subsidies to help thesebusinesses stay afloat.
This is a strong start, but we can and we will do more.
We will leave nothing on thetable when it comes tosupporting Ontario through this, and today more help is here forour small businesses.
We're delivering emergencycommercial rent relief to ourontario small businesses andlandlords.
In total, over $900 million willgo towards helping thesebusinesses to make rent and keeppeople employed.
and I know that it's not justbusinesses paying rent, it'smany residential renters as well.
and with May 1 around thecorner, many tenants are feelinganxious about their rent rightnow.
I want to be very clear -- ifyou're working, if you have anincome, if you're able to, youmust pay rent.
But for the countless people outthere, for those who have hadtheir livelihoods impacted, forthe workers who have lost theirjobs, we will have your back.
We have frozen evictions so youwon't lose your home and today iwill ask the Prime Minister towork with us on a programme tosupport residential tenants.
I want to thank Minister clarkfor his work pushing the federalgovernment for residential rentrelief.
My friends, we're doingeverything in our power to helpontario adapt to the newreality.
and now we must begin the hardwork of recovery.
Early next week, we'll bereleasing our framework forre-opening Ontario's economy.
It will provide a gradual andmeasured approach to opening up. Let me be clear -- the healthand the safety of Ontario willalways come first.
I want to thank all of ourwonderful small businesses, ourcooks, cleaners and restaurantstaff, thank you to the peoplewho keep food on our tables.
Thank you to everyone who areputting others first by stayingat home.
We're working around the clockfor all of you.
We will get through thistogether and thank you and godbless the people of Ontario.
Now I'll invite ministerphillips up.



Thank you, premier ford, and good afternoon.
Under the leadership of premierford, Minister Elliott and minister Fulton, we have taken decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19. and so have the people ofontario.
Including the business community who have gone above and beyond to do their part.
But we know that some of the necessary measures put in place have come at a cost, especially for small and medium-sizedbusiness owners.
In particular, we've heard fromcommercial tenants and theirlandlords about the challengesfacing these businesses as theyexperience challenges payingtheir rent.
Support is urgently needed.
and that is why we're partneringwith the federal government todeliver the Ontario, canadaemergency commercial rentsupport programme.
Our government has committed $241 million to give much-neededrelief of more than $900 millionto Ontario business tenants andtheir landlords.
To receive the support, theywill need to reduce the rentalcost of a small business tenantfor 75% for April, may and unionand commit to a moratorium onevictions.
By providing support now we'llhelp small businesses to getthrough this challenging time sothey can be part of the recoverywhen the province reopens.
I'd like to thank the federalgovernment and Minister morneaufor joining us in this importantinvestment.
We have worked with the federalgovernment to bring commercialrent relief and when theystepped forward our governmentdidn't hesitate to partner in ameaningful way to providesupport for our small andmedium-sized businesses.
I will continue to urge myfederal colleagues to ensurethat rental relief arrives asquickly as possible.
It cannot come fast enough.
Today's commitment builds onontario's action plan respondingto COVID-19 which provided$17 billion in relief for peopleand employers.
As the premier mentioned itincludes $10 billion in cashflow support for businesses tokeep employees on the payrolland the lights on in theirbusinesses.
From eliminating the employerhealth tax for 90% ofbusinesses, to deferringpayments and interest onprovincial taxes, wisd premiumsand enabling property taxrelief.
The new Ontario jobs andrecovery committee have alreadystarted to plan for the nextphase.
Ontario's action plan isreopening our province.
This team will work together to get our economy moving againwith the focus on job creationand opportunities for growth andprotecting our province fromfuture threats.
I want to conclude byencouraging everyone to continueto follow the advice of ourpublic health officials.
As I've said before, I wasconfident in Ontario beforecovid-19, and I remain confidenttoday.
Thank you.



Well, before I takequestions, I just want to mention that at 1:00 we'll be joining the rest of the country in observing a moment of silence for the victims who lost their lives in the terrible tragedy in nova Scotia this past weekend.
My heartbreaks for the families and the loved ones, and I want them to know that you're all in our thoughts and our prayers during this extremely difficulttime.
We'll take questions now.



On the line, first question.



First question comes fromsingt ca mulligan from city news.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hello, premier.
I think that I'd like to start and I'm sure that I speak wit hall of the gallery where we offer you best wishes for your family after your news about your mother-in-law.



Well, thank you, thank you, Cynthia.

**Question**:

I have a question for the health Minister, please.
Minister, we know that thousands of surgeries have been cancelled in the last month, 1, 700 cancersurgeries, for example, and thousands of other types ofsurgeries.
I know that you're talking about getting this back online, bu tare you worried that there will be a lot of collateral damage to people that don't have COVID-19, but will still suffer the healthconsequences?



Well, I know that there are many people who are waiting to have surgeries performed from orthopedic surgeries to morepressing, the cancer surgeries.
I know this is anxiety provoking for many people.
They're worried about their own health and safety.
But the decisions were ma debased on a pandemic plan that was developed by cancer careontario.
So those are the cases.
However, I would say that we are going to be returning to as soon as we're able to start resuming elective surgeries once again.
But because we're still in the peak of COVID-19, we still are getting numbers in over 500, in some cases over 600 in a dailybasis.
But we need to make sure thatwe're past the peak so we will know that we'll have the hospital capacity that we nee din order to get back to thesesurgeries.
But we are planning for them already and as soon as the chief medical officer of health gives us the indication that the peak has passed, that we will be starting those surgeries againimmediately.

---

**Question**:

Do you have timeline for that, is that possibly weeks? and I know how incredibly busy you are and focused on COVID-19, but are there things that youhaven't been able to get to that are falling through the cracks? for example, cystic fibrosispatients.
Before this all hit they were begging for a new medication that could be potentially belife-saving and yet they are soincredibly vulnerable tocovid-19. Have you been able to push thatforward at all?



We are continuing to work on all of the other files that are important in health.
I think that with the cystic fibrosis medication that is something that several of themhaven't been passed through health Canada as yet.
and so things have been slowed down as you -- I'm sure that you can understand because ofcovid-19. But we are still continuing thatwork.
and that is -- it's very busy with the COVID-19 issues, but the other issues that are important to people as well.
So we're continuing to work on them and when the chief medical officer of health tells us that the peak has passed we'll be able to resume many issues, including the elective surgeries and including the work on some of these other important files as well.



Next question.



Next question is coming fromalison Jones from the canadianpress.
Please, go ahead.

**Question**:

Hi, premier.
On the commercial rent reliefprogramme, the canadianfederation of independent businesses are raising concerns that the programme is too reliant on landlords, that it will go through them rather than the businesses themselves that need help.
How did you and in consultation with the federal government make the decision to make it operate this way?



Well, I'll pass this over to the Minister of finance and he'shandling that file.
Thank you.



Thanks very much for thatquestion.
and we have been in frequent contact with Dan Kelly at thecfib.
and the programme design certainly took into accountmany, many of the considerations that cifb and small business owners across Ontario and canadahad in place.
The important part of partnering with the landlords is that we are expecting them as part of the programme to take 25% off of that rent.
So they're an important partner in this.
and it also ensures that we can cover the broad swath ofbusinesses.
Because almost everyone has alandlord.
So the structure of theprogramme was meant to make sure that in our case that we thank there will be hundreds of thousands of businesses inontario that will be able to take advantage of this.
and it was also meant to ensure that everybody did their part.
There's an expectation that the small businesses will pay 25% of what they would have beenpaying, and that the landlord will be getting a substantialcomponent, 75% of theirexpectation.
But this was designed to be able to be implemented quickly andthat's why we used -- sorry --the Canada mortgage and housingorginisation as part of this.
and they have 98% of the landlords already.
So very much designed to be comprehensive and to be able to cover the majority of the businesses that we're targeting.
and that the money could be delivered quickly.



Thank you.
and for -- I guess either the premier or either of the ministers on the militaryassistance, for the five priority long-term care homes, what is the criteria used todecide which five homes todeploy to first.
Some of them are, obviously, noteven close to the hardest hit interms of the numbers of deaths.



Thank you for the question.
So we have really been monitoring very carefully the status of all of our homes and looking at who is in greatestneed.
The staffing appears to be the main area of severe concern right now.
and that is a major part of howwe've determined to go with these five homes.
But this is an issue that ischanging.
and so if other areas, otherhomes, need assistance in thisregard, more will be deployed.

**Question**:

Hi, premier.
We've learned that fiat Chrysler's looking to restart production in the United States and Canada, including the one in Brampton on may fourth.
Now we just wanted to know how much consultation was done with your government and why this date was selected? because employees and their union have expressed grave concerns about this early start with their health and safety.
So what can you say to calm those concerns?



Well, I guess that's with the automotive industry right across north America is open and we have been consulting with the parts manufacturers, along with the automotive manufacturersthemselves.
I just got off the phone yesterday with the president oftoyota as well and the supply chain won't move forward without the support of their region and north America.
I have full confidence in the --first of all, the unions and thenon-union automotive partmanufacturers and the actualauto manufacturers themselves.
They're very, very responsibleorginisations.
They aren't going to jeopardizeanything when it comes to healthand safety and I have heard thatright from the president and thec.
E.o. Of many companies.
They're going to make sure thatthey practise social distancingand they have proper P.P.E. Equipment for all of theiremployees.
and I've been through a majorityof all of the plants.
They're very, very clean, wellorganized and nothing is moreimportant to these companiesthan the health and thewell-being of their employees.
and I know that they're incommunications with theirunions.
So I'm sure that they'll be ableto work things out and to have avery safe working environment.

---

**Question**:

and, premier, we hear you every day speaking about -- just now the health of the employees and the health of people of this province.
and we want to know how you'redoing.
You're working day and night andthere's so much pressure on yourshoulders.
You have expressed that yourmother-in-law has testedpositive.
So how are you caring foryourself mentally andphysically?



Well, I appreciate it. I'm fine.
I feel, you know, knock on wood, healthy as a horse right now.
and it's not about our family.
It's about the 78, 000 families in long-term care and what theydeal with day in and day out.
It's about families that areworried about rent on May 1 andthat have lost their jobs, sometimes there's a couple, bothof them, who have lost theirjobs.
and they have three kids.
That's what you call pressure.
When you can't meet a mortgage, you know, or finding it tough toput food on the table.
But I appreciate it. But, believe me, it's all about the families and it's aboutfrontline health care workersover at west park and everyother long-term care facilitythat are risking everythinggoing in there and day in andday out.
and that's all I think about allday, all night, is how we'regoing to get through this andhow we'll support the people ofontario.
As premier that's My job toprotect every single person, tomake sure that I advocate to thefederal government and push thefederal government, forinstance, on rent.
You know, rent alone -- we'redoing it with businesses.
Now we need to do it with thetenants and the landlords fortheir residents.
and the landlords, a lot of themaren't big landlords and they'rejust hard-working people thatmight have a couple units andthey're trying to survive.
and I want to -- I want tothanks, you know, the federalgovernment for all of theirhelp.
They've been great, by the way, absolutely fabulous.
But we need more.
We need more for residentialrent.
I know that the prime ministermentioned about long-term careyesterday and the military.
I need his help.
Prime Minister, if you'relistening, I need your help onlong-term care.
We need funding.
and if you can provide fundingthat would help us to getthrough this and to have abetter, more sustainablelong-term care facilities.
So that's all that's on My mind.
24/7, literally, 24/7. But thank you, thank you so muchfor asking.



Next question.



Next question comes from mikecrawley at CBC news.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hi, premier.
Just to pick up on long-termcare and your requests to theprime Minister.
On the funding side of thingsyou have mentioned previouslyabout the possibility of toppingup the pay of long-term careworkers.
I guess in particular personalsupport workers.
Any sense of when that's goingto happen, how much it's goingto be? because, you know, we have beenhearing reports that personalsupport workers are leaving togo to other minimum wage jobsbecause they wouldn't have toput their lives on the line.



We'll take care of them, mike and nothing is a tougher job than what they're facing rightnow.
Just imagine having a loved one, a husband, a wife, a brother Ora sister, you know, that has Togo into this job every singleday.
They're absolute hero's and want to just tell them that help is on the way.
Our Minister of finance is working on a programme rightnow.
and along with the help of the federal government and that will be released very shortly.

**Question**:

One more follow-up, premier.
When you look at starting toease some of the restrictions, maybe allowing somenon-essential businesses tostarting to open, have you givenany thought to whether thephase-in might happendifferently in different partsof Ontario? because it seems that thepandemic isn't having the samelevel of impact in northernontario as it is in southernontario and people in the northare wondering why the samesolutions need to be imposednecessarily on them when, youknow, life in the north is somuch different.
So is there a possibility ofsome sort of slightly differentregional phase-ins of looking atrestrictions?



Yeah, great, great question, mike.
We're dealing with almost two different worlds.
You have the urban and you have the rural areas.
But we're all connected.
The problem with that, mike, and fully understand what you'resaying and I actually agree with what you're saying, we justcan't -- we just can't risk, youknow, someone in Toronto going up north.
But what I'm going to do is to pass this over to the minister of finance and he's putting package together.
Thank you.



Thank you, mike.
So the premier mentioned that we will be releasing ministerelliott and the premier and myself the framework that will speak to those very questions.
But as the premier touched on, obviously, we are experiencing in the suburban and the urban areas different realities of community transmission than they are in some of the more ruralareas.
The considerations are absolutely the movement of people and the fact that people could move.
and, in fact, may be invented to move from one area to another based on differential restrictions in some of thoseareas.
But this is absolutely, youknow, what the framework isconsidering.
We're getting the very best science advice and you will see that I think that saskatchewanto their credit, they are further ahead in terms of theircovid issues.
They released a document that this is an issue that all of the provinces are going to be need to be considering because of the nature of the size and the scope of our provinces.
I should mention as well, ofcourse, that you open up issues around cross border.
We're in conversations andthere's two clusters of americanstates in the new York related cluster and a Michigan and amid western cluster and so these are all part of the complex considerations that are part of the framework that comestogether.
But as always I have to end my saying that it will be based on the best health and science advice and making sure that we protect the safety of ontarioworkers.
and I should mention that the premier mentioned about fiatchrysler and that conversation before and our work by the minister of labour and the skills and labour, and designing the sort of skilled -- or the safe workplace requirements and expectations with our healthprofessionals.
So that the workplaces will have the sort of guidance that they need to open up safely, whether for the workers or customers in some settings, thank you.



Next question.



Next question from carmendemelloc from CTV news.

**Question**:

a question with the premier and the finance minister about the framework coming up next week.
How closely are you going to be watching Saskatchewan's rolloutof their, you know, restarting of the economy? and could Ontario have a similar kind of five-step plan just likesaskatchewan had?



Well, as we have been saying, Colin, the first priority is making sure that we protect the health and well-being of thepeople of Ontario.
and as you know thatsaskatchewan has such a much, much, much smaller populationand a large area.
a lot of farming communities as well in Saskatchewan.
and I've gotta tell you that ithink of world of premier scottmoe.
He's one of the champions of all of the premiers.
We get along very well.
But we also look at other modelsright across the province.
and actually we look at modelsright around the world to seewhat's working and what's notworking and take the best ideasoff of them.

**Question**:

Okay, premier, quÉbec has asked for a thousand more members of the canadianarmed forces to come in to help to shore up the support they already had.
and so I know that Ontario has250 now.
Could there be a possibility that Ontario would need mo remembers of the military to come in to help more beleagueredlong-term care homes as we are, you know, continuing to gothrough this crisis?



Yeah, I had a good conversation with premierlegault last night.
and, boy, they're in tough, tough haul over in quÉbec rightnow.
and we just shared advice back and forth.
But right now we've asked the hospitals to get involved, the public health to be involved, the volunteers, retired nurses, to come back and as well as themilitary.
But we had a good conversation today with the long-term careand the plan moving forward.
We have a solid plan.
So right now, colin, to answeryour question -- we're allright.
and I'm so grateful for the --you know, for the military.
These people are incredible.
and I mentioned it yesterday butwhen general vance said, premier, send me to the toughestplaces that you have, they'reincredible, they're heroes, ourmen and women who are part of our military, absolutelyamazing.
So we welcome them with openarms.
and I just want to wish franÇoislegault all of the best inquÉbec.
We think that we have a toughtime here, it's a lot tougher inquÉbec.
and he needs the resources.
and, again, I'm going to repeatmy request to the prime ministerthat both premier legault andmyself will ask the Prime Minister for support inlong-term care.
We all agree, you know, themilitary shouldn't be theirfull-time job on this end, butwe need funding off the federalgovernment.
and, again, I want to thank thefederal government, we're sograteful for all of the fundingthat they have given us so far.
They've been true partners.
So thank you.



Next question.



Next question comes --



**Rosemary**:

We'll pull away--



Please go ahead.



**Rosemary**:

Let me bring you up to date on a couple of issues that the premier highlightedthere.
There's now five long-term carecentres in Ontario where 250canadian soldiers will behelping in some of thehardest-hit long-term carecentres.
The premier also talked about aplea that he plans to make, well, he did make it publicly, but he'll make on the phone inabout an hour's time to theprime Minister about residentialrelief -- rent relief -- whichhas already happened andannounced today on thecommercial front by the Prime Minister.
But the premier is saying thatresidential rent is also anissue.
and, finally, Ontario says thatlike other provinces that nextweek it will announce a plan tobegin easing some restrictions.
That, of course, will be phasedin over time and there were nodates given.
But they plan to start outlininghow that might happen next week.
and that too will be a point ofconversation between the Prime Minister and premiers who arespeaking at 2:00 eastern for acouple hours.
Not only about re-opening theeconomies and how you coordinatethat across the country, butalso about essential workers.
While they did reach thisagreement on commercial renttoday, there is still theongoing issue of how to betterhelp to support financiallyessential workers in thiscountry and the provinces arevery much interested in someadditional financial aid fromthe federal government on thatfront as well.
and on that note I think that iwill leave it there.
But let me tell youneedwe are expecting that premiers' call at 2:00, later today andwe'll keep you up-to-date on theupdates across the country onhow your province might behandling all ON this.
and I'll remind you that theother story that we're trackingtoday is the ongoing informationthat we got from the rcmpearlier today, some reallyhorrifying details about howthose hours played out thisweekend in Nova Scotia.
I know that lots of people, Andrew, are going to be thinkingabout the victims who are lostand I'll pass it over to Andrew.
[please stand by]
