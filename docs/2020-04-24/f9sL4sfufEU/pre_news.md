I know you have heard from people as have I, that it was one thing to get access to a loan, but if you had to pay tens of thousands of dollars in rent, you would be in trouble.

We're expecting from the Prime Minister an announcement on rent relief directed thru the Prime Minister, funneled eventually through the provinces that have jurisdiction.
It will be in the form of a loan to commercial property owners who will have to offer rent relief to small businesses.
Time is important here.
May 1 is coming up, April 1 has passed, and in the interim we are looking forward to hearing from small businesses.



**Rosemary**:

Now the Prime Minister of Canada.
