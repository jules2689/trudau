### Summary:

 eastern a virtual vigil will be held to remember those taken too soon and to support friends and family.
Let's come together to support these communities who suffered immeasurable loss.
This will be an opportunity for us to show the family and friends of the victims that we are there to support them.


[end of translation] at the beginning of the outbreak our government has been working withprovincial and territorial partners to not only get throughthis, but to position the economy to rebound once this is over.
a big part of this work is listening to Canadians and making adjustments as we go along.
One thing we've heard is small businesses are having trouble making rent because of COVID-19. If you've had to close up shop because of public health recommendations, if you don't have a lot of money coming in because people aren't spending much these days, you may be worried about losing your officespace or not having a coffee shop to reopen after this crisis.
We are introducing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance plan.
Today I can announce that we've reached agreements with all provinces and territories to lower rent by 75% for small businesses that have been strongly affected by COVID-19 for April, may, and June.
If you are a small business thathas been strongly affected by COVID-19 and you're paying less than $50, 000 per month on rent, you'll be eligible to receive this support.
We will have more to say about rent support for larger businesses in the coming days.
 

[voice of interpreter] last week I announced our intention of introducing the quae emergency commercial rent assistance program.
Today I am able to confirm that we have reached agreements with all the provinces and territories to lower rent by 75%for small- and medium-sized businesses that have been hard hit by COVID-19 for the months of April, may, and June.
This support will be able to small businesses hard hit by COVID-19 and whose monthly rent is less than $50, 000.
Later today I will be talking to the premiers of the provinces and territories.
That means that we have to adjust our response to the reality of each province and territory.
But reopening the economy, whatever provinces and territories are concerned, will have to happen gradually to ensure the progress that has been achieved will not be lost, there must be significant coordination at the national level.
So we will be working with provincial and territorial governments and establish recommendations that ensure the safety of Canadians.
If you see one province is goingto relax its rules, you must still continue to follow the rules in place where you live, otherwise there is a real risk we will lose everything we've done thus far.
The reconnaissance work is underway in those two provinces and we are now identifying the work to be done and the next steps.
We are deploying the army to provide urgent assistance and help the provinces to take control of the situation.
We have also given millions of dollars to the provinces to beefup salaries so the seniors receive the care they deserve.
Our government will be there to help the provinces.
Members of the canadian armed forces will be deployed after the Minister of public safety received and approved two formalrequests from Ontario and qu√âbec.
Reconnaissance work is underway in both provinces.
We're deploying the military to provide emergency support to help provinces regain control ofthe situation, but we all know that this is only a short-term solution.
We're also offering billions of dollars to provinces to top up the pay of essential workers andmake sure elderly Canadians get the support they deserve.
Later today I will be meeting with the first ministers to continue our work on supporting Canadians during this time.
It will require a lot of coordination at the national level and our government will bethere to do that work.
We will be working with the provinces and territories to establish principles and guidelines to start reopening the economy safely.
