[end of translation] at the beginning of the outbreak our government has been working withprovincial and territorial partners to not only get throughthis, but to position the economy to rebound once this is over.
a big part of this work is listening to Canadians and making adjustments as we go along.
One thing we've heard is small businesses are having trouble making rent because of COVID-19. If you've had to close up shop because of public health recommendations, if you don't have a lot of money coming in because people aren't spending much these days, you may be worried about losing your officespace or not having a coffee shop to reopen after this crisis.
We are introducing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance plan.
Today I can announce that we've reached agreements with all provinces and territories to lower rent by 75% for small businesses that have been strongly affected by COVID-19 for April, may, and June.
The government will cover 50% ofthat reduction with the propertyowner covering the rest.
If you are a small business thathas been strongly affected by COVID-19 and you're paying less than $50, 000 per month on rent, you'll be eligible to receive this support.
You will also be there for non-profits and charitable organizations struggling.
We will have more to say about rent support for larger businesses in the coming days.
 

[voice of interpreter] last week I announced our intention of introducing the quae emergency commercial rent assistance program.
Today I am able to confirm that we have reached agreements with all the provinces and territories to lower rent by 75%for small- and medium-sized businesses that have been hard hit by COVID-19 for the months of April, may, and June.
The government will cover 50% ofthat reduction, whereas the owner will cover the rest.
This support will be able to small businesses hard hit by COVID-19 and whose monthly rent is less than $50, 000.
Charities and non-profit organizations will also be eligible under the program and later we will have news for larger corporations.
Later today I will be talking to the premiers of the provinces and territories.
We have a number of things on the agenda.
For one thing, we will be continuing our conversation on the gradual reopening of the economy.
Canada is a huge country and it's clear that the pandemic hasnot hit each region the same way.
We are a federation.
That means that we have to adjust our response to the reality of each province and territory.
But reopening the economy, whatever provinces and territories are concerned, will have to happen gradually to ensure the progress that has been achieved will not be lost, there must be significant coordination at the national level.
So we will be working with provincial and territorial governments and establish recommendations that ensure the safety of Canadians.
I want to be clear when it comesto reopening the economy, that will not happen overnight.
It has to be done one step at a time.
If you do not want us to start from scratch, every single person must continue to be vigilant and to follow public health recommendations.
From the beginning of this crisis, we have been seeing whathas been happening in singapore and japan and south korea.
In some places we have seen the challenges associated with reopening the economy, so we must be very, very careful.
Every place must have a separateapproach.
If you see one province is goingto relax its rules, you must still continue to follow the rules in place where you live, otherwise there is a real risk we will lose everything we've done thus far.
As I said yesterday, we are witnessing troubling scenes in seniors' homes and long-term care facilities right across thecountry.
That is unacceptable and our government will be there to help.
Members of the canadian armed forces will be deployed following an official request from Ontario and quÉbec.
and the Minister of public safety has accepted those requests.
The reconnaissance work is underway in those two provinces and we are now identifying the work to be done and the next steps.
Ontarians and quÉbecers and all Canadians can count on us in this crisis.
We are deploying the army to provide urgent assistance and help the provinces to take control of the situation.
We know that that's not a long-term solution.
We have also given millions of dollars to the provinces to beefup salaries so the seniors receive the care they deserve.


[end of translation] what we're witnessing in long-term care facilities across the country isextremely troubling.
It's unacceptable.
Our government will be there to help the provinces.
Members of the canadian armed forces will be deployed after the Minister of public safety received and approved two formalrequests from Ontario and quÉbec.
Reconnaissance work is underway in both provinces.
We're identifying what needs to be done and mapping out next steps.
As I said many times before, we will be there for quÉbecers, ontarians, and all Canadians during this crisis.
We're deploying the military to provide emergency support to help provinces regain control ofthe situation, but we all know that this is only a short-term solution.
We're also offering billions of dollars to provinces to top up the pay of essential workers andmake sure elderly Canadians get the support they deserve.
Later today I will be meeting with the first ministers to continue our work on supporting Canadians during this time.
We're also going to talk about reopening parts of the economy.
Canada is a vast country, and some regions have been hit harder than others during this pandemic.
We're a federation so we have toadapt our response to the realities and challenges of eachprovince and territory.
But I want to be clear that getting back to normal will not happen overnight.
It's going to take time.
It won't be as simple or easy asflipping a switch.
It will require a lot of coordination at the national level and our government will bethere to do that work.
We will be working with the provinces and territories to establish principles and guidelines to start reopening the economy safely.
Over the coming weeks, you'll hear more talk about reopening, but you need to know, we're not out of the woods.
It's absolutely critical that everyone continues to follow local public health instructionsas we move forward.
For now, these instructions are the same for all Canadians.
No matter where you live, you should be staying home as much as you possibly can.
You should be washing your handsregularly.
You should always keep a safe distance of 2 metres from others.
That is the only way for us to make it through together.
