### Summary:



Whether you mark good Friday or Passover, Easter, tamely new year or visake, usually this is a time we spend together.
Last year, when I served a community lunch in Hamilton, I saw just how much people come together over these next few days.
The Easter bunny has a big job to do this year and maybe there is something you can do to help.
They need a lot of energy to keep us all safe and this is how you can help them to do their job.
If you've lost your job and are having troubles making ends meet, you can apply for the Canada emergency response benefit.
Remember, you can apply today or this weekend if you haven't done so yet by going to Canada.
If you own a small business or struggling to pay the bells or pay your staff, we launched the Canada emergency business account yesterday.
Tomorrow, we're bringing back the house of commons to pass the largest economic measures Canada has seen since world war ii. It's really important, despite a time of crisis, in fact because of a time of crisis that our institutions remain strong and our democratic principles continue.
Therefore, this address to Canadians tomorrow will be a little later and from the floor of the house of commons.
But I'll be back Tuesday with more updates on how we're helping you.
If you just feel overwhelmed, we'll soon have more to say about how you can access resources that can help.
To ensure that Canadians are safe and our frontline workers have the support they need, we're helping Canadians join in the effort.
We've invested in this large-scale production as part of our plan to have enough vital supplies produced right here at home.
When Canadians work together, we get things done.
