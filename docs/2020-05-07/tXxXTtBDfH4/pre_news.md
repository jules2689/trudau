# News before the Speech



We are standing by for Justin trudeau's address on the COVID-19 response.
Expected to start a little earlier today, probably in the next minute or so. In his usual location, back to his usual location today, just outside his home at Rideau cottage, and we are also expecting him today to talk about a federal-provincial agreement that has been negotiated for a number of weeksnow to try and find a way to topup wages for essential workers, and those can be essential workers at long-term care homes or essential workers in any other part of the economy where people might be going to work inspite of the preponderance -- pandemic.
Finding ways to increase their salaries, to thank them for the work they are doing and to keep them in those jobs.
Specifically the Prime Minister has talked about the people making less than $2500 a month, and yes, that would, of course, also apply to long-term care homes.
Care homes really as we've been talking about since the beginning of this, the epicentreof the pandemic here in Canada where the vast majority of Canadians have died, and that isparticularly in Quebec, and Ontario just earlier today the Minister of national defence talked about the number of soldiers now deployed into long-term care homes in both Ontario and Quebec, more than a thousand of them in some 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and five here in Ontario.
This is, again, an agreement that has been reached between the federal government and provinces.
From what we understand, it willbe a fairly flexible deal, allowing provinces to decide just who is an essential worker and who will need this kind of benefit, wage top-up, if you will.
and here now, the prime ministerof Canada with more details for us.
