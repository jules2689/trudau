# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to begin with a few words about the terrible helicopter crash that claimed the lives of six armed forces members last week.
Yesterday I attended a ceremony in their honour.
I was grateful to have an opportunity to pay My respects.
I got to speak with mothers, fathers and stepfathers, grandparents, friends, sons and daughters, fiancees, partners and loved ones.
All of them were heartbroken.
All of them were also immensely proud of the life of service chosen by their loved one, as are we all.
We will never forget their service.
They will live on in our hearts, and I know the thoughts of all Canadians are with the families and loved ones who were going through an incredibly difficult time.
We stand with them and we will continue to stand with them.
As time and time again members of the Canadian armed forces step up to help those in need, whether it be as a part of a NATO mission in Europe or in the wake of a natural disaster here in Canada, they are always therefor us, eager to help, ready to serve, and this pandemic is no exception.
When our government received requests for assistance from Ontario and Quebec, our men and women in uniform once again answered the call.
In Ontario, 265 cafe members have now been deployed to five long-term care facilities.
They are supporting our front-line workers, caring for our parents and grandparents, and bringing some comfort to thefamilies.
If you've lost a loved one in one of those facilities, or if you have a loved one you haven'tbeen able to visit for weeks, you're worried sick about what tomorrow will bring and you hopethat they are getting the care they deserve, seeing our caf members offer their help and talents during these times is a reassuring sight for many of these families, so I want to thank all of those who have beendeployed and all the front-line workers who continue to work harder than ever to keep our seniors safe.
[voice of interpreter]across the country, about 1200 canadian rangers have been deployed to provide assistance in order to limit the spread of virus to a number of regions, including 200 rangers to nunavutand to the lower north shore, and across Quebec there are now more than 670 caf personnel in 20 long-term care homes with 350additional members to provide support.
We expect that next week there will be a total of 1350 militarypersonnel as part of that operation to provide support in 25 facilities.
Long-term care homes are the facilities that have been hardest hit by COVID-19, and ourmembers are there to provide assistance.
They are now looking after our parents and our grandparents.
They are supporting the people who are there, including nurses and front-line workers who are working very long hours in very, very difficult conditions.
So I want to take a moment to thank all our military personnelthat have stepped up to lend a hand.
I also want to recognize the incredible work that our front-line workers have been carrying out since the beginningof this crisis.
Not only in long-term care homesbut elsewhere.
You are a source of motivation for all of us. You're looking after our parents.
You're looking after the ill, and you're taking care of us. You are fighting the good fight against COVID-19, and have been since the beginning of this crisis.
and you deserve more than just our gratitude.
You deserve to be properly paid for the essential work that you are doing.
Today I AM able to announce thatwe have reached an agreement with all the provinces and territories with a view to topping up the wages of essential workers.
We are now finalizing the details with some provinces, buti want to point out that this isa joint effort.
All the premiers agree we must support our essential workers.
I want to thank them for having shown a team spirit in addressing this issue.
Now more than ever we need thoseworkers, and we will be there for them.
The governments of the provincesand territories will determine exactly which workers will receive the wage top-up, but this is what we're going to do. If you are risking your health in order to get through this crisis and you are receiving minimum wage, you deserve to earn more.
[ end of interpretation ]today I can announce that we have an agreement with all the provinces and territories to provide a wage top-up for essential workers, for canadianswho are willing called to go to work every day, for Canadians who are providing us with essential services so we can continue to keep our families safe and healthy.
Right now we're finalizing the details with the last provinces, and I want to underscore that this has been a truly collaborative effort.
Premiers from across the countryall agree that we need to support our essential workers, and I thank the premiers for thecontinued team Canada approach.
We are relying on these workers now more than ever, and we will be there to support them.
It will be up to each province and territory to determine who exactly qualifies for this wage increase, but the bottom line isthis: if you're risking your health to keep this country moving and you're making minimumwage, you deserve a raise.
I want to close by noting that today buddhists in Canada and around the world will mark theirmost important festival.
While this year's celebrations will be a bit different, the buddha's message of peace, selfless service and compassion to those in need is more important than ever.
I want to wish a happy and peaceful vesak to all those celebrating.
I'm now happy to take people's questions.
