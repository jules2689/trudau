### Summary:


In Ontario, 265 cafe members have now been deployed to five long-term care facilities.
They are supporting our front-line workers, caring for our parents and grandparents, and bringing some comfort to thefamilies.
If you've lost a loved one in one of those facilities, or if you have a loved one you haven'tbeen able to visit for weeks, you're worried sick about what tomorrow will bring and you hopethat they are getting the care they deserve, seeing our caf members offer their help and talents during these times is a reassuring sight for many of these families, so I want to thank all of those who have beendeployed and all the front-line workers who continue to work harder than ever to keep our seniors safe.
[voice of interpreter]across the country, about 1200 canadian rangers have been deployed to provide assistance in order to limit the spread of virus to a number of regions, including 200 rangers to nunavutand to the lower north shore, and across Quebec there are now more than 670 caf personnel in 20 long-term care homes with 350additional members to provide support.
Long-term care homes are the facilities that have been hardest hit by COVID-19, and ourmembers are there to provide assistance.
They are supporting the people who are there, including nurses and front-line workers who are working very long hours in very, very difficult conditions.
I also want to recognize the incredible work that our front-line workers have been carrying out since the beginningof this crisis.
You deserve to be properly paid for the essential work that you are doing.
Today I AM able to announce thatwe have reached an agreement with all the provinces and territories with a view to topping up the wages of essential workers.
All the premiers agree we must support our essential workers.
The governments of the provincesand territories will determine exactly which workers will receive the wage top-up, but this is what we're going to do. If you are risking your health in order to get through this crisis and you are receiving minimum wage, you deserve to earn more.
[ end of interpretation ]today I can announce that we have an agreement with all the provinces and territories to provide a wage top-up for essential workers, for canadianswho are willing called to go to work every day, for Canadians who are providing us with essential services so we can continue to keep our families safe and healthy.
Premiers from across the countryall agree that we need to support our essential workers, and I thank the premiers for thecontinued team Canada approach.
We are relying on these workers now more than ever, and we will be there to support them.
It will be up to each province and territory to determine who exactly qualifies for this wage increase, but the bottom line isthis: if you're risking your health to keep this country moving and you're making minimumwage, you deserve a raise.
