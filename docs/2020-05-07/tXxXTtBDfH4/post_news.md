# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

All right, this is the Prime Minister of Canada giving us his daily briefing on how his government is responding to the pandemic.
In about half an hour's time he will appear in front of the COVID-19 committee, the virtual committee, and is expected to answer some questions there.
We will bring you some of that as well.
Today an announcement that the federal government has reached an agreement with provinces and territories, a cost-sharing agreement to bump up wages for quote unquote essential workers in this country.
$3 billion coming from ottawa tomake that happen, and another billion expected to be put on the table by the provinces.
Let's bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos, and the cbc's catherine cullen, both here listening with me. So this is very significant.
Vassy, I know you've been tracking it closely, because it was not necessarily the easiest negotiation between the provinces to get to this point.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, no, not at all, Rosie, and it took a number of weeks for those negotiations to end up where they are today, and that is, as you mentioned, with an agreement in principle.
I would note that some of the details it sounds like the Prime Minister said with some provinces, there are a few I guess left in which the details have to be worked out, but the agreement in principle is there.
The price tag is a big one.
As you mentioned, $3 billion.
The Prime Minister says provinces will contribute a billion additional dollars to that.
a lot of questions remain, though, about how exactly that will work.
It's largely a function of the fact that most of that will be up to the province itself.
So for example, who is deemed an essential worker, that will be up to the province.
and then the way in which the money -- I guess the amount of the top-up, and that was a bit confusing to me, because the announcement of the program initially from the Prime Minister was that anyone who makes under $2500 would get somesort of a top-up. I know from speaking with various premiers that there wereconcerns at that point about a lack of flexibility.
So for example, in Nova Scotia, essential workers there the premier said already made that amount of money, so they didn't want to not qualify for it. I think the follow-up questions should be directed definitely atthe provinces, who exactly will get this in your province and how much will they get.
How will they have to qualify for it. I thought the question also to the Prime Minister about, like, what kind of strings.
I'm paraphrasing, but what kind of strings are attached to this.
is there a basic level that provinces or set of requirementsthat provinces have to meet in order to qualify for that money.
He didn't really give a specificanswer, so I AM sort of looking for the devil in the details.
is it just sort of a handover ofmoney? will provinces have full jurisdiction over those decisions or will there be some sort of parameters set by the federal government? I imagine there will be some, but definitely that's where I'm interested going forward.
Just quickly before I turn it back to you, the other thing that really stood out to me was jumping off a conversation, political conversation yesterday, elizabeth may, leaderof the green party -- or former leader of the green party.
and yves-franÇois blanchet, the leader of the bloc quÉbÉcois, both coming out and saying oil is dead, the oil sands are over.
The Prime Minister really rebuked that statement today I thought, which was very interesting, and sort of set some groundwork I think for whatmay be additional help for the oil sector.
Though the sector is anxious to hear what that help might be, and certainly politicians out west have been saying, hey, where is this extra stuff you'vebeen promising now since the endof March.
It did sound like the Prime Minister was not holding back atall from the potential for that.
and he certainly said very unequivocally that he disagreed with the assessment put forward before those other politicians.



**Rosemary**:

I will also say that the provinces, back to the top-up issue, is provinces have actually done a bit of that workon their own.
My producer phil put together a handy list for me. Quebec has done that, Ontario has done it. Saskatchewan, Alberta.
But this is all concentrated on long-term care workers, and I think, Vassy, all your questionsto the provinces will be interesting.
Catherine, this money could go to anyone they deem to be an essential worker who's not getting paid enough, and it's potentially, you know, putting their health at risk by going towork every day.



Yeah, I thought some of the most poignant questions during this q&a had to do with the vulnerability of those who will be receiving this money.
Not only has this highlighted the fact that these people in these long-term care centres, our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, that they are vulnerable, but also the people caring for them are vulnerable as well, and I think it's been acknowledged that this is a situation that needs to be looked at well beyond the scope of this pandemic.
I think if you just take a step back at both of the announcements -- looking at bothof the announcements today, bothwhat the Prime Minister announced and the announcement of earlier today that members ofthe canadian forces, a greater number are going to be in long-term care facilities in Quebec.
Also members of the canadian forces at long-term care facilities in Ontario.
I think it once again underlines, points out the fragility of this system.
The Prime Minister said a few weeks ago that this whole thing was, to some extent, it points to a failure, right? soldiers shouldn't be taking care of our seniors, and I thinkeverything we're seeing today, it is being celebrated as a teamcanada effort.
Everyone coming together on these negotiations, but we all also I think have to keep in mind the fact that there is a very big problem here on many fronts, not only the people working in these facilities, butof course the incredible number of deaths that we're seeing in all of them, and a great deal more work than this is going to be needed to address that.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, I should say in Quebec they gave a $4 per hour pay hike for workers in private long-term care homes, but to give you a sense of what they are actually making, it's about $24 an hour to attract newworkers, and given the amount ofwork that they are having to do and because there are not enoughpeople, so the number of patients and people they are caring for, you could argue that's still not enough.
I thought too the prime ministerhad some interesting things to say about how this pandemic has exposed the way we treat the people that we rely on every single day, maybe without alwaysrealizing, you know, how much werely on them.
There will be questions, though, about not only how the provincesdo this, Vassy, but also then a little bit like the Andrew Scheer conversation around CERB, how it gets pulled back.
Because if in -- you know, however long the program lasts, let's say four months, how do you then go back to paying someone who you've prioritized as an essential worker, you've said deserves more than minimum wage, and now we turn the corneron the pandemic and suddenly this person is expected to existon a lower salary? I just wonder if it's going to lead to a bigger conversation about how people are paid in this country, and maybe for better even.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I think that that conversation is happening, and it will persist well after this is done for sure.
I think there's two parts to that question.
The first is, so what do they do with the actual program and is that going to be left up to provinces as well? how will that relationship move going forward, and what happens? just like as you said with the CERB or the wage subsidy program, I mean, these are big decisions that governments are going to have to make pretty shortly, actually.
The second part of it is not just around I think, you know, the wage itself, but I understand that the money is funnelled through to people who work in these scenarios in grocery stores or in long-term care homes, but I think part of that conversation that will exist after this is to -- you know, the fact that the federal government here and provincial governments are essentially having to pay workers in privately-run places, whether itbe a grocery store, whether it be a long-term care home, I think there are some, you know, difficult questions, maybe even now, for -- that taxpayers may have.
These people deserve more money, certainly, and I know that market conditions are different depending on the business, but you know, it is interesting thatwe're using tax money to pay people more in a privately run home and there are so many questions in the way which thosehomes are being run by those private companies and if, in fact, those companies are takinghome huge profits, and I'm not saying all of them are, but if they are, you have to wonder whythey are not paying their employees more as well.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, I will leave it there with both of you just for a moment, if you don't mind, Vassy and Catherine, to bring in another voice, a family medicine resident with the university of Toronto, and he's been trying to highlight some of the staff, some of these people who support doctors and nurses, keep hospitals going, and he's in Toronto.
We tried to talk to you, doctor, last week and didn't get to you.
I'm glad we got back to you today.
Just tell me why you wanted to do this.
Because this is sort of the people that the Prime Minister today is talking about, these front-line people who aren't doctors and nurses, all the people supporting you.



**Interview**:

Yeah, you know, I think the public is rightly galvanized behind physicians and nurses as true front-line workers.
We are right there with patients, but there is a lot of other front-line workers making genuine sacrifices that are kindof just like quietly working away in the hospital and maybe alittle bit invisible, but they really enable the ecosystem of the hospital to really work, andthese are the people that the Prime Minister has started to recognize, the janitors, the baristas, the personal support workers, cleaning staff, cleaning our scrubs, making rooms clean, delivering food.
So there's a lot of these perhaps under-appreciated and under-recognized folks in the hospital that it really enables doctors to do their jobs and nurses to do their jobs to keep people safe.



**Rosemary**:

Sorry to interrupt you.
So you decided to -- we were just showing some of the photos.
I want people to know that those are your photos, that you found a way to try and highlight them and pay tribute to them.



**Interview**:

Yeah, you know what, I just wasn't hearing a lot of recognition for those folks.
Like I said, doctors and nurses were getting a lot of credit, and I think it's very deserved credit, but I wanted to put a name and a face to some of these other folks to really recognize them and thank them for their very important contribution, their sacrifices, and simply saying, you know, I see you, I recognize you and thank you for what you are doing, and it was Avery easy thing for me to do, and kind of low-hanging fruit, but I thought it was a good way to, you know, drive a sense of camaraderie and unity on the front line, especially when there was a lot of uncertainty at the beginning of this.
Starting at mid-March, when things were really in question.
So I hope it provided some levelof recognition and sense of unity.



**Rosemary**:

I love it. I think it's such a great idea and so good of you to do. You would recognize, though, I guess, as the Prime Minister and the provinces have today, that allot of these people are not paidenough.
I just wonder if you have thoughts about that and whether you think that's something that might change in a bigger way over time now.



**Interview**:

Yeah, you know, my initial goals of this were not political in any way.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.



**Interview**:

But these are folks that I work with in the hospital we all work with and we all know, and we I think had a recognition that they were oftentimes marginalized.
They don't have the same salaries as other people accepting risk.
They don't have hazard pay, and they are still exposed quite regularly, and unfortunately they are from marginalized communities a lot of the times, and they don't have that sense of empowerment or sense of value to really speak up because they are just not empowered, so I think this pandemic has really highlighted what we value in society and how we value people, and I'm very encouraged what the prime Minister and the ford government in Ontario started to give some of that pandemic pay for people.
Hopefully in the future one of the silver linings of this can be sort of recognition and appreciation of those folks, and lot of the times the way we do that in our society is through, you know, security and more money and more appreciation.
So I'm very hopeful that that will actually happen, and I think it's a very positive thing for everyone.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Moonen, how are you holding up? I don't know what your experience has been through this, whether you've had to treat people.
How are you doing?



**Interview**:

Yeah, I'm doing well.
I mean, I think I'm as well as everyone can be. I mean, we're feeling well trained.
We have appropriate P.P.E., at least at My institution.
We have good transparent leadership.
I've been working on obstetrics and urgent care and COVID-19 clinics and all that, so I've been busy, but I think My colleagues and I, as long as we're doing it safely, I think that, to be honest, we feel a really strong sense of purpose in what we're doing.
In a certain way, at least personally, I feel like I signedup for this when I went into medicine, and I feel like I can help a lot of people out right now, so I'm happy to be doing what I'm doing, and to be honest, like, I personally wouldn't be doing anything else.
So I'm happy to be doing it and accepting some risk, but I thinkthere's a good reason for it.



**Rosemary**:

Well, Dr. Moonen, we wanted to talk to you because you were paying tribute to some people who needed that, but let us also thank you at this moment for all your hard work and all your colleagues.



**Interview**:

Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

We really appreciate it. Stay safe and stay healthy.
Thank you so much for your time.



**Interview**:

Appreciate it. You too.
Take care.



**Rosemary**:

That's Dr. Moon en with the university of Toronto.
and I'll tweet out the link to his photos of all those people helping him do his job as a doctor at the university of Toronto.
Want to turn to another story that we are tracking, and I'll get Vassy and Catherine to weigh in after this interview too, because the other thing we are still waiting to hear more about from the government, the Prime Minister said to expect something within days, is an announcement around seniors in this country.
Many of you have emailed and tweeted me about the fact that you need a little extra support too.
The Prime Minister has indicated that is to come, but we wanted to reach out and talk to someone who is waiting to hear more, and that is don Robertson.
He's 82 years old and he lives in Vancouver.
He's a retired united church Minister, and he says that this has exposed, indeed, the neglect of seniors and that there are more things the government can do to help them.
Don, good to see you.
Nice of you to make the time.



**Interview**:

Thank you, rosemary.
Good to be here with you.



**Rosemary**:

Great.
So tell me, first of all tell me how you're doing.
I think it's you and your wife.



**Interview**:

That's right.
We're doing very well, actually.
We have been quite busy during this time.
We have -- zoom, I continue to be involved in the church on the downtown east side and we have committee meetings with zoom and happy four with friends at 5:00 over zoom and meet with the grand kids in Montreal with zoom.
and doing some writing and preparing for a course I'm teaching on seniors and transitions come June.



**Rosemary**:

Amazing.



**Interview**:

So I've been busy.



**Rosemary**:

I think you might be busier than I AM You certainly figured out zoom better than I have.
But let me tell you, I have actually gotten a lot of emails from seniors who are struggling a little bit because there are costs, obviously, that are increasing throughout this, whether it be the cost of food and other things, and they are looking for some additional support.
What are you hearing from your friends or for yourself in terms of what else might be needed?



**Interview**:

Well, certainly seniors are, generally speaking, in the vulnerable group.
I mean, some of us are doing just fine, but there's a lot of seniors that are living on the edge, not only those in assisted living but people that are living on their own, in apartments, and they become part of kind of the invisible senior in our society, and it's important that we find ways of maintaining the connection with the people who become so easily invisible, and I think that more of the economics.
I think it's a question, rosemary, of how we think of seniors and what role they have in our society.
I think of our first nations in Canada and what we can learn about the position of elders in their communities.
I think in some ways we dismiss seniors in our society, and I think we have to reinvent what we understand their role to be.



**Rosemary**:

I agree with you and I think it's something we'veall been sort of exposed to in this in a tragic way in some cases, but I'm glad to see you giving voice to it as well.
I think you do depend on a seniors centre for some meals, if I'm not mistaken, and I wonder if you're still doing that or how you're coping with sort of practical parts of life given that, you're right, you are a more vulnerable part of the population for this pandemic, and leaving the house isn't even really the best idea either.



**Interview**:

Well, the seniors centre is terrific.
We go over there -- I ride over on My bike with My backpack and pick up dinners and something for tea in the afternoon, and they are open from 11 to 2, and the prices are right, so it's a great service.
and grocery stores are really stepping up too.
We have a great delivery system from the grocery store here, so we get our groceries delivered right to the door, and that's a huge service.



**Rosemary**:

That's great.



**Interview**:

Practically, I think we're doing pretty well.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, it sounds like it. Other than the conversation about how we better value older Canadians in our society, is there something the government could do right now that would ease things a little bit for whether it's you or some of our friends, financially?



**Interview**:

Well, there's always a question about what kind of support the governments give to seniors, and I think it's an ongoing conversation.
I was a little concerned when the Prime Minister earlier was talking about years.
I think we need to -- the government and non-profits maybeneed to come together and have conversation about that questionas to how we can support seniors in this society, because I really feel I need to be elevated in terms of how we viewthem and how we think of seniors.
So some kind of -- some have suggested a royal commission.
I don't know about that, but I think we need to look at the overall picture.
Another thing I think we need torecognize, this decision today comes belatedly, and that's veryunfortunate.
We have to recognize that there's been a sacrifice made onthe part of seniors and workers to bring us to this point.
In fact, hundreds have died because of the lack of care and/or because of not being ableto make enough money and having to move from care home to care home.
So that sacrifice I think needs to be recognized in some way.
It's a huge sacrifice.



**Rosemary**:

It sure is. Don, what a pleasure to talk with you and hear about how you're coping with all of this.
It sounds like you're doing verywell, I must say, and I'm glad to hear that.



**Interview**:

Yes, I think we are.
Now you know, we have each other, and that's a huge plus.
I think when you're on your own, it's a different issue, but there's so many ways now that you can be in touch with the world outside of yourself.
I think some training in technology for some seniors is available at seniors centres, but the more people we can get taking that the better because it certainly creates a contact with the world beyond yourself.



**Rosemary**:

Well, that's great at 82 if you're picking all that up and doing that as a result ofthis.
I must say, I admire it a lot.
Thank you so much, don Robertson.
Say hi to your wife for me and we'll speak again.
I appreciate it.



**Interview**:

Thank you very much, rosemary.



**Rosemary**:

Don Robertson in Vancouver.
We are expecting, as I said, some sort of announcement from the federal government around seniors in the coming days.
Not really sure what that will entail, but as you heard there from don, definitely some holes that could be filled in for some of the older Canadians in society who are not necessarily in those long-term care centres but are managing to live by themselves alone right now during a difficult time for everyone.
We want to put a little, like a little bit of different news in, if we can.
It's also not great news, but anyway, officials in newfoundland are in fact cancelling this summer's st. John's regatta.
This is not unlike what happenedin calgary with the stampede.
It will be the first time in st. John's history that this had been cancelled in some 80 years.
So obviously a huge event in that part of the world.
It draws many crowds, athletes, spectators, tourists, and the cbc's chris o'neal yates joins us now, and it would be the crowds that would be the problem, but I'm sure people arevery devastated even if this expected this decision.



**Reporter**:

Absolutely, and I guess we kind of knew, but right now it's official.
You know, the last time the regatta was cancelled we were atwar.
It was in 1940, and newfoundlandwasn't even part of Canada yet, so that's how long it's been.
This would have been the 203rd right here on the banks of the quid vii lake.
This event used to be done in the st. John's harbour, and it moved here, and it's been one of those events where people got together.
It used to be kind of like a towny, a st. John's event, but it's expanded beyond that.
It's a great tourist draw these years, and some 50, 000 people now show up every year.
So it's one of those things that's part of the culture of st. John's. People come and they play games of chance.
There's a lot of music.
There's a lot of food to try.
Some things that, you know, you're not eating every day, butnonetheless, it's one of those events.
The sad part as well, the fact that it's going to result in less money coming in to the economy is that a lot of charities and organizations that raise money, you know, this is the biggest fundraising opportunity for them throughout the year, so the fact that this is cancelled is going to leave them in a bit of a rough spot as well.
So all around it's a sad thing, but you know, these are the times we live in, and this fellow here next to me is an emblem of exactly what's going on in the world right now and what's happening right here in st. John's. No regatta this year for the first time in 80 years.
Not someone anyone wants to think about, but here we are.
These are the times we live in.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, sorry you had to bring us that bad news, but as we say, this is happening across the country, and I'm at least glad to see that it's not bad weather in st. John's today.
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.



You're welcome, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

We're going to take short break.
When we come back, we'll bring you the COVID-19 committee that will be happening virtually.
The Prime Minister expected to appear.
Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen will join me after this short break as well.

**Rosemary**:

Hi again, I'm rosemary Barton here in the nation's capital.
Thanks for joining us on CBC news network" and streaming wherever you might be right around the world, either on our app or CBC.
Ca. We're here, of course, as we are tracking the top stories on COVID-19 in this country.
Essential workers across the country to be defined by the provinces will be expected to see a slightly bigger paycheque.
The Prime Minister says the federal government has reached a$4 billion deal to increase wages for quote unquote essential workers.
He says details of the agreement with the provinces are still being finalized, and the provinces and the territories will decide how the money gets spent.
In other words, where the top-upactually happens.
This is happening on the same day that defence Minister harjitsajjan says that by the middle of may more than 1300 military personnel will be deployed in some 25 long-term care homes in Quebec.
So that's nearly three quarter of Canada's COVID-19 deaths are linked to seniors' residences.
That is really the part of the country that has been hit the hardest.
We wait for both the public health briefing that we will usually get at the top of the hour here.
We're not expecting any federal ministers there today because the vast majority of them eitherworking or going to be part of this COVID-19 committee virtually where they take questions from opposition parties about their response.
and we will bring you that as well when the Prime Minister pops up for the first round of those questions.
Let me bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics" Vassy kapelos and the cbc's catherine cullen in ottawa.
I did want to start off where I left last hour with My new friend don robertson who I'm hoping will invite me to some ofhis zoom cocktail parties, and that is the seniors piece that we are still waiting to hear more about.
and I think the last the Prime Minister said was coming days, and I wonder if we know anythingmore or what we speculate could be there in order to help some seniors who have been hardest hit.
Vassy?



**Vassy**:

The Prime Minister has signalled that it's coming in the coming days, so I was anticipating it as early as today, but I'm guessing it could happen sometime this weekend or perhaps tomorrow.
Basically how are they going to address particularly low-income seniors who are finding that they have additional costs because of sort of their needs and the market right now.
So for example, sometimes getting groceries is more expensive.
The price of food has gone up a bit, but also being able to access that, or even get there, that kind of thing.
So we -- and you're right.
We are inundated with emails andtweets and messages from people who are really anxious to find out what exactly the government -- and I mean, they don't begrudge the help, for example, given to students, but they do wonder why, you know, it's taken a couple more weeks to get them some help.
So as far as where that money might come from, the Prime Minister has indicated already that where low-income seniors are concerned, there is a gst credit available to them, $400, $600 for a couple.
I wondered does it come through the guaranteed income supplement, will that get a boost which is already addressing low-income seniors through the pension program, essentially.
The leader of the bloc quÉbÉcoishas asked for pension programs to be expanded, for the money tocome through there.
I think the question is how muchmoney is it going to be. is it going to be enough to makea difference.
Who will qualify and what program will deliver it. I don't think -- I don't have much doubt that there will be something.
I mean, the Prime Minister has been pretty explicit about that.
I think, again, as I keep sayingi feel like all day, the devil will be in the details.
It will also be interesting to see if this is purely administered by the federal government or if there is some provincial collaboration alongside it.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, and it has been really the most vulnerable seniors, seniors who are on old age supplements or the guaranteed income supplement, you're right, that might see top-ups.
There were some requests for seniors who are better off who are rrsps or investments to findways to give them a bit of a taxbreak if they need to pull any of that extra money out to support themselves during this time.
So we'll see.
I also thought it might be this week.
We'll see, there's still one dayleft in the week, the workweek, anyway, so perhaps tomorrow.
Catherine, let's just talk before we hear from Dr. Tam and Dr. Njoo about the announcement today, because it is a big one.
It's a lot of money, and it willbe interesting to see how that unfolds too.



Yeah, and I would say big picture, rosemary, that both the discussion that you were having with Vassy about seniors and the announcement today, all of this is a bit of a reality check.
For so many days the discussion has been about re-starting provinces, reopening.
Obviously we know the situation changes from one province to thenext, but today is a powerful reminder of some of the challenges facing seniors, facing long-term care centres and facing the people who work in those centres.
We were talking earlier about the fact that this announcement today, a total of $4 billion, $3billion that's come federal government the federal government, another billion that's expected to come from theprovinces as they try to get money out the door to whomever the provinces deem essential workers.
We no in many cases we're talking about workers in long-term care centres, workers in the health care sectors, people in some cases working in grocery stores and whatnot.
This is all a reminder of the fact that this is part of a bigger systemic issue that needsto be addressed, and that even as we talk about these questionsof re-starting and reopening provinces, there are some very acute problems.
We talked earlier about the canadian forces increasing the number of soldiers that they aregoing to be making available in Quebec going to new long-term care centres.
Obviously Quebec, again, a very acute case.
The island of montreal in particular and the surrounding area, but still a lot of major concerns that need to be addressed and dealt with.
Earlier today I saw an ad from the government of Quebec advertising their program, reaching out to low-income workers, so certainly some hope that there's going to be uptake for this because we depend so much on these people.
We did before the outbreak.
We maybe didn't think about it very much, but now we realize how much we depend on them and we're asking them to put their health and safety in jeopardy.



**Rosemary**:

and so many people now just volunteering to go into the long-term care centres to help out in any way they can.
I'm going to start with our public health officials briefingus today on this federal, the national picture, and then we'lltake you to the COVID-19 committee when it gets under way.
This is Dr. Theresa tam.



-- including 4, 280 deaths.
and over 28, 000 cases or 44% nowrecovered.
Labs across Canada have tested over 1 million people for COVID-19 to date.
With about 6% of these testing positive.
In the past week, we've tested an average of over 25, 000 peopledaily.
As mental health week continues, today's focus is on children andyouth mental health.
It's certainly not unexpected that kids will have lots of questions about COVID-19. Providing children and youth with information and extra nurturing can go a long way to offer reassurance and help to build up their resilience.
Parents and caregivers can find lots of good tips to help kids and youth on websites such as the kids' help phone.
Things like how to check in often, to communicate and share information, calm their fears, help them to practise online safety, and to engage in activities that can nurture mental health.
As I said yesterday, talking things out can help to process our thoughts and lift the weightof our emotions, and this is as true for kids as it is for adults.
and when you start the conversation and share your thoughts and feelings it can help children and youth to open up and voice their own struggles.
While kids may be missing their friends and other family members, maintaining virtual connections reminds us all that we are not alone.
One thing that helps us all is the feeling that we are helping.
a key way that children and youth help lift our spirits is through creativity and ingenuity.
Their imagination is an inspiration.
They have adorned windows with rainbow signs and messages for neighbours, friends and essential workers.
They have created virtual choirs, apps and trackers.
Reinforcing the positive energy of youth is a big step towards building resilience, not just for them but for all of us. Thank you.

**Dr. Howard Njoo**:

Good afternoon.
As usual I will start with the latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada.
There are now 63, 875 cases including over 4, 000 deaths and 28, 000, or 44% now recovered.
Labs across Canada have tested over 1 million people for COVID-19 to date.
and 6% of these tested positive.
In the past week we've tested, on average, over 25, 000 people daily.
As mental health week continues, today's focus is on children and youth mental health.
It is certainly not unexpected that kids will have lots of questions about COVID-19, providing children and youth with information and extra nurturing can go a long way to offer reassurance and help to build up their resilience.
Parents and caregivers can find lots of good tips to help kids and youth on websites such as kids help phone.
Things like how to check in often, to communicate and share information, calm their fears, help them to practise online safety, and to engage in activities that can nurture mental and emotional health.
As I said yesterday, talking things out can help to process our thoughts and lift the weight of our emotions.
This is as true for kids as it is for adults.
and when you start the conversation and share your own thoughts and feelings, it can help children and youth to open up and voice their own struggles.
While kids may be missing their friends and other family members, maintaining virtual connections reminds us all that we are not alone.
One thing that helps us all is the feeling that we are helping.
a key way that children and youth help lift our spirits is through creativity and ingenuity.
Their imagination is an inspiration, and they have adorned windows with rainbow signs and messages for neighbours, friends and essential workers.
They have created virtual choirs, apps and trackers.
Reinforcing the positivity of youth is a big step towards building resilience, not just for them but for all of us. [ end of interpretation ]



Thank you, doctors.
We will now open the line to questions.
We ask that you limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up. For those asking a question in the room, we do ask that you make your way over to the free-standing mics.
Operator, over to you.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Our first question [ no interpretation ]please go ahead.
Your line is now open.
[voice of interpreter]



**Reporter**:

Hello, Dr. Njoo.
I'd like to hear your comments on how well Canadians are following directions.
Canadians have followed all the directives and advice and guidance since the beginning, that you keep repeating.
With new directives it's not clear in each of the provinces, from one province to the next, and sometimes from one region to the next.
Do you feel we must be particularly vigilant with Canadians adherence to these directives? or do you fear that things will relax too much?



**Dr. Howard Njoo**:

Thank you for the question.
I think so. Dr. Tam and I are constantly discussing current issues with our provincial and territorial counterparts.
Certainly in each province and territory, as you said, the relaxing of public health guidelines are being done with great prudence.
We agree with the fundamental principles.
As each province and territory moves ahead, of course one must continue good hygiene practices, keeping our social distancing, physical distancing from others, washing our hands, and all the other public health measures.
Which, as you say, we keep reinforcing and repeating.
But the implementation of these measures in each province and territory depends somewhat on the epidemiology.
Even in each province, for example, in Montreal, the situation is far different from the situation in lac st. Jean, so we have to look at the epidemiology and what's going Onion the ground.
Of course the context of a large city will be quite different from what we see in a northern territory.
But we're all on the same page ultimately, and plans that have been made public by various provinces and territories, it seems to me that they are still respecting the same fundamental principles.
Now the rate of change may be different from one province to another.
In some provinces they open schools, in others no. So these aspects may be a bit different.
As long as we're just keeping an eye on the curve and the epidemiology, because of course what took place in British Columbia is different from what's currently going on in Quebec.
So we're keeping an eye and everyone's on the same page, and think Canadians understand quite well what all the public health authorities, not just at the federal level, but in each province and territory, are quite well aligned, in fact.
Thank you.



Follow-up question?



**Reporter**:

My next question has to do with a very specific example of people who can't see their way through these new directives.
People between age 60 and 69 in Quebec who could go back to work in schools, in daycare centres and who -- school buses, but we don't really understand why these people cannot -- [ end of interpretation ]



**Rosemary**:

All right, we're going to pull away from the public health officials briefingtoday.
They do confirm that there have now been 1 million tests done incanada for COVID-19, 6% of the population testing positive.
Let's bring you to something else happening right now in the nation's capital.
This is the special committee oncovid-19. That meeting is happening over video conference, as you can seethere.
On the very top left of your screen you can see how many MPs have called in, 141 of them on video, 107 not wanting to show their backgrounds at this stage.
This is green party -- interim green party leader Elizabeth may trying to make a point of order.
This can be a little chaotic, but we will listen in for when questions start here to cabinet ministers.
Let's listen.



She was also named by the --



I didn't recognize anyone.
I don't know who's speaking, so I'll just start talking myself.
I just want to remind the honourable members to have respect in their questions and in their answers.
When you refer to someone, please prefer to them respectfully.
This is a committee of the house, and I would expect no less of the honourable members.
We'll go on to the honourable Minister who will answer that question.
They have 16 seconds.



Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector.
We need their innovation.
We need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we're going to reach our --



We will go to ms. Baulk again.



Mr. Speaker, it has been 43 days since the finance Minister promised liquidity through the business development bank of Canada, and now for 43 days the finance Minister has failed to deliver on that promise.
These delays cost jobs and they are costing us Canadian businesses.
If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign unethically sourced oil.
Mr. Speaker, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energyfirms?



**The Chair**:

I want to remind the honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating.
So in consideration to them, please speak at a reasonable pace so that they can understand and then translate.
The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the very beginning our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country.
We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including in Alberta and Saskatchewan, in British Columbia, in Newfoundland and Labrador, in the energy sector to support them to be able to support their families through this difficult time.
We are also working on sect oral supports right across the country, and those will be announced in due course, but our focus from the get-go has been --



**The Chair**:

We will go on to ms. Faulk.



Mr. Speaker, another group that has been ignored by the liberals is our farmers.
The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food -- instead of responding to the specific COVID-19 challenges.
Our farmers are facing the liberals re-announced $125 million that was already budgeted in the agri recovery program.
Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food splinechain seriously or is agriculture just an afterthoughtfor him?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

On the contrary, Mr. Speaker, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs, and we will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sectors, safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality canadian food on to our tables right across the country.
Supporting the people who produce our food is a priority for this government and will continue to be.



**The Chair**:

Ms. Faulk.



Well, Mr. Speaker, recycled program announcements do not respond to the immediate needs facing our farmers.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
Our farmers are faced with raising operational cost, a disruptive service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants.
The government has a responsibility to take domestic food security seriously.
When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our Ag industry?



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I would suggest with respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry.
I certainly agree that there is more to do every step of the way in this unprecedented situation we have been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting, on investing more.
We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables.



**The Chair**:

Ms. Faulk.



Mr. Speaker, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given.
Our farmers are trying to keep Canadians fed while keeping their heads above water.
The liberal government's own failed federal carbon tax is weighing them down.
It is an enormous hit to their bottom line and the recent carbon tax hike is taking more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least.
Mr. Speaker, will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them?



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Mr. Speaker, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentally unintentionally, I'm certain, mislead the house and Canadians.
The price on pollution actually puts more money into Canadians' pockets, and that includes farm families, people who make -- who pay the cost of the price on pollution on average receive more money back.
This is a way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen.
We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money -- [voice of interpreter]



**The Chair**:

We will now move on to ms. Gill.



Thank you, Mr. Chair.
All sectors of the economy are fragile, and I'm thinking more specifically about the fisheries.
In the Magdalena islands we have the lobster fishers on the shore, people fishing in gaspÉ as well.
Imports have stopped.
There's also a drop in the domestic market because of the tourism sector, restaurants, ET cetera, so we need to provide some assistance to fishers.
What has the government done since the start of the crisis to support fishers?



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Fishers do an exceptional job and are contributing to feeding Canadians and to our exports abroad.
This crisis has hit them hard, and that's why we put in place money to support processors.
We have made announcements to help fishers.
We know that this is an unprecedented situation, a difficult situation.



**The Chair**:

Ms. Gill?



I thank the Prime Minister, but in fact what I'm asking for is assistance.
He's talking about the $62.5 million for processors that will go to freezing the product.
But I'm talking about the people doing the fishing themselves.
The economic situation is such that fishers are facing health risks because we know that there are the issues, physical distancing, it's difficult for them.
So they have additional amounts they need to pay out in order to participate in their regular activities, their fishing activities, but at the same timethey're going to be facing a deficit because of the cost of resources they're going to be running a deficit now.
They are essential to the economy, the agricultural economy.
Fishers, deckhands and others, seasonal workers, don't know what the future holds.
They don't know how they're going to put food on the table for their families next year.
So will you be doing something else in addition to the $62.5 million? because they have been facing uncertainty for a long time now, and they are very concerned.



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We will be making additional investments to support Canadians in a number of sectors.
We recognize that fishers are facing challenges when it comes to physical distancing, the seasonal nature of their work in many cases, and we're going to continue to work with the industry to help fishers with communities in coastal areas so that people can have confidence in their capacity and in their future.
It's important for the government to be there for people, and that is exactly whatwe're going to continue to do. This is an unprecedented crisis, and again we can see that assistance is required and we will continue to reach out and to help fishers and the fishing industry.



**The Chair**:

Ms. Gill.



It's a difficult crisis.
We needed to be there from the outset.
We know full well that several weeks went by. They need time to prepare for fishing activities, and there are many changes that could be -- adjustments that could be made to current programs when Otto the size of the companies, for example.
The $40, 000 is something that could be helpful, but they don'thave the payroll.
The 75%, because of the dates, they can't qualify for that as well.
So there are a number of solutions that we can -- I can share with the government and the Minister of fisheries to come to their assistance quickly, to help them.
They want to participate in the crisis effort, but at the same time they have no guarantees that they will have support theyneed.
So I'd like a guarantee that they will be supported and that they will be able to, in fact, put food on their tables and feed their communities, because the fishing industry is a major industry in their communities.



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Since the outset, Minister Jordan has been working with fishers, with the industry, with communities that are affected by the crisis.
We have put forth a number of solutions to support communities, to support their families.
The situation is unprecedented, and from the outset our objective was to help Canadians across the country in all industries, people who have lost their jobs.
and we have done so. We will continue, as well, to work for -- to help people who are facing uncertainty.
That is what people expect of the government.



**The Chair**:

Before we go to the next question, I'd like to remind members to speak slowly and to speak through the chair.
Not to speak directly to others.
Thank you.
[ end of interpretation ]we will now go on MO Mr. Bacharak.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, municipalities across Canada are facing a financial crisis.
They have seen revenues plummets, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen.
As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to rundeficits, and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. We know that municipalities are vital during this time to provide services to Canadians, and they are going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. Fcm, the federation of Canadian municipalities, and mayors across Canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector.
My question to the Prime Minister is when they can expect federal financial support to arrive.



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Mr. Speaker, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the federation of Canadian municipalities to respond to the challenges they are facing, to partner with them, things from infrastructure to investments that have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns large and small from coast to coast to coast.
But as I'm sure the member well knows, our constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces.
We are working with the provinces as we continue to work with the cities to ensure that we're able to support these -- this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means.
We know how --



**The Chair**:

We will go back to the member, now.



Mr. Speaker, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis.
Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector.
These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers or grocery store workers, janitors a others.
The risk is that we're going to see higher fares to deal with this financial crisis.
We're going to see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities.
Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in and safeguard and protect Canada's transit services?



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

This federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy.
We will continue to work with the provinces who have jurisdiction over the municipalities.
I will be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues.
I can highlight that the issue of transit funding has come up, and we have continued to engage with them.
But again, Mr. Speaker, it is important to respect the constitution and understand that funding for a municipality and city does go through the provinces.
The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must --



**The Chair**:

We will go on to Mr. Bacharach again.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker she cannot access the federal wage subsidy while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program.
Could the Prime Minister explain how that is fair.



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction, and the airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction.
We have been able to move forward on that.
But more than that, we have brought the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country because it's something the federal government knew we needed to --



**The Chair**:

We'll go back to Mr. Bacharach.



Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in My riding are taking matters into their own hands.
The new hock have put up a checkpoint on highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel, and in particular to protect thethree remaining fluent speakers of the language, these cherishedelders in their community.
The haida on haida gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia.
Yet the federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in British Columbia does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in My riding and across the country?



**The Chair**:

The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the very beginning we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous, remote or northern communities who we knew were going to be facing more difficult challenges because of their existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and in socio-economic circumstances.
We have made unprecedented investments, and we will continue to make these investments necessary because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians and indeed all Canadians have the supports they need to make it through this crisis.
[voice of interpreter]



**The Chair**:

We are going to continue on with Mr. Berthold.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm going to deal with the area of jurisdiction that the Minister talked about and the incompetence of the liberals to deliver infrastructure programs.
My question is to the Minister of infrastructure and communities.
As the provinces are gradually reopening their economies, can the Minister tell us how many projects submitted by the provinces are currently waiting for government's approval?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Prime Minister.
Or the honourable Minister.
Somebody.
is there somebody who will -- who is on mute? who would like to answer the question?



I hope that this time will not be taken off from My time.



**The Chair**:

No, no. The clock has stopped.
I think it's ms. Mckenna who will answer.



I'm sorry, I was on mute.
So Mr. Chair, I'm very happy to see how well we're working with the provinces and the territories.
I have worked and talked to all My counterparts in the province sand territories in relation to this historical program relating to infrastructure.
We have worked very hard in My department to approve the projects, and we're going to continue to do so. and it's important that we continue.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Berthold.



Well, we didn't have an answer.
How many projects are waiting government approval? I know that the Minister has been holding more and more virtual meetings, but there are still hundreds of projects awaiting approval from the liberal government.
Instead of waiting for the right political opportunity to unblock these files, will the Minister commit today to respect the provinces and approve all the projects that are sitting on her desk by next week?



**The Chair**:

Ms. Mckenna?



Mr. Chair, I AM very happy to say how well we are working with the provinces and territories, that we are approving projects, and so if the member wants to speak with the provinces and territories, he'll see how well we're working together, and we're going to announce the projects because it's important for our communities and economies and it's important to create good jobs.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Berthold.



Does the Minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still awaiting and that the construction season is very short and that a project approval in July means that work cannot begin until next year? and so this will not help us to re-start the economy.



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Chair, I can clarify that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last weeks and that we're going to work with the provinces and territories and municipalities, as well as indigenous communities, to go forward with these projects.



**The Chair**:

So we'll go back to Mr. Berthold.



Mr. Chair, while the minister is talking about the green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is in jeopardy.
Social distancing measures will drive down the use of public transit for months to come.
There's a study that the um estimates that monthly losses are up to $100 million.
Other countries have included transit pandemic programs.
Why not Canada?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Chair, we recognize how important it is to support public transit.
It's important for our economy because there are essential workers who use public transit, and we are working very closely with municipalities and are listening to them, but as the Prime Minister stated, it's up to the provinces to --



**The Chair**:

Mr. Berthold.



Once again we are saying that the puck is being passed on to the provinces and the Minister isn't able to answer questions relating to the projects that are on the Minister's desk, and it's tremendously important to talk about the approval of theseprojects, especially in various large municipalities.
and as we know, as there has been a reduction of 80 and 90% in terms of ridership, and the federation of Canadian municipalities, large cities and small communities across the country need help.
Why is the Minister ignoring the needs of the Canadian municipalities?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Chair, I can reassure the member of parliament that we're working closely with the municipalities, that we're listening to them to see what their issues are, how we can support them, but of course we need help from the provinces and the territories, and as concerns of the project that have been approved, I will be happy to provide you with the precise number of all the projects that My department has worked on in the last weeks to approve those projects such that they can go forward.



Mr. Chair, is there still time?



**The Chair**:

No, that's it. [ end of interpretation ]we'll now go on MO Mr. Fast.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This question is directed to the minister of foreign affairs.
On March 28, he personally tweeted out a thank you to the people's republic of china for donating P.P.E. S to Canada.
This tweet happened within threehours of china announcing that gift.
Now as it turned out many of these P.P.E. S were defective andcould not be used.
More recently taiwan donated half a million surgical masks tocanada, and yet here we are two weeks later and the Minister hasyet to personally thank taiwan for its generosity.
Will the Minister now thank thisfree and democratic country for its generous gift to Canadians?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank My colleague for the question.
Indeed we are very grateful to every nation for helping Canada.
This is a global pandemic which knows no border.
We have been expressing our thanks to many nations who have contributed.
We will continue to do so. It is important in a time of pandemic, Mr. Speaker, that we don't play politics, that humanity comes together.
I can say to My COVID-19 foreign ministers call, the world community has come together to make sure that we would make sure that supply chain would remain in tact, that we would have transit ops and bridges and we would continue, Mr. Speaker, to work with every nation when it comes to health.
This is a public good that we want to work together --



**The Chair**:

We will go back tomr.
Fast now.



Well, there speaker, I didn'thear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again.
On May 4 the government of Taiwan delivered 25, 000 surgical masks to the government of British Columbia.
On hand were British Columbia's Minister of citizens services and Minister of state for child care who, as ministers, officially thanked the government of Taiwan for itsdonation.
Again, will the Minister now do the right thing and on behalf ofcanadians recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, as I said to youbefore, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada.
This is a common endeavour.
We are thankful and grateful to every nation.
We will continue to do so, like I said, when it comes to global help, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together, and we are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need and I've repeated that and said that in many times in many forums, Mr. Speaker, that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Fast.



Well, no specific thank you to Taiwan again.
The government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have allot to learn from them and theirresponse.
Sadly, the people's republic of china continues to oppose taiwan's membership in the world health organization.
Will the Minister now do the right thing and assure canadiansthat he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the world health organization?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the member.
As a former trade Minister, he'svery well aware of Canada's one china policy.
That being said, Mr. Speaker, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forum, particularly when it comes to health, Mr. Speaker.
This is a global good and we want to support every nation and we recognize that Taiwan and others have been doing very well in fighting this pandemic.
We also believe that taiwan's role as an observer in the world health assembly meeting is of interest to the world health community.



**The Chair**:

We will now go back to Mr. Fast.



Thank you.
I will pivot to repatriation.
The Minister has said that over 20, 000 stranded Canadians have been repatriated from abroad.
Can he tell us how many Canadians remain abroad that have expressed their desire to be repatriated?



I'm happy to update members that as of today we have repatriated more than 20, 000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87countries, and I would say [indiscernible] Mr. Speaker, it knows no parties, every member or many members I should say have written to me to make sure that we take care.
It's not an exact science.
We have repatriated thousands and thousands.
We continue because we know there are still pockets of travellers, of Canadian travellers which are stranded abroad.
As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will use our best efforts to repatriate everyone that wants to come back home.



**The Chair**:

We will go on to Mr. Moore now.



Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, Canadians need to have faith in their justice system, even in time of crisis.
My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free.
As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new useless gun laws, will the Minister of justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free due to delays in the justice system?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I thank the honourable member for his question.
We have been working, Mr. Speaker, with My provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various courts, federal, the federal courts, but also through My provincial counterparts with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada.
We each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that a basic number of essential services within the court system are maintained through a variety of means.
and we believe that we --



**The Chair**:

We will go back to the member now.



Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as way to help small- and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those inmy riding.
In atlantic Canada, this was to be distributed to the atlantic Canada opportunities agency.
This is yet another announcementwith no details from this liberal government.
Can the Minister clarify, are wedays away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety.
That's why Alcoa is doing great work on the ground to make sure that we can help them through this very difficult period.
Now the member is right, we have increased the budget of acoa, good news, and I will be coming up with the details very soon, and it will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many business and business owners across the Atlantic region.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Moore?



Mr. Chair, My office has -- had many small business owners that have reached out to me, and know have reached out to many of My colleagues and probably all of us here today who are frustrated by the eligibility requirements for some of the federal programs.
In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account because they do not have payroll, and this could be like the hair salon in My riding who subcontracts out their chairs.
There's hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this verysituation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement.
These businesses, many of them are weeks away from shutting down permanently.
What does the Minister of finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, I want to thank My honourable colleague for that really important question, and want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very, very hard to make sure that you are supported through this difficult period.
So more work needs to be done, and we will continue to do that work.
We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they are getting help, whether it's rent or whether it's helping defray costs by keeping their costs low by deferring payments, gist payments.
We will continue to work with all of our businesses.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Moore, a briefquestion, I hope.
Less than 20 seconds, please.



Mr. Chair, it's a very specific issue.
It's small businesses, thousands of them, that do not have a payroll or some who have a personal account rather than a business account that they have dealt with over the years, and that makes them ineligible.
These businesses need help rightnow.



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister, in 20 seconds or less, please.



I agree with the honourable member.
Those businesses absolutely need the support from us. We're going to keep working to ensure that they are supported.



**The Chair**:

We'll go to Mr. Cummings next.



Mr. Speaker, small businesses are worried about their ability to survive and no amount of loans or subsidies can substitute the need to be open and serving their customers.
Can the government confirm that a sect oral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member that we have been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy, that we need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do to in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians.
We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages that wehave put forward --



**The Chair**:

We will go back tomr.
Cummings now.



Mr. Speaker, thousands of business owners make a living and they utilize dividends as their salary.
They also use independent contractors.
Can the government confirm the current programs in place will be expanded for these hard-working Canadians.



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses, and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue.
and I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure that you are supported.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Cummings.



Can the Minister give me a date to be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



I want to assure our canadiansmall businesses how important they are and the contributions that they make to all of our communities and know that we continue to listen and we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported --



**The Chair**:

Mr. Cummings.



Minister, they need more thanassurance.
Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses that they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their business?



**The Chair**:

The honourable Minister.



Mr. Speaker, these businesses are absolutely important, and they are getting support through range of means, and we will continue to work with these businesses to make sure that they continue to be supported through this difficult period.



**The Chair**:

Mr. Cummings.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, we're going to pull away from the COVID-19 virtual committee.
There are about 300 parliamentarians there asking some questions, initially of the prime Minister, but then of other ministers.
I'll bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos and the cbc's Catherine Cullen both with me here in Ottawa.
We'll end on that last point because I know you have been thinking about that a lot too, Vassy, the businesses who have dividends or contract work out.
You know, if you hire people to do work for your business but they are not your employees, these are still problems within the programs that are available, and it didn't sound to me like the Minister of small business had much to offer there.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, and those have been persistent questions right from the start of this when the government first announced what kind of financial aid they would be offering businesses, so these businesses in particular can't qualify for the emergency loan.
They can't qualify for the wage subsidy, and they have been continually asking, is there anything you can do for us, and the Minister of small business, Mary nag there, has talked in thepast, and others ministers have referred them to, for example, access to CERB.
So they will get $2, 000 a month.
But while that may help in their personal circumstances, it doesn't do anything for their business.
It doesn't help them, for example, when they have to pay rent.
and so we have been hearing a lot from them for I would say almost six weeks now.
There was no clear answer there from the Minister on what can beexpected.
Melanie jolly at one point a couple of weeks ago told me that the sort of regional developmentagencies, which she mentioned would be seeing an increase in budgets, could be the place for them to go. But again, there are no specifics on that.
The other thing I want to flag, and I know this is something you've been following as well, is around municipalities.
So municipalities have talked for a number of weeks now about the hit they are taking.
They obviously -- their tax base, their means of revenue has been severely contradicted.
They are all -- constricted.
All the cities, big and small, are facing huge budgetary shortfalls.
They can't run deficits by law, 99.9% of them.
They are asking for a $10 billion emergency fund from the federal government.
The Prime Minister got a number of questions on that, and specifically around transit as well.
The estimation from the canadianmunicipalities is public transit is losing $400 million a month believe is the estimate.
No clear answers from the Prime Minister if there would be help from the federal government for that.
Provinces so far have -- obviously they have jurisdiction over municipalities, but as the mp who was asking questions of the Prime Minister pointed out, provinces are in a bind right now as well.
So I'm curious to see I guess as we move ahead if in fact there won't be any help from the federal government.
I would be surprised if that were the case because mayors have been telling us that their conversations with deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland have so far been encouraging, but they have asked for a huge chunk of change.
They will eventually at the end of the year hit a wall when it comes to their budgetary deficits, and transit will be a big issue as economies reopen.
People will have to get to their jobs especially in larger centres via that public transit.
No clear answers from the government on that either.



**Rosemary**:

You're right, it ISS jurisdictional issue, and that's what the Prime Minister kept saying in his answers.
There is the gas tax fund which allows the federal government to funnel money to municipalities for infrastructure and things like that.
So it's not as though it couldn't be done.
It's just when you do it, how much you do it and how that would actually work.
Catherine, anything stood out for you there?



Yeah, well, picking up on that point, I thought it was interesting seeing perhaps to some extent given how local British Columbia and john Horgan have been about this issue.
It's not necessarily a surprise to see an NDP mp from British Columbia raising this question, but it was also interesting to see the conservatives chiming in. Mr. Bert hold saying he had questions specifically for Catherine mckenna around infrastructure and transit.
Interesting to see the push across party lines there.
I thought the most interesting exchange was the one between ed fast and the Minister about Taiwan.
Maybe that's not necessarily an issue that's on the minds of allcanadians, but Mr. Fast really pushing the foreign affairs Minister there, saying can't you just say thank you to Taiwan for these masks.
We saw -- it was clear the foreign affairs Minister did not want to say the word "taiwan" in the first few answers.
Obviously Canada is in a bit of a sensitive situation here, even before this outbreak.
There was a lot of tension with Canada and china relating to the detention of Meg Lanzhou and now of course these two Canadians, the michaels, who are still languishing in china, but also now an added layer of Canada's dependence on china to get personal protective equipment.
So a very politically sensitive situation, and the conservatives really sort of poking at the Minister there, trying to draw him out on this issue.



**Rosemary**:

Okay, thank you for highlighting that too.
Vassy kapelos, can you see her on her program later tonight at 5 eastern.
Catherine Cullen will be everywhere and anywhere you want to see her.
Thank you both very much for your help with our coverage.
Appreciate it. Just remind you that the primary announcement from the Prime Minister today was really about trying to boost the help, the salaries, the wages of essential workers in this country, $4 billion to try and do that between the federal government and the provinces.
More information to come from provinces.
We want to leave you now with a scene that took place just a little bit ago in Quebec city.
That's the snowbirds taking off a short time ago.
They are continuing their tour of Canada to honour front-line workers and give us maybe a mostneeded boost as well.
I'm rosemary barton.
Coverage continues here on "cbc news network" with Andrew nichols.
