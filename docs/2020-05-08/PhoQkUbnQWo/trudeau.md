# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Earlier today we received the job report for April.
These numbers tell us what we already knew, that right now Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic.
Everyone has their own story, but it all boils down to a very difficult time for a lot of people.
Canadians aren't alone in this as the world faces COVID-19, but if you're out of work, you don'tneed to hear that other people are out of work too.
You need to know that there's a plan to get you through this and get you back on the job.
and that's exactly what this government is focused on. [voice of interpreter]today we received the employmentreport for the month of April, and the figures confirm what we've known for some time now.
Many of you are suffering, you're hurting because of this pandemic.
and what matters most to you is knowing that there is a plan to help you get through this and return to work as quickly as possible.
and that is what our government is focused on. [ end of interpretation ]-- unprecedented challenge, we've taken action.
Maybe you're one of the more than 7 million people getting the CERB to make -- help make ends meet, or better yet, maybe thanks to the wage subsidy your employer has been able to rehireyou.
That's what's happened for people who work at pursuit, a ban ff tourism company.
They are back on the job because of this program.
We created the Canada emergency wage subsidy to protect jobs wherever possible.
Since it launched last week, employers have applied for subsidies for almost 2 million workers, and as provinces and territories start to gradually reopen over the coming months, and the CERB becomes less and less needed, this subsidy will play an even greater role.
That's why I can announce today that we will be extending the Canada emergency wage subsidy beyond June to help kick start our economic reopening and boostjobs.
We will have more details next week, but to businesses hit by COVID-19, know this: the wage subsidy will continue to be there for you to help you keep your employees on the payroll.
So fill out the application at Canada.
Ca if you haven't already done so. and if you had to let people go, try to bring them back.
It's those workers who will drive our economies' short and long-term recovery.
On other support, the Canada emergency business account has been accessed by well over half a million businesses to give them much-needed loans.
Between the ceba and the wage subsidy, we're helping employersacross the country keep Canadians on the job.
Now even though we're reaching millions of Canadians, we need to reach even more.
We're working around the clock to update and adjust so that help gets to as many workers, small businesses, families and young people as possible.
We also know that some sectors have been hit especially hard, so we're stepping up on that too.
Minister Bains will be leading anew industry strategy council chaired by monique l'heureux, this council will take a deeper dive into how the pandemic is affecting specific sectors and how to best support them.
We are leveraging expertise fromthe economic strategy tables we set up in the first mandate, as well as looking to new industry leaders.
This will be a dedicated forum for industry and government to come together on tackling the effects of COVID-19, and it builds on what we've already done for workers in everything from energy to agriculture.
On that note, Minister gill bault will have more details at noon about how our $500 million package for arts, culture and amateur sport is now being rolled out to support workers inthose sectors.
This investment will help peopleaccess wage support and help organizations access funding.
Our artists, creators and young athletes inspire us and help us feel connected, even when we're at home.
They are there for us, and we'regoing to be there for them.
No matter where you work, no matter who you are, these are tough times.
But with the right plan, we willget through this and will come back stronger than ever.
[voice of interpreter]Canada is facing an unprecedented challenge, so we've taken measures that are also unprecedented.
You may be among the 7 million Canadians who are receiving the Canada emergency response benefit, or perhaps you were re-hired thanks to the emergencywage subsidy.
We created that subsidy to protect jobs as much as possible.
Since the launch of the program last week, employers have already applied for the wage subsidy for some 2 million workers.
and today I AM announcing that we will be extending the wage subsidy beyond the month of juneto kick start the economy and also boost job creation.
We will have additional details on this next week, but canadian businesses affected by COVID-19 should know this: the wage subsidy will be there for you and your workers.
I invite you to apply on Canada.
Ca if you haven't done soalready.
and if you had to lay people off, try to rehire those employees, if possible.
Those workers are the ones that will help us to kick start the economy in the long and short term.
Canadians want to work, so we'regoing to help them to return to work.
Thanks to this wage subsidy, there are other measures such asthe Canada emergency business account that is helping employers to keep their employees on the payroll.
Today we also have news for the culture sector.
Minister guilbeault will be providing additional details on this, but basically we are supporting artists, cultural industries, musicians, young athletes and creators.
To understand the consequence ofcovid-19 on these sectors, we are introducing the industry strategic council.
It will be chaired by monique l'heureux, and the council's mandate will be to take a deep dive into the effects of COVID-19 and specific sectors and particularly to look at whatwe can do to support workers.
We are taking advantage of the knowledge of -- and expertise ofthe economic strategic tables weput in place previously, as wellas that of new leaders.
We are going through a difficulttime right now, but with the right plan we will come back stronger than ever.
[ end of interpretation ]it's hard to think of tougher times for our country, but as our elders remind us, Canada hasfaced challenges before.
and we've always overcome them.
Today we mark the 75th anniversary of victory TN europeday and the end of the second world war on the continent.
After six years of war, it must have felt like that day would never come.
But it did.
and it came because of the courage of all who served and because of the sacrifice of all who gave their lives.
It has been 75 years since our grandparents and great-grandparents stood up to do their part, 75 years since they stood united and strong to ensure that we would live in peace and freedom.
Today, as our generation faces our own battle, let us be inspired by them and their valour as we protect them and all Canadians.
This is our challenge, and I know we will rise to meet it. Merci.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone lines for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?
