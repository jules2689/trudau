### Summary:



Over the past few months we've introduced programs that are making a real difference in the lives of millions of people right across the country.
So our government responded rapidly and substantially to support Canadians with programs like the Canada emergency response benefit and the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
Many workers will be able to find work, but others won't. Over the past few months, Canadians have been able to count on the Canada emergency response benefit to help them get through a tough time, and the reality is that even as we start to reopen, a lot of people still need this support to pay their bills while they look for work.
So if you've been getting the CERB and you still can't work because you're unable to find a job or it's just not possible, you will keep getting that $2, 000 a month.
Over the next few weeks, our government will look at international best practices and monitor the economy and the progression of the virus to see what changes, if any, need to be made to the program so that more people are properly supported.
Our goal here is to make sure that the CERB is working for you in the best way possible.
This pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our country, and we're going to make sure that all of our supports, including the Canada emergency wage subsidy and employment insurance are working effectively to get Canadians back on their feet.

Some sectors will rebound more quickly than others, and many people will find work, but not everyone will.
In recent months, Canadians wereable to rely on the emergency response benefit to get through these tough times, but the reality is that even if some activities are starting up again, a lot of people still need that support to pay their bills as they seek work.
That means that if you are receiving the CERB and you cannot return to work because you can't find any work or simply because it just isn't possible right now, you will continue to receive your $2, 000 a month.
In the coming weeks, our government will be looking at international best practices, as well as monitoring the economy and the progression of the virus, to determine whether we need to make other changes to the program to provide more support to people.
The pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for our country, and we want to ensure that all supports, including theemergency wage subsidy and employment insurance, are there to help Canadians get back on their feet.
We want to give you the support that you deserve during this turbulent time, and in fact that's one of the reasons why proposed to give the provinces and territories some $14 billionso that you have the child care services that you need, so that we can increase testing and contact tracing, and so that youcan return to work safely.
