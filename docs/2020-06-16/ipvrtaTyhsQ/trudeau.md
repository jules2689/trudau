# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past few months we've introduced programs that are making a real difference in the lives of millions of people right across the country.
Take the rose and crown pub in canmore, Alberta.
As they were getting ready to welcome customers again, they used the wage subsidy to rehire 15 employees.
and they got a loan through the Canada emergency business account so they could buy personal protective equipment, Plexiglas screens and additional hand washing stations to comply with public health guidelines.
That's good news for people who are now back on the job and for locals who missed their favourite neighbourhood spot.
When this crisis first began, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight.
They didn't know how they were going to feed their families or pay their bills.
So our government responded rapidly and substantially to support Canadians with programs like the Canada emergency response benefit and the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
Three months later we're going to see across the country that we're now in a place where we'regradually and safely starting to reopen parts of the economy, buti'm not going to sugar coat it. We still have a long journey ahead.
Some sectors will bounce back more quickly than others.
Many workers will be able to find work, but others won't. Over the past few months, Canadians have been able to count on the Canada emergency response benefit to help them get through a tough time, and the reality is that even as we start to reopen, a lot of people still need this support to pay their bills while they look for work.
That's why today I AM announcing that we will be extending eligibility for the CERB by eight weeks.
So if you've been getting the CERB and you still can't work because you're unable to find a job or it's just not possible, you will keep getting that $2, 000 a month.
Over the next few weeks, our government will look at international best practices and monitor the economy and the progression of the virus to see what changes, if any, need to be made to the program so that more people are properly supported.
But I want to be very clear withcanadians.
Our goal here is to make sure that the CERB is working for you in the best way possible.
Our government will continue to be there for you.
This pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our country, and we're going to make sure that all of our supports, including the Canada emergency wage subsidy and employment insurance are working effectively to get Canadians back on their feet.
That's also a big part of the reason why I proposed to give the provinces and territories $14 billion to make sure that you have child care, that there's testing and tracing, and that your workplace is safe.
As the situation evolves, so too must our response evolve with it, and that's what we're going to keep doing.
[voice of interpreter]since this crisis began, our government began working quicklyto support Canadians with programs such as the emergency response benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.
Three months later we're now in a position to start to graduallyand cautiously reopen the economy, partly because businesses are using programs like the emergency wage subsidy.
But I want to be absolutely honest with you, we still have along way to go in the coming months.
Some sectors will rebound more quickly than others, and many people will find work, but not everyone will.
In recent months, Canadians wereable to rely on the emergency response benefit to get through these tough times, but the reality is that even if some activities are starting up again, a lot of people still need that support to pay their bills as they seek work.
That's why today I AM announcingthat we will be extending eligibility for the emergency response benefit by an additional eight weeks.
That means that if you are receiving the CERB and you cannot return to work because you can't find any work or simply because it just isn't possible right now, you will continue to receive your $2, 000 a month.
In the coming weeks, our government will be looking at international best practices, as well as monitoring the economy and the progression of the virus, to determine whether we need to make other changes to the program to provide more support to people.
But I want to be perfectly clearwith Canadians, our goal is to ensure that the CERB works for you.
Our government will continue to be there for you.
The pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for our country, and we want to ensure that all supports, including theemergency wage subsidy and employment insurance, are there to help Canadians get back on their feet.
We want to give you the support that you deserve during this turbulent time, and in fact that's one of the reasons why proposed to give the provinces and territories some $14 billionso that you have the child care services that you need, so that we can increase testing and contact tracing, and so that youcan return to work safely.
The situation continues to evolve, and our response must also evolve, and that's what ourgovernment will continue to do. [ end of interpretation ]I want to close this morning with some news regarding the Canada-United States border.
I can now confirm that Canada and the United States have once again agreed to extend by 30 days, until July 21, the currentmeasures in place along our border.
This is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe.
[voice of interpreter]I just want to close today with news that the Canada-United States borderwill -- that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by 30 days until July 21 the measures currently in place at the border.
This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19. On that note, I'm now ready to take your questions.
