Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?

For questions, please press star1.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Many legal experts say that one concrete thing that your government could do to reduce the harms caused to black and indigenous communities would be to remove all mandatory minimum sentences in the criminal code.
Will your government make this commitment?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

That is certainly one of the clear recommendations that is coming out.
There's a clear message today from the parliamentary black caucus to that effect, and we'regoing to continue to look at that and other measures that we can move forward to make sure that our justice system does not continue to be unfair towards racialized Canadians and indigenous Canadians.
[voice of interpreter]removing mandatory minimum sentences is certainly one way of moving forward, and we are currently looking at that and other measures to ensure that our justice system is fair to all racialized and indigenous Canadians.

Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

and Prime Minister, Mexico has halted sending upwards of 5, 000 additional workers to Canada until it has assurances that there will be closer monitoring of health and safety rules and until there's abetter grasp of what went so wrong.
What will you do to address their concerns?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I spoke with president Lopez just a couple of days ago.
We touched on this topic.
I shared My sympathies and condolences to the families of the Mexican workers who passed away here in Canada.
We are also, as a country, pre-occupied with what has happened.
We are going to make sure that we are following up not just with our partners around the world but with Canadians to ensure that we know what happened and we make sure that we're keeping all workers in Canada safe.
[voice of interpreter]I had an opportunity to speak topresident lopez abrador a coupleof days ago, and we talked specifically about that, and I told him that we would be working very hard to ensure the safety of all workers, includingtemporary workers.

**Reporter**:

Thank you, good morning, Prime Minister.
With respect to the CERB, I understand there will be no additional restrictions, but last week you were talking about legislation to remove the CERB from people who are able to work.
Why this about-face?



Well, we have proposed a bill that was going to allow for a more consistent attestation that people were seeking work, but we decided to move forward with regulations or the recommendation that people continue to seek work.
We want people to get back to work if there is work there for them, but we also know that there are 3 million people out there who want to work but cannot.
The economy is slowly starting to reopen, and many people would like to work, but they simply will not be able to do so. So we will continue to be there for them while seeking other ways of encouraging people who can return to work to do so. [ end of interpretation ]we knew that moving forward withour bill would give us further measures to encourage people andto, you know, make sure that people were taking work when it came up. We're still looking at ways to encourage people to look for work and to make sure that they are taking jobs that become available.
The reality is that there are 3 million people out of work who are looking for work, and even as our economy is reopening, there are many, many more peopleout of work willing to work thanthere are jobs available, and that will be the story for the coming weeks as well.
So we're going to keep encouraging people to take jobs.
We've seen with the job numbers that many, many people have beenreturning to work from all income ranges, but we know there's more to do, and we will keep working on it. [voice of interpreter]



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

But what is there in this extension that would encourage people who can work to return to work? and how much will this new extension cost?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, we know that with the kind of unemployment we're seeing now people who would like to work and cannot work because there simply are not enough jobs out there.
The economic recovery is coming, but it won't be quick enough to ensure that everyone who wants to work can find a job.
So we need to extend the CERB so that people who can't work because they can't find a job or because they are looking after loved ones infected with COVID-19 will have money to be able to pay their rent and groceries.

Thank you, Merci.
Next question, Toronto star," line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Just returning to the statement from the parliamentary black caucus, have you had a chance to read through it? I see that it's been signed by an umber of supporters, including some of your cabinet ministers.
Should we take that as a signal that you're willing to move on this stuff? or will you commit to fulfilling the list of demands that we see in that statement?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I've said many times we are committed to moving forward on a huge range of measures.
We're working with communities.
We're working with leaders like members of the parliamentary black caucus to identify what exactly we need to move forward first in priority on, but I think it's really important that we all come forward and look at bold ideas that we can take on very soon to fix the systemic discrimination that continues to exist in our country.
[voice of interpreter]I think it's important to continue to be listening and work with parliamentary leaders, including the parliamentary black caucus, to ensure that we are ambitious enough to finally put an end to systemic discrimination that exists rightacross our country in all our institutions.
So as I said, we will be moving forward with concrete steps, andwe are working with all our allies and partners to determinein what order and what exactly we will do first.
[ end of interpretation ]



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

The treasury board website's data published on the website shows the RCMP spending has gone up by 32% since the year you took power, which is about $900 million in spending.
So I'm wondering if you can tell us why that budget has gone up so much and if you're looking at as that statement you just discussed, called for, looking at reallocating some of that funding to different programs.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are always going to make sure that money invested in keeping Canadians safe is spent exactly the right way.
We took office at a time where the previous government had made budgetary cuts to a range of law enforcement and security services, and therefore we needed to make sure that there was an ability to continue to keep Canadians safe.
But at the same time, I think what we've seen over these past weeks and what we've heard from black, racialized and indigenouscanadians very clearly, not just over the past weeks, but over years, means that we do have to look at budgets.
We do have to look at allocation of funds.
We do have to look at how we're making sure that community supports, community programs, grassroots organizations and various support programs are also properly funded.
[voice of interpreter]I think it's important to ensurethat spending on the security and safety of Canadians is done properly, and we will be lookingat budgets so that we are sure to invest in things that help Canadians.
If we need more investments in some front-line programs, for example, or community programs, or other initiatives to move forward, then we will do whatever we need to do to provide that support.
[no interpretation]



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
We are told today there will be an extension by eight weeks of the CERB rather than what happened previously.
is this something you can do by regulation? but last week you tried a different process to modify the CERB.
Why have you decided to wait for those negotiations that really didn't work out to finally signal that you will be extending the CERB?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, within that bill there was a more extensive attestation that would have been required that would have forced people to be actively seeking work.
This is something we needed to do based on that bill.
Now since that bill did not pass, we had to find some other way of encouraging people to seek employment.
But it's important to remember the situation we find ourselves in now.
There are millions of people out there who would like to get back to work but cannot because the jobs simply aren't there at thistime.
So those people who want to work but cannot work don't have employment, well, you know, they need support.
and that's why we will be extending the emergency response benefit for an additional eight weeks.



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Yes, as a follow-up, Canadians who were waiting for this announcement and have been waiting for it forseveral weeks and didn't know exactly what was going to happenin July, I mean, they now know that you could have proceeded byregulation.
So how do you explain the fact that this took so long?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, the Canada emergency response benefit was intended to go ahead until July, and now we are saying that it will not stop, it will be extended for an additional two months which will reassure people and encourage them to get a job if there are jobs in their communities.



**Reporter**:

Radio-Canada.
a question on CERB.
It wasn't clear how much will this cost, the first three months cost $43 billion.
Can we make the same calculationand assume that the extension will cost two thirds of that? is that the right calculation? do you have an idea of the cost?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Well, as always, we will be sharing with the finance committee detailed figures on this, but our hope is that as the economy reopens fewer and fewer people will need the CERB.
We have already seen people who were on the CERB in May leave that benefit in June.
and that's a positive movement, and we hope to see that continue.
There are a lot of businesses who are re-hiring their workers thanks to the wage subsidy, and we hope that that will cost less, but we'll be able to provide more detailed projections soon.



**Reporter**:

Now there are -- onjanuary 8 flight 752 crashed.
There is still many questions out there.
Are the black boxes in France? and five months later, the families are still asking whether light will be shed on what happened.
What do you say to those families today?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We continue to work on this in spite of the pandemic, in spite of -- we know about the terrible disaster that occurred with flight 752.
Minister -- former Minister Ralph goo dale has been dealing with this issue.
I told you I spoke to the president of Ukraine a few days ago where we discussed that, and we continue to work together on it. The black boxes are supposed to be sent to France soon, but Iran's explaining that because of COVID-19 they cannot do it. We are continuing to pressure Iran because we need answers.
We know that we need justice to be done for those families that lost their loved ones, and we continue to work on that.
[ end of interpretation ]we know that there are still families reeling from the terrible loss of the iran air takedown.
We know that there's a lot more work to do. The black boxes have been promised to be transferred to france, but iran is saying that they can't do it right now because of COVID-19. Obviously even though there's a pandemic we're continuing to work on this issue.
I spoke with president zlenski of ukraine a couple of days ago where this issue was discussed.
We're going to continue to put pressure on the iranian regime, alongside our international partners, to get answers, to getjustice, to get compensation forthe families, and this is something we've committed to do and we will continue to do. The honourable ralph goodale is leading these efforts for canadaand continues to be closely engaged on it.



**Reporter**:

is your government willing to do what's needed to allow the Canadian cities to be part of the hub for the NHL to continue to play? and when will that decision be made?



We have indicated that we are comfortable with moving forward on an NHL hub in one of three Canadian cities that are asking for it. Obviously the decision needs to be made by the NHL and the cities and provinces in the jurisdiction.
But Canada is open to it as long as it is okay by the local health authorities.
[voice of interpreter]I know that this is a decision that is going to be made by local and provincial authorities in the three cities who would like to have the nhl play this summer.
But this is a decision that willbe made by the nhl, and the federal government is open to that going forward.

**Reporter**:

The black parliamentary caucus has a number of economic measures that they are specifically asking for help in the COVID-19 recovery for black-owned businesses, as well as more work from the government to include businessesowned by black Canadians in procurement.
Are you ready to commit to thosethings specifically going forward?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Many of these things are things that we're already working on along with the liberal black caucus, so yes we know that there are significant economic measures that have been brought to the fore by this pandemic that were already existing challenges, and the success of black-owned businesses, black entrepreneurs and young black professionals has been something that I've hadmany discussions on over the past couple of years with members of the black community in Canada.
and we will be moving forward ona number of those recommendations.
[voice of interpreter]we know that this pandemic has highlighted the challenges, the economic challenges facing blackcanadians, and we will continue to work with the community on economic measures, on investments and partnerships andprograms to help young entrepreneurs and youth to succeed.
In My last round table with the black community in toronto and montreal over the last year I have often heard the -- about the economic barriers that are amajor problem.
We are already working on programs, and we will obviously expedite that process.

**Reporter**:

The vote on the UN security council seat is coming up. You've been speaking to your fellow leaders and lobbying hard.
I'm wondering how you're feeling about Canada's chances going into this vote?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As I've said from the beginning, getting a seat on the UN security council for Canada is not an end in itself.
It's a means to an end.
It's a way for Canada to continue to be influential and have an impact in multilateral ism and around the world.
Over the past number of months, whether it's been on COVID-19, whether it's been on development and financial reform, whether it's been on climate change, whether it's been on a range of things from peacekeeping to security to women, we have been moving forward and leading the way.
We will continue to do that.
What we've done over the past months, yes, has been talking about the security council, but also looking for ways concretely where Canada can be more engage don the world stage, and regardless of what happens in the campaign, we are more engaged and we will continue to be more engaged on the world stage.
[voice of interpreter]as I've said right from the verybeginning, a seat on the un security council is not an end in itself for Canada.
It's a means of continuing to have a positive impact on the world projecting our values, supporting multilateralism at a time when mutual support and coordination between the countries of the world has become even more important.
and Canada is leading, whether it's on COVID-19, whether it's on funding international institutions or developing countries, or countries in various regions, whether it's fighting climate change or working on peacekeeping and other operations.
The fact is that Canada is very engaged on the international stage, and that will continue.
We do hope to secure that seat in the elections held in the coming days, but whatever the result, Canada will continue to use all means remaining involvedand engaged and having a positive impact on the world.

**Reporter**:

-- just to follow-up on our pitch for a seat at the united nations security council, the pitch from a year ago seems to be somewhat different than what we're makingnow, and I'm wondering if you can talk to us about how the pandemic has influenced and has changed what you're saying to members of the united nations security council vote?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think one of the things that we've seen through this pandemic is just how interconnected and interdependent the world is. You can take it in the positive and the negative.
Obviously the interconnections have left us more vulnerable to economic shocks and more vulnerable to spreads of virus, but at the same time, that resilience that we're able to do by leaning on each other, the multiple supply chains that we can create, the establishment of common rules and approaches around things like trade, around things like health approaches, around coordinating international travel is more important than ever.
Now is a time for us to reflect on our multilateral institution sand how they can be improved given this crisis in the 21st century.
Many of our multilateral institutions were created 70, 75years ago following the tremendous shock and upheaval of world war ii and those institutions have served us well as a world over the past many decades.
But this crisis is an opportunity for us to re-think them and to think about what is truly needed, to make sure that we have a fairer, more just world, to make sure that the most vulnerable within our countries and around the world are better supported, better protected and given better opportunities.
and at this moment, the ability for countries to convene together, to pull together different voices is more important than ever before.
and Canada, by dint of having a seat at the g7 table, g20 table, the commonwealth, the francophonie, the organization of american states and many other different multilateral tables has always been able to pull people together and move forward concretely, and right now as we look at the kind of world we're going to come out ofpost-COVID-19, we need a country like Canada that is big enough to make a difference but small enough to know we can't do it alone and we will continue to work together.
[voice of interpreter]I think that over the years Canada has shown just how much we know it's important to work in a coordinated fashion around the world, but this crisis has highlighted the fact that that collaboration is now more important than ever.
We are more interconnected and, therefore, we must show resilience and creativity in theway we work together as we redefine international relationsand multilateralism.
Canada has shown an ability to be a strong voice for many organizations and many countriesaround the world because of our presence in the g7, the g20, thecommonwealth, the francophonie, opec and the organization of american states.
It's a way of bringing voices together and looking at the future with optimism and creativity to see what kind of world we want to build for the future.
Canada is big enough to make a difference but small enough to know that we can't do everythingon our own, so this is a time when leadership on the part of countries like Canada will be extremely important on the worldstage.

**Reporter**:

You spoke earlier about temporary foreign workers from Mexico coming here and contracting COVID-19, and you said you were looking at measures to make it safer.
I'm wondering what specifically are you going to do to make sure it is safer for temporary foreign workers to come here to Canada.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that there are many issues from living conditions to the fact that they are tied individually to particular companies or employers to various challenges around labour standards that require looking at, and we can even look at things like pathways towards citizenship that could give people more rights.
We rely on temporary foreign workers for a large part of our agricultural production in this Canada -- in this country, but we should always take advantage of moments of crisis to reflect on can we change the system to do betr, better for Canadians, but also better by the people who come here and make sure we stay fed.
[voice of interpreter]I think we need to reflect on how we can better protect temporary workers, whether it's the working conditions or their work permits, and at the same time we know that in this crisiswe have a chance to think about how we can reimagine a system where we rely on temporary foreign workers in order to ensure that our agricultural industry operates properly.
Other changes we can make, yes, we are looking at that now.

**Reporter**:

For 16 months a Canadian author has been arbitrarily detained in a crowded Egyptian prison.
Will you make a personal appeal to the president to release him, and what challenges does your government face bringing somebody home who may have COVID-19?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

First of all, we have continued to get consular support and access.
It's something that government takes very seriously, the health and safety of Canadians detainedabroad, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that they are properly treated and eventually, if possible, brought home.
At the same time, the question of ensuring safe return because of COVID-19 is always an issue, but we have measures around quarantine, measures around safety protocols in place that means that that wouldn't be a barrier if this individual were to be able to return home.
Thank you.
