# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Whether it's to cover the bills, to keep people on the payroll or make rent on a storefront, many Canadians need a hand right now.
We have brought in programs that are meant to help.
Take the wage subsidy and what it means for eriline in oakville.
This family had to close and layoff staff.
It was a tough spring.
When they applied for the wage subsidy, they were able to rehire their entire team.
That matters to the 22 people who now have their paycheque again.
To all employers, please use the wage subsidy if you haven't already.
This help is designed for you and your employees and if you need more support, apply for thecanada emergency business account.
On the Cebu in particular, I want to remind people that we expanded the eligibility on this program to include more small businesses like farmers.
The new application process will open on Friday and in the coming days we will have more information to share.
For now you can go to EDC Ca for information and the documents you need to apply.
In the last few weeks, things have started to look up for a lot of people, but that said, far too many people are struggling.
If you're having trouble finding job, you shouldn't worry if you're going to hit your limit.
Right now we're looking to extend the benefit for people who can't return to work.
We'll have more details later, but for today we'll continue to be there for you and your family.
 

[voice of interpreter] in recent weeks, things have started to improve for many people.
Having said that, we know that far too many Canadians are having trouble at this time.
If you're having trouble finding job, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of benefits.
We are currently looking for a solution in order to extend the benefit period for people who are unable to return to work now because of the pandemic.
We will have additional details for you this week, but for the time being, I want you to know that we will be there for you and your family.
In that connection, I also want to at that moment to recognize all the public servants who have been working very hard for weeks to ensure Canadians can receive the emergency response benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.
This is national public servantsweek.


[end of translation] I want to thank all the men and women who work incredibly hard to get Canadians the help they need, especially recently they have done a remarkable job for their fellow Canadians.
No one could have predicted that this spring would have turned out the way that it did.
Certainly for farmers who keep our grocery stores stocked and our families fed, it's been an unexpectedly challenging few months.
With restaurants and hotels closed for weeks, many producers were left with extra food they couldn't sell.
Farmers work hard to raise their livestock and grow their crops.
They shouldn't be in a position where they see that wasted.
That's why today we are opening applications for the surplus food rescue program.
This will help get food they can't sell, seafood, poultry and otherwise to communities that need it. People across the country will benefit, including in remote northern communities.
This is a win-win.
Farmers will have people to buy their goods and food will get to the plates of families who wouldn't have enough otherwise.
 

[voice of interpreter] today we are opening the application for the surplus food program.
Because of the pandemic, many producers are not able to sell part of their produce.
They work hard to grow their crops and it would be too bad towaste twat food.
Under that program, we will be buying that surplus food to distribute it to people who needit.
This is a win-win solution.
Farmers have a market for their products.


[end of translation] in many ways COVID-19 is a challenge like we've never dealt with before, but it certainly isn't the only test we're facing.
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world we need to think outside the box to keep people safe and to shape the future for the better.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to be an incredibly powerful force for good, but it must be used responsibly and ethically.
Canada is leading the way forward.
Today as one of 13 founding members, Canada helped launch the global partnership on artificial intelligence.
As part of this initial, we haveworked with the government of Quebec to set up a centre for expertise which will be one of the two global hubs.
This is home of some of the mostinnovative people.
 

[voice of interpreter] today Canada is participating in the launch of the global partnership on artificial intelligence as one of the 13 founding members.
Under this initiative, we have also been working with the government of Quebec to create in montreal one of the two centres of expertise that are part of the partnership.
Canadians are among the most innovative people in the world and are pioneers in many technologies related to a. I. we want to make use of that expertise.


[end of translation] earlier this morning I joined Minister ng on trade, safeguarding international supply chains, andon building a global economy that works for everyone.
Now, more than ever, it is vitalthat we collaborate across borders to keep our economies strong and our citizens safe.
This pandemic is a global crisisand it requires global solutions.
In response to a request from the united nations, I can also announce that Canada will provide air-lift support for urgently needed medical and humanitarian supplies.
Through this mission, we will bedelivering help to some of the world's most vulnerable people.
 

[voice of interpreter] this morning I would also like to underscore that today is world elder abuse awareness day.
Our parents, grandparents, and seniors built our country.
We have to protect them and makesure they receive the care they deserve.
Whether you decide to call your grandparents or to get some newsfrom your neighbours, we can alldo our part.
In My riding of Papineau, the m. E. is doing a great job of preventing abuse of elders throughout the year.
I want to recognize all those working in similar organizationsright across the country.
Thank you for taking care of ourseniors.
Today and every single day we have to work together to ensure the health and safety of Canadians of all ages.


[end of translation] our parents, grandparents, and our elders built this country, and we all have a part to play in keeping them safe.
On that note, let me give a shout out to the rogers foundation for their $60 milliondonation to help those most vulnerable in this pandemic.
I know this initiative will havean impact on many peoples' lives.
Speaking of people who make a difference, I want to end by mentioning the troops that arrived in ukraine to resume their mission, the work to builda more secure country is incredibly important.
I know all Canadians will be thinking of these brave women and children in uniform as they serve overseas.
