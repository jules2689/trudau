# News before the Speech



Minister Justin Trudeau.
In addition to his usual update on the government's COVID-19 measures, the Prime Minister will speak about that latest military report on some of the hard-hit long-term care centres in this country.
The Quebec government just released the report that they received from the canadian forces on those 25 homes in their province where forces have been assisting staff.
It comes, of course, just a day after another military report in Ontario exposed what armed forces members say they witnessed, that five facilities in that province -- some startling and shocking revelations there.
Residents force fed, living in extremely dirty conditions, insect infestation and allegations of neglect and abuse.
All of it very difficult to hear, even for people who have been following the state of long-term care centres in this country throughout the past number of years.
My colleagues, the cbc's david Cochrane and the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos, are both here.
We're told two minutes until the Prime Minister will emerge from Rideau cottage.
We just got the 60-page come that the Quebec government got from the canadian armed forces.
It is much larger because they are in 25 centres in that province.
So, just bigger because of that.
I will say I've had a sort of cursory scan of it and it does not appear to have anywhere near the kind of dire situation and observations we saw in that Ontario report yesterday.
There's certainly descriptions of a lack of P.P.E. In some locations, of the improper use of P.P.E. For instance, people wearing n-95 masks on multiple occasions.
There seems to be staffing problems across the board, which is not surprising given that the canadian forces were there in the first place.
Infection rates that are hard to get under control, COVID-19 -- positive COVID-19 patients not in a zone all to themselves.
Some reports of narcotics gone missing, medical equipment gone missing.
But really not to the standards, not anywhere near what we saw in Ontario.
Ok. The Prime Minister is here now.
Let's listen to him far while.
