# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

In recent weeks, members of Canadian armed forces have been helping out in long-term care facilities and seniors homes in Quebec and Ontario.
Ontario and Quebec have asked us to extend the army's mission.
As I said yesterday, our government is currently discussing that with them.
Our members are doing an outstanding job to help our grandparents, our parents and our seniors during this crisis and I want to thank them.
This is not an easy job or an easy situation to handle.
This morning the government of Quebec made public a report produced by our members where they raise a number of serious issues.
a number of the observations in the report such as inadequate staff are among the reasons why premier legault asked for the armed forces to provide support a month and a half ago.
These are serious issues that deserve to be brought to the attention of Quebec and we passed on the report to them last evening.
I also spoke to premier legault earlier this morning and I reiterated our support.
and tomorrow evening, I intend to raise the issue of conditions in seniors homes and long-term care facilities when I have My weekly call with the premiers of the provinces and territories.



Prime Minister Trudeau's raising on what's happening in nursing homes and long-term care facilities with the premiers during our weekly call.
I will once again offer our government's support as they try to get the situation under control.
As I've said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for seniors.
They raised us. They built this country.
They deserve better.
During the first few weeks of crisis, people's lives were turned upside down.
Hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost their jobs, through no fault of their own, without warning because of this pandemic.
. it put enormous financial pressure on everyone from students to young professionals to families.
So, we brought in the Canada emergency response benefit to support people until they're able to get back to work.
and to help as many Canadians as possible keep their jobs or get hired, we introduced the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
We also unveiled our $9 billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months.
We now have over 45, 000 jobs available for young people.
If you or someone you know is interested, go to jobbank.
Ca to apply.
Now, as provinces and territories restart some activities and many people head back to work, fewer people will need the help of the CERB.
But the wage subsidy will continue to be there to support Canadians and make sure they can get paid their salaries.
Maintaining the connection between employer and employee is key not just to helping people get back on their feet, but to keeping our economy strong.
That's why it's so important that employers take advantage of this programme and rehire workers.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

In the first few weeks of the crisis, people's lives were turned upside down.
Overnight, hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs because of the pandemic.
This placed a lot of pressure on families, young professionals, students and many, many more.
So we brought in the Canadian emergency benefit to support people until they could return to work and to allow even more people to keep their jobs or to be hired we set up the emergency wage subsidy.
We also unveiled a $9 billion plan to help students get through the next few months.
More than 45, 000 job offers for young people have been posted on the government's website.
In order to apply, go to jobbank.
GCC.
Ca. We're starting to see activities start up again in the provinces and territories and that means that people will have less and less need for the emergency benefit.
The emergency wage subsidy, however, will continue to be there to help Canadians during the recovery and ensure that employees are receiving suitable pay.
Maintaining the connection between employers and employees will also help us to ensure that the economy is strong.
If you are an employer or a business owner and you have not yet applied, I invite you to go to the Canada revenue agency's website to do so. I've been saying from the beginning that, in order to come out of this crisis, everyone must do their part.
To save lives, people must continue to practice physical distancing.
To get the economy back on its feet.
People have to work and businesses must have customers.
So, if you are an employer, do rehire your employees.
Our government can and will help you.
I will now take your questions.
