About new government measures to support scientists and researchers in this country in the ongoing global race to develop the vaccine against COVID-19. We'll also, of course, following all the developments in Nova Scotia.
Four days after now the massacre there.
CBC news has obtained audio recordings from fire and ambulance scanners and in case you haven't heard them, they reveal a frantic, chaotic situation as emergency res ponders were trying to figure out just what was unfolding.
But let me turn now to My colleagues -- well, that is not My colleague.
There you go, that is the front door of the Prime Minister's house, Rideau cottage, where he will emerge in about 15 minutes' time and to set up his daily briefing and what we might expect, let me bring in the host of "power & politics", Vassy kapelos and Catherine Cullen.
Good to see you both.
There was a significant announcement yesterday in relation to students, $9 billion total.
I keep asking people inside government have we run out of things to announce or run out of money yet.
and it would seem the answer is no. Because this is supposed to be another fairly significant announcement today, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
Another significant announcement with another significant price tag.
My understanding is it will focus, as you pointed ed out, rosey, on science and specifically research behind developing some kind of treatment and/or a vaccine for COVID-19. a significant chunk of change.
All together the government has already announced about over $200 million, I think $248 million towards this.
They will add $750 million, bringing the total amount invested in this kind of research to around $1 billion.
They'll also develop what I'm being told is a task force focused on immunity.
So, the idea of seralogical testing and that it has been approved in the United States, but it hasn't yet.
It's going through the process here.
That is the antibody testing that will be able to tell us through a blood test if we had it or not.
It is also what's so incredibly central to the idea of re-opening the economy or loosening restrictions.
We've heard from premier scott moe and I know he is coming up later today to reveal exactly what his plan is for Saskatchewan.
We just heard from opposition leader, conservative party leader Andrew Scheer, who says he wants the federal government to release a plan on how to re-open the economy or loosen those restrictions by next week.
Guidelines at least for that.
Central to even the concept or the possibility of doing that all is testing.
and we have been talk about that for weeks.
That kind of testing, figuring out who has immunity, who doesn't, what communities have it, what geographic areas have it. That is what I'm told the task force will focus on and it will be led by Dr. David naylor, who had a lot to figuring out what happened during sars and a significant medical figure in this country.
So, an announcement very much geared to developing a plan to re-open things and to restart things.
But obviously through signs.



**Marcy**:

Right.
--



**Rosemary**:

Right.
and Dr. Baylor wrote that federal response with SARS and he was the first to recommend the creation of the public agency and chief public health officer.
That was a turning noinlt many ways for Canada in terms of how it's done.
I'll turn to Catherine with some of what Vassy touched on there.
That is the re-opening piece of this and we'll take that press conference from premier moe live on cbc news network.
It will be significant.
We know that this is an ongoing conversation between ottawa and the provinces, catherine.
Who will do it first? and all the things they have to think about in relation to that



**Reporter**:

and you talk about Saskatchewan leading the pack on this discussion.
and I think probably in part that has a lot to do with the picture in Saskatchewan, the fact that they have not been as hard hit as Quebec, which I'd like to talk about in a moment.
But we have a bit of a sense of what premier Moe is going to talk about today.
He outlined last night this is going to be a five-phase approach.
We know there is still going to be some measures that he says have to remain in place.
For instance, a ban on large gatherings, restrictions on travel.
Concerns about seniors homes.
But specifically what this will look like, people across Canada, outside of Saskatchewan, will be watching with interest.
At the same time, Quebec is having a very live discussion about what re-opening there might look like, but in terms of the COVID-19 outbreak, very different.
In particular, they are dealing with not only a problem in terms of the scale of the outbreak, but specifically in their long-term care homes.
The world health organization, for instancingsinger, and I know it is an organization that is being critiqued but they have put out six guidelines for what any society or jurisdiction needs to in order to re-open.
Any outbreak in special circumstances, like long-term care home, be under control.
When we look at what is happening in Quebec and Ontario, I think there is some very serious questions about that.
We know that yesterday we heard from premiers of both of those provinces, Ontario and Quebec, asking for help from the armed forces, just to get enough manpower, people power, in order to keep these homes functioning to serve basic needs.
Quebec has put a call out within the province asking people for help.
The premier there had a hard time making that two-week commitment to one facility.
All of that forms the picture of what needs to happen.
Some of the news we're getting today about testing and working on that, but also questions about dealing with some of these outbreaks as well.



**Rosemary**:

I should say yesterday Dr. Tam was asked how many tests should we be at? we're doing about 20, 000 a day right now.
and nationally we have the capacity for 60, 000 a day.
We have a long way to go in terms of reaching that capacity.
Vassy, before I get to an interview, I'll quickly ask you your take on that dynamic between Ottawa and the provinces and particularly given today.
We will hear more about how at least one province wants to handle the re-opening.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, I think it is something to watch over the coming days.
We've seen south of the border there is already emerging a very patchwork effect t. Federal government there has released guidelines, but it seems that states have a lot of leverage, obviously given jurisdictional issues about how fast they want to open up. But the risk and what the scientists and doctors have continually pointed out to us is that if you do re-open too quickly, we are expecting subsequent ways.
They're supposed to be smaller but there is nothing saying that they won't be bigger and we've seen evidence of that in some other countries who, at firsthand ld things really well, and then saw mini break outs and increases in numbers and thinking of south korea Kr singapore.
So, it is a kind of worrying thing.
It's understandable, of course, that provinces that are seeing success at this point want to talk about reviving the economy.
People are hurting in very real ways financially for sure.
It will be interesting to see, though, what is the dynamic between the provinces and the federal government.
Does the federal government come up with a set of guidelines, a set of metrics by which, you know, each province has to meet a certain number of tests or certain level of immunity in order to be able to offer some kind of phased approach.
So far we haven't seen the federal government be too interventionist on any of that.
But also we're just starting to see provinces talk about what that may look like.
Certainly something to watch for in the comes days and I have a feeling, given the number of provinces that are seeing fewer cases, the issue will percolate and be there sooner rather than later.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
Ok. While we wait for the Prime Minister to come outside of his home at Rideau cottage, Catherine talked about the long-term care homes.
They have become the frontline of the pandemic in this province and in Quebec.
The province is asking for military support.
Many of the residents in these facilities are older Canadians.
But not all of them.
Jonathan maschon has muscular distrophy and lives in a long-term residence where there aren't any COVID-19 cases so far.
He is president of assist, a nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities and he join me now.
Good to see you, jonathan.



**Reporter**:

Good to see you.



**Rosemary**:

I know you were on "power & politics" last week, but I found your story and what you were saying very compelling.
So I wanted to make sure people saw and heard from you at a time like this.
Tell me what you are worried about right now if there are no cases of COVID-19 where you are currently living.



**Caller**:

Well, I fear for My life, to be honest.
Because here the virus is a threat, but the lack of [inaudible] is a real threat.
Once there is a break out, there is a breakdown in all the services and it is not a safe environment.
What I want is to get out of here with the assistance I need.
and I want to ensure My own safety.



**Rosemary**:

What is preventing that from happening? I would imagine.
and having the staff and people that you need to do that.



Yeah.
Well, the government is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep me here in a long-term care facility.
What I'm asking is part of that money to be able to hire and manage the care and how I want to live.
That is something that can be done very quickly.
This is something throughout the country.
Prison are asked to release some inmates.
Some people who live in long-term care facilities should have the option to get up with their support that they need.



**Rosemary**:

The Minister of public safety, bill Blair, has just tweeted that he will send in the army, the military, into Ontario to long-term care.
There's been about 125 people deployed into Quebec.
What does it tell us, jonathan, about the state of long-term care inside Quebec if that is where we're at, that that's the kind of help that is needed?



Well, it is a total failure from the government to do anything, really.
They have maybe a month to do things.
All they did was to [inaudible] and they went back on that as well, like a week ago.
So, to me, the whole idea that it is a good idea to force people to live in long-term care facilities is a dangerous proposition and we need to have the choice and the right to live in a community in Canada.
Often people are forced to live in those place.



**Rosemary**:

You and I are the same age.
You're 43. So, you're a young guy with muscular distrophy.
How is your help in terms of making you vulnerable, in particular, to COVID-19, beyond the fact that you are in the long-term care centre?



Well t virus -- I don't want to catch it. I don't think anyone wants to catch it. If I catch it, the -- they will put me in the e. R., in an I. C.u. Somewhere.
It is going to be very complicated because I use a tracheotomy and [inaudible] are exposed.
So it's quite complicated.
and as I said, the major threat is that I need 24-hour assistance.
I always need someone not too far from me. So if there is no workers, for example that is a great threat to My life.
Even now, they can't even provide me with the assistance I need.
I almost died many times in the last 10 years.
and they are doing nothing.
What I need is personal assistance.
and it exists in British Columbia, in Manitoba, in United States and europe.
There is no reason why we can't have alternatives to institutionalization.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
and I know that is something that you have been advocating for a long time, long before the pan democratic.
-- pandemic.
You're a strong person.
But are you scared? do you have moments that you're very fearful in a way you haven't been before?



Yeah.
Yeah.
Lots of hopelessness, I'd say.
and I've got nothing to look forward to. You know? what's the plan? if I stay here and I ride this crisis and I come out alive, then what? I'm condemned to live here the rest of My life? I want a future.
Like everyone else.
I want to contribute to Canadian society.
I want to be able to work.
I want to be able to live with My partner.
But it's impossible in this place.
So I want to get out as soon as possible.



**Rosemary**:

Have you seen a sdmaing you -- change? have you alluded to you haven't seen the care you need now.
Are there employees not showing up for work because they are concerned? what can you tell me about that?



There is a shortage of staff.
It's been like that and that is very dangerous for everyone involved, including the workers.
That is why we're calling on them now.
I think in the medium and long-term, we need to stop putting people in long-term care facilities and we need to be able to get out, you know, we can't expect to do the same thing and expect different results.
We need to transition to another way of doing things.



**Rosemary**:

People mostly have their parents, much older Canadians, inside long-term care centres.
I'm not sure we think or talk enough about people of a different age who have a lot of physical demands and who are in the centres.
What would you like? the Prime Minister , who we're waiting for right now, the Quebec, not just people nearing tends of their lives.
This is always people, younger people who have much a life left to live now, too.



Yeah, in Quebec, particularly we're invisible.
We're now considered and don't talk about us. It's like we don't exist.
At first I acknowledge our existence and second, respect our human rights to live in the community and participate in society.
Stop excluding us. and it must become a right to live in the community in Canada and to be included in Canadian society.



**Rosemary**:

and so for now, no cases in the place that you're living and you are just going to do what, wait and see? or how is this going to play out for you?



I will fight to get out of here and that is the only way I'll be able to be safe and I'll continue -- I'm going to continue to give the media interviews and all the resources are on the table.
I will not stop until I'm released, until I prove that there is [inaudible] and I [inaudible] to get out.



**Rosemary**:

You certainly make a good case for it, Jonathan.
I do appreciate you making time again to talk with CBC and, listen, I wish you the best with this case that you are making but also I wish you continued good health inside the home and I hope it stays healthy there for you as well.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Merci.beaucoup.
Of course, as we've been talking about the situation for long-term care centres has become really an epicenter across the country, but very particularly in Quebec and in Ontario.
Yesterday, we saw the premier of Quebec, franÇois legault, mention that he may need as many as 1, 000 military soldiers to come into the province to help inside those centres.
The premier of Ontario, doug ford, made a similar plea yesterday and then followed through with an official request with bill blair who says, indeed t federal government will respond to those needs.
It usually takes them a little bit of time to figure out where the needs are and where the people need to go. Undoubtedly, that request will also come from Quebec.
Because they are really struggling in containing anything, in helping fight the pandemic inside these places.
and in finding enough employees to look after people like jonathan and other older Canadians who are inside these facilities, who need various degrees of care.
I'll bring in My colleagues again.
The Prime Minister probablying coming out in just a moment.
I know you talked to jonathan last week, Vassy.
It's a very moving story n part because he -- it is a long-term fight that he's having, obviously.
In Quebec, the situation is much different, but it is exacerbated by COVID-19 and the fact that he knows that he is very vulnerable to the pandemic, inside that centre in particular.



**Vassy**:

His story really stuck with me. I'm glad you highlighted it today.
I think the word that stayed with me was "powless" -- "powerless" and I can't imagine how much of an advocate he is to feel powerless in that situation and for that sense to be exacerbated so dramatically right now because of the situation with COVID-19. That first question you asked him for me underscores the nation.
We have long-term care systems which house our most vulnerable citizens.
Sit and we had to call the army in. The army had to be called in in order to deal with this situation.
I think that is a question, as a society and different levels of government we will probably be asking ourselves for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Just quickly as we wait for the Prime Minister would add the federal government has offered a set of voluntary guidelines.
They talked about topping up wages for people who work in these homes.
One of big things we heard from jonathan and others who live there is they are chronically understaffed and for those who do staff them, they are chronically underpaid.
The federal government has said they're working with provinces in order to top up wages for people who earn less than $2500 a month.
The Minister of employment said yesterday that those talks, according to the finance Minister, are going well.
She could not offer at this point a timeline for when exactly that top-up would dmik or how exactly it would work depending on the province in which you live.
That will be significant information.
I feel like I keep saying it, but time is of the essence, right? as this continues to almost spiral out of control, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, staffing issues and the ability to deal with it inside the setting, are of the utmost importance.



**Rosemary**:

and there are numbers on long-term care.
132 facilities have reported at least one case.
516 residents have died so far due to infection and more than 2, 000 residents have tested positive.
More than 1, 000 staff positive.
That's the other part.
As staff, of course, become sick, they can't come into the long-term care centre anymore.
They have been replaced, presumably some of those people can be replaced by some sort of basic help from the military.
But not everyone because these are specialized jobs as well.
Catherine, I'll turn to you.
I know that the Prime Minister will be talking to premiers again tomorrow.
Good to know that there are inroads but isn't there yet.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
This conversation did make me think of something that I know you seized on before in these specials, which is something that Dr. Tam has said which is that she believes that one of the legacies of this outbreak is going to be some changes to how things work in our long-term care facilities.
That is something that all Canadians hope obviously and seems trite to say this, but it is terrible that it's taken this to provoke these kinds of changes.
It was interest because the language the Prime Minister was using yesterday and I believe the word he used was v*em vulnerability.
The vulnerability not just of the people who live in these facilities, but also the vulnerability of the people who work there.
Their economic vulnerability which speaks again to the prospect of this top-up to keep people working in those facilities.
This is a situation going on many days now.
There were a lot of questions about how it was going to work and how it would be distributed, whether or not there would be a financial requirement on the part of the provinces, whether they had to match money coming from ottawa and as Vassy says, this is all being sorted out right now.
Meanwhile, we see the situations continuing to deteriorate in some of these facilities.
They need help from the canadian forces and now Minister blair says that particular request has been aproved.



**Rosemary**:

Right.
We'll see exactly what Quebec is asking for and how he responds but right now here's the Prime Minister.
Let's listen in live.
