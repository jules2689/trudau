### Summary:


Across the country, Muslim Canadians are on the front line in the fight against COVID-19 as nurses, doctors and essential workers.
With acts of kindness and donations, people are standing with familis who are grieving and tomorrow with the virtual vigil, we will all have the chance to show the people of Nova Scotia that they are not alone.
When it comes to COVID-19, what we're doing is working.
We're putting in place an additional $1.1 billion for a national medical and research strategy to address COVID-19.
Research on vaccines and other treatments, supports for clinical trials and expanding national testing and modeling.
Under this plan, we're investing close to $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities across the country.
This is on top of the funding we've already provided to support vaccine development in Canada.
The second pillar of the plan is to make sure that once we have potential vaccines and treatments, we can test a wide range of options.
Under this plan, we will invest over $662 million for clinical trials led My Canada.
For these drugs will take months to develop, test, fabricate, and roll out. We're investing $350 million to expand national testing and modeling of COVID-19. This includes creating the COVID-19 immunity task force.
Canada's best and brightest will be working on serology testing, blood testing, to track and understand immunity to COVID-19. They'll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we've already tested have had COVID-19, whether you're immune once you've had it and, if so, how long it lasts.
Over two years, we will be testing one million Canadians as a part of this study.
The findings of the research will help with everything from roll out of a potential vaccine to determining which public health measures are most effective going forward.
We will get valuable data, including disaggregated data to understands the impact on vulnerable populations and we'll also leverage new and existing lab capacity through research.
The better we understand this virus, its spread and its impact on different people, the better we can fight it and eventually defeat it. While this vital research is happening, we're also staying focused on what we can do right now to control COVID-19 and a get back to normal as soon as possible.
Testing is key.
We've now reached 20, 000 tests daily, almost double where we were earlier this month.
But testing must increase even further before we can reohm and restart our normal activities as a country.
