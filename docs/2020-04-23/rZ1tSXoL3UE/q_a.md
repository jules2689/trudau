Thank you, Merci.
First question, huffing ton post.
Your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning.
Yesterday, you said you were going to continue working with finance department and business association to ensure that small businesses would get the support they need.
Many self-employed individuals feel like they have been forgoten but can apply for interest-free loans because they have no payroll and many have thousands of dollars in fixed costs every month so the CERB changes do nothing for them.
They feel that your government has been more focused on employers and employees and many face the possibility of losing their businesses and going bankrupt.
Can you tell us what changes you are envisioning for them?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we said, from the very beginning, we worked on measures to help as many people as possible.
We brought in targeted measures to help people who lost a paycheque, including people who were self-employed.
We moved forward with a wage subsidy that ensures that people who can, can remao*in connected to their jobs while receiving 75% of their paycheque up to $847 a week.
We know that these are measures that got out quickly and are broad and are helping millions of Canadians.
But we also know that there are people who are falling through the crabsing.
That is why we continue to work with industry groups, with stakeholders, with M.P.s and community members across the country who are giving us possible solution and of course we're working with an extraordinary public service to deliver those solutions to Canadians.



**Reporter**:

Ok. That's your answer.
Do you regret this patchwork approach regarding the CERB? it's clear that the need is a lot greater than the government anticipated it drew up the programme weeks ago and I know there are a number of people in your caucus who feel it would have been far easier and would have been far easier to give everyone who's lost income to opportunity to earn income the ability to apply for help and tax it back from those who perhaps didn't need it as much next year.
Did you national convention right call and are you so stuck on this current course of action that you will not deviate from it?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we knew from the very beginning that targeted support to people who needed it was the best way to do it and that is why we moved forward with the Canada emergency response benefit.
But delivered benefits to over eight million Canadians.
Why we moved forward with the Canada emergency wage six did that is ensuring that people can stay connected to their workplace even if they're not actually doing the work anymore.
So that we can bounce back quickly.
But every step of the way, we said we will continue to expand.
We will continue to fill gaps.
We never expected that we'd get it perfect from day one.
Indeed, we knew we wouldn't. But we couldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
We needed to get thing out as best we could, as quickly as we could to help as many people as possible and then we continue every day to make further announcements that fill gaps, that explain how we're going to help those people who aren't hit by a broad measure to help.
and we're making sure that everyone who needs help gets it.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to come back to the announcement you made yesterday on students.
Right now there is a lack of staff in long-term care homes and they're also concerned about that happening in the agricultural sector and some people are worried that this will be a disincentive for young people to go and work in sectors that are opening up soon, such as the retail sector, which doesn't offer very high salaries.
What do you think of that? do you think the generosity of your measures could lead to a lack of appropriate numbers of staff? well, students need help and we know that COVID-19 is hitting every generation very hard.
So, we have to be there to help.
We introduce ed a programme that will develop jobs for young people across the country.
76, 000 new jobs in targeted sectors that will benefit from the help of young people.
I know the youth of this country and I know that they will want to be part of the solution.
I know that they will want to help and contribute to the economic recovery in their own way.
and I think that ensuring that they have the money necessary to cover their rent or pay for their groceries or to be able to ensure they go back to school in the fall is the right thing to doage we will be working together to be sure that we achieve the necessary recovery.
But I won't apologize for supporting our students in these difficult times.
and as a subquestion, some observers have been proposing that ottawa create a programmestomy -- programmes similar to the agricultural jobs programme.
We know that they don't have enough foreign workers at the point.
and they are not necessarily well-paid jobs either.
Do you think that is an interesting job and if not, why? every year we see young people who are interested in working in the agricultural industry or going back to the land and they're a very green generation and very much interested in everything that is organic or agricultural in nature.
So, I know that there are a lot of young people who will be interested in that and I will be new opportunities for them and we will be creating new incentives to direct them to these industries.
I have great confidence in our programme and I know it will be a solution in the midst of this crisis.



**Operator**:

Thank you, Merci.
Next question, the "national post". your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'm wondering, there are a number of United States states that are starting to ease restrictions opening up businesses again, starting as early as tomorrow.
I'm wondering if you're concerned about jurisdictions that are so close to Canada easing their restrictions so much, even whilst in some cases the virus numbers are still going up?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have strong border maeshlgs in place.
This is to ensure that we're dwhaog we need to do to protect Canada.
As provinces look at their own situation and how we can move forward on beginning to re-open our exhibitioner I know that their decision and our decisions will be informed by what is working and what is perhaps not working as well elsewhere in the world.




**Interpreter**:

I know that we'll continue to have measures in place to protect our borders, to ensure that we can ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.
I know the provinces and the federal government are reflecting on the different steps in terms of re-opening and firing up the economy again.
So we'll look at what has worked and what has not worked in other jurisdictions in order to make the right decisions.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
I'm also wondering about the federation of Canadians [inaudible] was out today with a request for $10 billion in emergency funding because their revenues have fallen so steeply during this crisis.
Are you starting to work with municipalities on a package for something like that?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we recognize that levels of government across the country are facing distinct challenges.
We had a number of conversations with the provinces on their financial challenges and, as we know, municipalitis are governed by the provinces.
We'll continue to work with the province and continue to work with municipalities to make sure that Canadians get the services they need and support they need.
Regardless of the orders of government.
We all serve Canadians and we need to work together to be there for them.




**Interpreter**:

We will always be there for Canadians who need services and support during these difficult times.
We respect the province's areas of jurisdiction with respect to the municipalities and we will continue to work with the provinces on the municipalities issue and in some cases directly with the municipalities when it is appropriate.



Operator?

Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'd like to come back to the assistance provided to Quebec in care homes.
Are we talking about 1, 000 soldiers being sent in as was requested? and you are talk about lessons to be drawn.
With represent to Quebec, what was not done properly in that eh er because, for years, we've been talk about problems in these long-term care homes.
First of all with respect to the request for assistance, as we responded positively to the first three requests from Quebec, we will, of course, be responding positively to this one as well and we are currently working with Quebec to sigh exactly how we can provide the best possible support.
We received that request last evening so we're working with them now to co-ordinate the best possible response in terms of numbers and locations.
Regarding the lessons we have to draw from the current situation there will be many important questions to look at and find answers to in the coming weeks and months.
As to how we can better support the seniors of this country.
and I think that this crisis has brought home the fact there are challenges that we have to meet all together.
Follow-up? so, as I understand it, you haven't yet set the number of soldiers that will be going in? and a number of days ago, you talked about sending in volunteers and the contribution of the red cross.
How many additional individuals could come from those groups? well, I can tell you we will be there to help.
People are facing a terrible situation and we will be there to help Quebec take control of the situation.
It's extremely troubling and terribly unfortunate and we will be there with the military.
We already 350 military personnel on the ground in long-term care homes across Quebec.
We will be sending more and we will be working with Quebec and will helps with volunteers, with the red cross.
We will do everything we can and we'll be there for each other.
That is what we do as Canadians.
We're there for each other in a crisis.
So, we will be there.
This time.

Molly Thomas, CTV national news.
The race for personal protective supplies allows for a way out of china.
Are you any closer to getting Michael savor and Michael kovrig released? when was the last time they had a chance to meet with consular officials?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we have been working extremely diligently on the issue of michael spavov and michael kovig who have been detained for over 500 days in china.
This is something we'ves taken seriously from are the very beginning.
I can highlight that the Minister of foreign affairs spoke to his counterpart, you know, very recently.
To express our continued concerns and desire to see them released soon.
The COVID-19 crisis has the chinese system in a position of not allowing consular visits.
But we have been assured that they are in a facility and region that is not particularly effective by COVID-19. Although we are continuing to press both for more details and for better access.



**Reporter**:

Also, we've seen a spike in anti-asian violence in different parts of our country.
In British Columbia, an elderly man with dementia was shoved out of a store by an asill aren't -- asill -- assailant with remarks to COVID-19. What is your message to Canadians as they see this?



Prime Minister Trudeau's intolerance and racism have no place in our country.
Canada has succeeded because of our diversity.
It is one of our greatest strengths.
and the millions of Canadians of all different backgrounds who are working together, many, many of them on the front lines to help their fellow Canadians deserve better than this from all of us. We need to continue in our resolve to be an open, welcoming, respectful country and I think all Canadians expect that of every politician.



**Interpreter**:

Intolerance and racism have no place in Canada and certainly not in our public discourse.
Our country is strong not in spite of those differences, but thanks to those differences.
There are people with different histories and backgrounds and origins who are workinging to, side by side, to fight COVID-19. and to help their loved once and their fellow citizens.
So during these times, we have to United States.
We have to come together and not accept intolerance.



**Reporter**:

With one meat packing plant already closed in Alberta, and the n. D.p. In that province calling on two more to be shut down, I'm just wondering what is the federal government doing to protect Canada's food supply from the effects of COVID-19 and are you worry worried about federal inspectors going into these plants?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we are very alert to the issue of food supply in Canada and food security for Canadians is a continued essential priority.
We will work with the agricultural industry.
We are strengthening processes around the cfib to ensure both protection for our inspectors and effectiveness in assuring the safety of our food supply and of the conditions in which workers find themselves.
We will continue to work with provinces and various jurisdictions to ensure that we are making sure that Canadians go et Te food that they need.



**Reporter**:

In terms of vaccines, you announced funds for vaccine development.
I'm wondering if your plan is to have vaccines manufactured here in Canada for Canadians.



Prime Minister Trudeau's we know that developing vaccines is an important step and that is why there are brilliant researchers working across the country in coordination and in collaboration with the international community as we all make efforts to develop a vaccine.
But once we developed a vaccine, whether it be in Canada and a elsewhere around the world, we'll need to produce it. and we will see the same kinds of pressures that we're seeing around obtaining P.P.E. Around the world to obtain vaccines, which is why part of the investments we're making today is to establish the capacity of developing vaccines and producing vaccines.




Interpreter:



**Interpreter**:

Vaccination will be a critical part of our ability to fight COVID-19 and that is why we're investing in research so that Canadians can be part of the research effort to find a vaccine.
At the same time, we need to ensure that we can produce those vaccines here in Canada.
and that is exactly what we intend to do. Mr. Trudeau, Quebec is starting to talk about possible re-opening of certain region and I believe that Saskatchewan will also be unveiling its own plan to do the same.
Some people are talking about mid may to re-opening certain businesses.
Do you think it's too soon? do you think the provinces are moving too quickly? well, I think everyone wants to know when we're going to be able to lift certain restrictions and perhaps return to a seminormal life.
But obviouslily, until we have an actual vaccine, we cannot talk about a normal life.
We can relax certain measures, if appropriate.
But while at the same time, remaining vigilant and doing a lot of testing.
Various provinces are at various stages of the fight against COVID-19. and they will be making appropriate decisions and at the federal level, we are trying to co-ordinate and ensure that we are moving forward based on the same shared principles so that we have a common approach to the measures that will be brought into place across the country.
and the time that they're going to be introduced.
Of course, that will vary from province province.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that everyone wants to know when this is going to be over, when we will be able to get back to normal life.
Until we have either a vaccine or significant treatments for COVID-19, we won't be able to talk about getting back to normal.
But in the coming months, we will be able to Laotian and number of the restrictions and rules that we have right now on personal abilities, in certain sectors, on the economy.
Different provinces are in very different postures related to COVID-19 and we'll be taking decisions that are appropriate for them.
What we're doing at the federal level is attempting to pull together and co-ordinate all different provinces so that we are working from a similar set of guidelines and principles to ensure that Canadians right across the country are being kept safe.
As we look to those next steps.



**Interpreter**:

Earlier, you said that we're conducting approximately 20, 000 tests a day now, but it is not enough.
What is your target so we can start talking about re-opening the economy, based on testing? well, Dr. Tam has talked about 50, 000 to 60, 000 tests a day as an important target.
Other people are saying that it could go -- could be as much as double that number.
I know that we're doing much more now and that is why we're also increasing our testing and our testing capacity at this time.



**Reporter**:

Julie van dusen, CBC.
You talked about that it is unacceptable about what's going on at seniors home and discussed the idea of making sure that people make more money in those homes.
Of course, that would be a short term solution.
In terms of a long-term solution, will you be talking to the premiers about putting seniors homes under the Canada health act a, which would set national standards and hopefully make sure that seniors don't go through such a terrible ordeal again.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There are going to be an awful lot of Canadians asking questions of all their politicians, about what we're going to do to make sure a situation like this could never happen again.
What COVID-19 has done has highlighted and brought forward feelings in the our system, in our country where, the people who take care of our most vulnerable are extremely vulnerable economically.
We need to do better and there will be a lot of conversations that Canadians will demand and that politicians will have about what is the best way to ensure that we're properly protecting our elders.



**Reporter**:

On the issue of a vaccine, which you said in the past could take year to 18 months, will we have to wait for a vaccine to hug our family and friends who are outside of our bubble?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The process of re-opening the level of freedom we'll have to wait friends and to work and to go outside will depend on the decisions and the advice that scientists give us around how to keep ourselfs safe.
We know it may be a long while before a vaccine.
There are discussions around treatments for COVID-19 that might work as well as a vaccine.
We've been waiting for and looking for and searching for a vaccine for aids for decades now and still hasn't come.
But there are treatments that mean quality of life for people with h. I.v. Have been massively improved.
There are different ways of moving through.
We will take the best ways we possibly can as we move forward.
a vaccine obviously arriving soon would be the best solution but we need to make sure we're exploring all different ways of ensuring that Canadians' quality of life and safety and protection is upheld in the best way we possibly can going doer ward.
Merci.beaucoup.
