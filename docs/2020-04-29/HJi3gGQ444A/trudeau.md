# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Normally students are anxious to see the month of may arrive.
Classes are over and there are only a few exams, and you're anxious to start your new summer job and spend more time with your friends, but this year is different.
The pandemic is creating a lot of instability and uncertainty for many people, including youngpeople.
Some people who are about to graduate were not able to take fully -- full advantage of the last semester, and now they're having trouble entering the job market.
Those who are still in school are facing similar obstacles.
a number of things have been cancelled, and there are many of you out there who are wondering what you're going to do in the coming months and how you're going to be able to pay your tuition for the coming year.
So last week we unveiled a $9 billion plan to help you to get through this crisis.
First of all, we announced the Canada emergency student benefit which will provide $1250 a month to students during the summer.
and if you have a disability, you will be receiving more.
At the same time, we are investing to create 76, 000 additional jobs for students in those sectors that need a hand or are actively contributing to the fight against COVID-19. These jobs can be added to those that are also available under the Canada summer jobs program.
[ end of interpretation ]. -- but want to contribute in thefight against COVID-19, we're going to make sure you have support too.
Students helping in the fight against COVID-19 this summer will soon be eligible for $1, 000to $5, 000 through the new canadastudent service grant for volunteer hours.
We're also going to be providingspecific support for first nations, inuit and metis nation students.
For graduate students and those connecting research, we're goingto extend scholarships, fellowships and grants so your work can continue.
and we're doubling student grants for low- and middle-income students for 2020-2021.
Taken together, our government has a $9 billion plan to help students and recent grads get through the next few months.
Since we introduced this plan, we've been working with the opposition parties on legislation that will get this help to young people as quickly as possible.
I'll be heading to parliament shortly where we will introduce a bill to put the Canada emergency student benefit in place.
[ speaking french ] [ voice of interpreter ]. the last few weeks have been difficult for everyone, and our government is taking action to help you during this crisis.
To help parents, we will be improving the Canada child benefit in May.
After the closure of schools, parents became teachers, restauranteurs and music teachers.
Our solution is hard for families, and we are helping them with the Canada child benefit, and to support people of low-income, our government will be introducing the gst credit.
I also increases the gst credit.
If you have to pay taxes, you have until August to make your payment [ end of interpretation ]. the pandemic has been hard on everyone, and that's why our government is stepping up to support you.
For parents who have their handsfull these days, our government will be boosting the ccb paymentin may, and to help low-income Canadians, we supplemented the gst credit.
I also want to remind everyone that this year, if you owe income tax, you have until August to hake your payment.
Yesterday Minister hajdu and Dr. Tam provided an update on our latest modelling, and the good news is that Canadians are stepping up to keep each other safe.
In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened, so we have to keep itup.
We're seeing some progress because people from coast to coast to coast are making sacrifices and following public health rules, so let's stick to it. Let's stay home, wash our hands and when we go out let's say 2 metres away from others.
Starting this weekend in Nova Scotia, the canadian forces snowbirds will head across Canada to salute Canadians doingtheir part to stop the spread ofcovid-19. As we watch the snowbirds fly over our homes, let's remember that we are all in this together.
Happy to take your questions now.
