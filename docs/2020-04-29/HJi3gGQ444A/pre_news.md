# News before the Speech



Pandemic.
He's expected to start at 11 eastern, it's a little bit earlier than usual today, any moment now.
The Prime Minister will be talking about the government's proposed $9 billion aid package that is to assist students in this country.
It comes a day after there was virtual very large committee meeting, almost 300 MPs were virtually dialled in yesterday on a zoom call to ask questions of the Prime Minister and other ministers.
Today, though, the Prime Minister will go to the house ofcommons, as will other leaders, opposition leaders, to deal with this piece of legislation directly.
We expect the Prime Minister to have to leave this press conference at around 11:30, in fact, to make his way to the house which sits as of noon eastern.
Should say that this government aid package that the Prime Minister will speak more about in just moments, there are questions around concerns and even some real criticism from the opposition parties about it. The conservatives and the bloc, and the NDP all saying that it is in many ways not enough for students.
The conservatives call it a disincentive for some students to seek out work at a time when there are businesses experiencing labour shortages.
So we're going to take a closer look at what other parties are saying about it and whether the government will have to make some tweaks.
Here now the Prime Minister of Canada.
