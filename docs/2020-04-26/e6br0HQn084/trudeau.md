# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I wanted to thank the organizers of yesterday's vigil for the victims of the Nova Scotia shooting.
The pandemic has prevented us from gathering together, but we found a way to support the lives of the victims and their families.
It was an extremely moving tribute and just yet another example of how Canadians are there for each other in difficult times.
Once again, My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims.
This week our government announced for support for Canadians going through an especially hard time because of COVID-19. With the Canada emergency support fund we are giving more money to charities and non-profits so they can continuetheir important work.
We also unveiled a $9 billion tohelp students get through the next months.
Because of COVID-19 there aren'tas many jobs for students.
Without a job, it can be hard topay for tuition or the day-to-day benefits.
We launched the Canada emergencystudent benefit which gives students $1, 250 a month from mayto August.
At the same time, we're creating76, 000 jobs for young people in sectors that need an extra hand right now or are on the frontline of the pandemic.
If students choose to volunteer and fight against COVID-19, theywill be eligible for a $1, 000 grant through the student grant.
 

[voice of interpreter] for small businesses we announced yesterday we had reached agreements with all the provinces and territories to lower by 75% their rent for the month of April, may, and June.
I also want to take this opportunity to remind employers of all sizes that they can apply, starting Monday, to receive the emergency wage subsidy.
In the meantime you can go to the site of the Canada revenue agency to calculate what the subsidy will cover.
Our government is providing helpto meet immediate and urgent needs of both workers and businesses.
At the same time, we are also thinking about what to expect inthe coming months.
We are providing more funding tomedical research on COVID-19 andthe development of a vaccine.
This week we put in place the COVID-19 immunity task force, whose mission will be to trace infection and get a better understanding of how we can become immunized against the virus.


[end of translation] throughout the outbreak our objectives as agovernment have been clear, helpthose who need it most, protect jobs, support the small businesses that make our communities better placed to call home, and lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back once this crisis is over.
In the past few weeks our government introduced a series of measures to do just that, butwe know there are more people tohelp, more work to be done.
Today we're announcing $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors through this crisis.
As we fight COVID-19, people whowork in fish and seafood processing plants across the country are playing a crucial role when it comes to getting food to our tables.
This funding will help ensure that they can safely continue their important work.
We're giving more money to processors so they can purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to support protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
For example, fish processing plants could buy new equipment such as freezers or storage space so that their product, food for Canadians, can stay good while they respond to a changing market.
With this announcement we're giving fish and seafood processors more resources to adapt to the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, and above all keep workers safe.
Our fish sector is interconnected.
So these investments will also have a positive impact on fish harvesters.
On that note, I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous work that is being done by every person who makes Canada's food production possible, including the fish farmers and processors.
You keep your grocery stores stocked and Canadians fed.
I know this is tough financiallyand emotionally.
I want to thank everything you do for us. You provide an essential servicefor the country.
We know that you have specific needs and asks right now and we are actively exploring additional ways to support you as we move forward.
 

[voice of interpreter] today we are announcing an investment of $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors in this crisis.
People working in that area feedour families every day.
We are investing to allow them to continue their important workin safety.
This is money that processors will be able to use to buy personal protective equipment for their workers, adapt their health protocols, and support other measures such as social distancing.
Fish processing plants will be able to use this money to buy refrigerators or storage space to store their products in orderto sell them later.
Thanks to today's announcement, fish and processing -- fish and seafood processors will have thenecessary resources to face the challenges of this pandemic and to protect the health of their workers.
Because our seafood processing sectors are closely tied, these investments will also be able tohelp fishers.
In fact, I want to take a momentto talk about the incredible work done by all people who workin the food processing industry.
You fill the shelves of our grocery stores with fresh products and I know the recent weeks have been very difficult for you, financially or emotionally.
So thank you for everything you're doing for us. We know that you have special demands and needs and we will continue to look at different ways of helping you.
As I mentioned yesterday, I had a discussion with the premiers of the provinces and territoriesand we talked about gradually reopening the economy.
We are working with public health officers to set out the principles and standards that will serve us all.
The economy and the realities ofeach province are unique, so thetiming and specific measures will be different from one province to another.
That said, there is an importantcoordination work that must be done at the national level to avoid confusion.
We are now establishing a plan based on science, data, and experts' advice that reflects our common ambition to lift thiscountry out of the crisis.
The next phase will be crucial.
If we do not introduce the rightmeasures, we could lose all the progress we've made thus far.
Our discussions are continuing and we will continue to work together to ensure the safety ofall Canadians.


[end of translation] yesterday, I had a call with the first ministers with we talked about putting together a joint statement, outlining what needs to be done to reopen the economy.
We're working together with Canada's chief medical officers to establish guidelines for us all.
We have to be mindful that the realities and challenges for each province are unique, so thetiming and specific measures will be different across jurisdictions.
We need a coordinated approach nationally to avoid any confusion amongst Canadians.
We're working together on a planbased on science, data, and expert advice that lays out our common ambition to get our country through this.
If we don't get this next periodright, we will lose all the progress we have made.
We will keep working together for all Canadians.
Tomorrow there won't be any press conferences either by doctors or by myself, so I want to close today by talking to young Canadians as I do every weekend.
To all the kids watching out there, you're doing great.
Keep helping up around the house.
Keep up with your school work.
Above all, stay positive.
This is a tough time, but we're going to get through this together.
To young people out there, many of you need extra help and we'rehere for you.
This week we announced a series of measures to support you during this crisis, but we need your help too.
This is a moment in our country's history that we will look back on and ask each of ourselves what we did for our community, for our country.
What did we do to serve our country, to help the world.
As you look at what you can do this summer, please remember there are seniors who need your help.
There are frontline workers who could use a hand and there are agricultural farmers and producers who would love to see you step up to feed Canadians.
Look at how you can use your energy, your drive, your vision for making the world a better place and make it so. How we get through this as a country depends on each of us, the choices we make, the actionswe take.
This weekend, stay home, keep washing your hands, and if you need to go out for groceries, keep at least 2 metres apart from each other.
Think about what you can do in the fight against COVID-19 to support our frontline workers tohelp your community.
I know that we will help each other to get through this because that's just who we are as Canadians.
Have a great weekend.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll go to the phone lines for questions, one question and one follow up. Operator.
