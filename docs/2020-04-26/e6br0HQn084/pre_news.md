# News before the Speech



Television, CBC news network, streaming wherever you are in the world on the CBC news app and on CBC News.
Ca. We are standing by to hear from the Prime Minister in his daily update on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some of the provinces are turning to a gradual reopening of the Canadian economy and a loosening of the public health restrictions.
Justin Trudeau spoke about that with the provincial and territorial leaders.
It will be up to each province and territory, but they are now working on some national guidelines being created by both the provinces and the federal government.
The Prime Minister says all those plans will be of course phased in and putting the safety of Canadians first.
We're expecting to hear more about that in 15 minutes.
We're also told that the Prime Minister will focus on another critical part of the economy, the fishing economy.
Many of the fisheries have been closed.
As we wait for the Prime Minister, I want to bring in My colleague Catharine Cullen, who is going to help us with our coverage today.
Let's start with the call between the Prime Minister and the premiers because you were working on as well.
Does there seem to be broad agreement that they can do it all together or the federal government has to take a leadership role? give you your sense.



**Catherine**:

They are going to be working together on this set of guidelines.
We expect them to come out next week.
One province suggesting early next week.
It is important to say these are broad guidelines.
We heard the Prime Minister talking about some of the things they will do. What is an acceptable level of testing, what needs to be for contact tracing.
He talked about levels of safety.
But what those reopening will look like will be up to each province and territory.
We have seen with Saskatchewan and New Brunswick that there are going to be differences from one province to another.
Now in part, obviously, that is going to be because the picture of the outbreak changes from province to province, but they're also going to be looking at different measures.
New Brunswick said immediately people could form what's called two household bubbles.
Your household could choose one other household that you wanted to start interacting with.
This has to be a household that both households are in favour of. On May 4 the first thing they want to allow to happen is medical services, the dentist, optometrist, the physiotherapist.
Both provinces putting an emphasis on outdoor spaces.
We want to see what the federal government is going to be recommending.
Everyone has talked about doing this gradually and proceeding with caution.
What happens when there are outbreaks, questions about the severity of those outbreaks and when will the provinces say they need to pull it back.
Some of the major provinces, Ontario and quÉbec, for instance, talking about laying out their plays in the coming weeks.
We want to be watching for that as well.



**Rosemary**:

There is a lot of excitement in New Brunswick about seeing one other family.
I can totally relate.
It's interesting too that this is not a national picture right across the country, but even inside provinces.
Our colleague mike crawly was talking about the lack of cases in northern Ontario or if Montreal is the epicentre of much of the country and certainly quÉbec, how do you treat it differently inside a province.
That seems more challenging.



**Catherine**:

Indeed.
In quÉbec where they've had to ask for help in northern quÉbec from the front yard.
The island of Montreal, let's talk about long-term care facilities, you have what's happening with the public at large but these facilities are proving to be the majority of the source of deaths in Canada.
The world health organization has set forward six standards that they would like communities, jurisdictions, countries to look at when they look at reopening.
It has to do with, yes, testing and contact tracing.
But one of the things they've said is you can't have outbreaks in long-term care facilities.
How does that fit into the picture of what communities decide to do when they decide toreopen.
Although Ontario and quÉbec are talking about putting forward their plans, in New Brunswick they've taken this first step.
We don't know what the timeline will be when they start moving on these measures.



**Rosemary**:

The Ontario government announced some new emergency measures as well.
They will allow staff to be redeployed into long-term care homes and the military deployed to quÉbec and five long-term care homes in Ontario.
You can see on the side of your screen the Prime Minister's home, Rideau cottage, where he will come out and speak to us. You can see on the trees the Nova Scotia tartan.
They were put there because of the virtual vigil.
Police continue to investigate the mass shooting.
We have learned lots about the 22 victims and lots of details how those tragic events unfoldedover the course of those two days.
Shaina luck joins us outside of RCMP headquarters in dartmouth.
Shaina, what can you tell us about the latest on the investigation?



**Shaina**:

Rosemary, a complicated investigation.
16 different crime scenes, 22 victims.
RCMP headquarters behind me, you can imagine they are working overtime in there today.
We know, as you said, a great deal more today than we did even just a few days ago.
We know a lot about the timeline, where the shooter was, when he was there.
We know this all began with really a terrifying incident of domestic violence.
The very first person who was attacked was the shooter's long-term girlfriend.
She was attacked and forcibly restrained.
Police said the attack was a significant one.
She survived that.
She fled into the woods and stayed in the woods around Portapique for safety.
She didn't emerge until the early hours of Sunday morning.
That's when RCMP found her.
She became a key witness.
She was the one who confirmed he was travelling in a fake RCMP car with an RCMP uniform.
She told them that information so they could get it out to the public.
Before that could happen, he wasable to use that fake car and uniform to really get around theprovince and to kill a great many people.
We're hearing he killed people he knew, but also that he pulledpeople using that fake car and he shot and murdered them on theside of the road.
Some very grizzly details comingout.



**Rosemary**:

I know there is a lot of focus on where the gunman got the car, the decals, the uniform.
This gave him an advantage, if you will, as he went through his24 hours.



**Shaina**:

That's right.
The RCMP have dwelt on what an advantage that was for the shooter to have that car and that uniform so that he essentially did look like an officer.
We know a little bit more about how he was able to get that.
The RCMP have told us that certainly RCMP cars can be bought at auction.
They are commonly sold off.
They would be stripped of any RCMP-identifying information before they are sold off.
So it is possible that the shooter got an old car, but he was able to reconstruct the images that a true RCMP car would have.
RCMP told us yesterday that theybelieve they have tracked down the shop where the shooter bought the light bar on top of the car.
They also say they are looking for the printing shop to do the decals and writing on the car.
That will be a big focus of the investigation going forward.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, Shaina.
That was Shaina luck.
In case you missed it we had an interview with commissioner lucki, in which she said if an emergency alert had been sent out to the residents of Nova Scotia before and earlier, one was never sent, if they had chosen to do that and to reveal that the suspect was travelling in an RCMP car and uniform, that could have made a difference.
That's on our website.



> let's track back to the story we are covering every day at this time, that's the government's response to COVID-19. We talked to Jamal it isn't -- khera.
She herself got COVID-19 and nowshe's recovered.
How are you doing?



**Interview**:

Thanks for having me on the show.
I feel great.
I had full recovery.
The journey was as expected.
It wasn't easy.
I got all COVID-19 symptoms and more, but I'm extremely fortunate because I know there are people going through extremely tough times right now and I want them to know we're thinking of them.
I remain very, very and extremely grateful for the incredible healthcare workers.
The nurses who checked up on me every day and truly got me through this experience.



**Rosemary**:

That's good and it's important to talk to people who have survived this.
a lot of focus is on the deaths, but about a third of cases have been resolved.
People do get it and do get better.
You haven't have to go to hospital.
You were able to stay home and care for yourself.
is that what you did?



**Interview**:

That's right, Rosie.
When I came on your show a month ago that I tested positive.
It started off with mild symptoms and I had good and bad days.
Some days I couldn't get out of bed at all.
I had fever and shivers and coughs.
I also had this rare symptom of a rash all over My body that lasted a few days.
I lost My sense of smell and taste, but I'm fortunate that throughout the whole time I was supported by the public health nurses who checked up on me almost every single day and I'm extremely thankful for their guidelines managing My symptoms and to be completely healthy once again.



**Rosemary**:

You you're right before this happened wanted to lend a hand and you yourself area nurse and you wanted to participate in some telehealth calls helping with people.
What are the plans there?



**Interview**:

When the call to action first came out, that was a no-brainer for me to put My hand up and sign up. I AM on that list and I look forward to contributing on the frontlines.
Being a member of parliament as well as a nurse.



**Rosemary**:

I imagine it was hard to do some of the constituency work over that period, given how ill you were on certain days.



**Interview**:

No, certainly.
It was definitely tough.
I'm thankful for the team and the work we did.
Working from home is that we're actually very productive.
We can get to a lot more constituents as well.
I do miss seeing My constituentsface-to-face, but I think it's really great to see because of technology that I'm able to holdtown halls, connect with the youth council, and do the work that we will eventually be doingwith virtual parliament as well.
I'm very happy with that.
I think I'll say throughout the whole process, that the whole process worked from listening to the recommendations from our public health officials to beingsupported by our public health nurses every step of the way.
I'll continue to encourage Canadians to follow the advice for public health, continue to practice social distancing, and please continue to stay at home.



**Rosemary**:

That's an important message because we are nearing -- now this is more than month of this.
The weather is better.
People are starting to get fatigued by it. Everyone continues to say it is important to follow the rules as they are now and limit your exposure to other people as much as possible.



**Interview**:

Certainly and that's advice that I'm continuing to talk to My constituents about.
I posted a video about the journey I've been through on My COVID-19 experience.
It goes to show, it doesn't matter if you're young or a different gender, you think it'sonly affecting the elderly, but having gone through the experience I can tell you it was extremely hard for me. I have never gone through something like this.
That is why it is so important to continue to make sure we're staying at home and practising physical distancing, and only going out when we absolutely need to. We owe it to our healthcare workers that we stay home so they're safe and we need to do our part staying home.



**Rosemary**:

Jamal khera, good to see you up and about and able to send that personal message from your experience.
Thank you for making the time.



**Interview**:

Thank you, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

That was Jamal khera, the M.P. for brampton west.
There are also a third of peoplewho are recovered.
That is part of the story.
You can get COVID-19 and not be hospitalized and recover at home.
The number of cases tops 43, 000, but we do know that not everyoneis being tested.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
