### Summary:



I wanted to thank the organizers of yesterday's vigil for the victims of the Nova Scotia shooting.
The pandemic has prevented us from gathering together, but we found a way to support the lives of the victims and their families.
This week our government announced for support for Canadians going through an especially hard time because of COVID-19. With the Canada emergency support fund we are giving more money to charities and non-profits so they can continuetheir important work.
Our government is providing helpto meet immediate and urgent needs of both workers and businesses.


[end of translation] throughout the outbreak our objectives as agovernment have been clear, helpthose who need it most, protect jobs, support the small businesses that make our communities better placed to call home, and lay the groundwork for our economy to come roaring back once this crisis is over.
In the past few weeks our government introduced a series of measures to do just that, butwe know there are more people tohelp, more work to be done.
Today we're announcing $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors through this crisis.
As we fight COVID-19, people whowork in fish and seafood processing plants across the country are playing a crucial role when it comes to getting food to our tables.
This funding will help ensure that they can safely continue their important work.
We're giving more money to processors so they can purchase personal protective equipment for workers, adapt to support protocols, and support other social distancing measures.
For example, fish processing plants could buy new equipment such as freezers or storage space so that their product, food for Canadians, can stay good while they respond to a changing market.
With this announcement we're giving fish and seafood processors more resources to adapt to the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, and above all keep workers safe.
On that note, I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous work that is being done by every person who makes Canada's food production possible, including the fish farmers and processors.
We know that you have specific needs and asks right now and we are actively exploring additional ways to support you as we move forward.
 

[voice of interpreter] today we are announcing an investment of $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors in this crisis.
People working in that area feedour families every day.
This is money that processors will be able to use to buy personal protective equipment for their workers, adapt their health protocols, and support other measures such as social distancing.
Fish processing plants will be able to use this money to buy refrigerators or storage space to store their products in orderto sell them later.
Thanks to today's announcement, fish and processing -- fish and seafood processors will have thenecessary resources to face the challenges of this pandemic and to protect the health of their workers.
Because our seafood processing sectors are closely tied, these investments will also be able tohelp fishers.
In fact, I want to take a momentto talk about the incredible work done by all people who workin the food processing industry. We know that you have special demands and needs and we will continue to look at different ways of helping you.
We are working with public health officers to set out the principles and standards that will serve us all.
That said, there is an importantcoordination work that must be done at the national level to avoid confusion.
Our discussions are continuing and we will continue to work together to ensure the safety ofall Canadians.
We're working together with Canada's chief medical officers to establish guidelines for us all.
We're working together on a planbased on science, data, and expert advice that lays out our common ambition to get our country through this.
We will keep working together for all Canadians.
Tomorrow there won't be any press conferences either by doctors or by myself, so I want to close today by talking to young Canadians as I do every weekend.
Keep up with your school work.
This week we announced a series of measures to support you during this crisis, but we need your help too.
There are frontline workers who could use a hand and there are agricultural farmers and producers who would love to see you step up to feed Canadians.
Think about what you can do in the fight against COVID-19 to support our frontline workers tohelp your community.
I know that we will help each other to get through this because that's just who we are as Canadians.
