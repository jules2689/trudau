# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada wrapping up his daily briefing just outside his home of Rideau cottage.
His main announcement about the fishing industry.
Let me bring in Catharine cullento talk about the other pieces.
a lot of it was focused on how to reopen the economy and when to reopen the economy.
An interesting portion that I'm not sure I had been thinking about is how much personal protective equipment do you need for companies in order to be able to do that.
That obviously is an ongoing concern too.



**Catherine**:

Yeah.
I mean, there was so much there to talk about, rosemary.
The Prime Minister did say at one point if there is not enough personal protective equipment for some industries, they just shouldn't reopen, which of course raises the question which industries would this come down and how would the distribution happen.
Getting enough personal protective equipment for front line workers and medical supplies.
David Cochrane has reported on the supply chain that's being built, an air bridge of supplies in china, trying to get that equipment to Canada.
We know about domestic efforts to ramp up production in this country, but obviously the demand would increase greatly as we would hope to see more and more businesses start to reopen and come back online as provinces continue with their reopening.
That's obviously going to be a significant source of discussion.
There were a couple of things that the Prime Minister touched on that I thought were interesting we should talk about the context around.
I was interested when he was asked about this question of community passports.
This is something that Chile in particular is exploring.
This idea if you've had the virus, if you've recovered from COVID-19, that you would get sort of a card that would allow you to go back to work and participate in society let's say as normal, but I think we all understand that normal has changed greatly.
The world health organization came out yesterday saying they don't support that and the science is not there.
The Prime Minister said he doesn't think there are any plans in Canada for that.
The premier of quÉbec has raised quite a lot of interest and in some cases concern when he talked about the prospect of herd immunity and that being part of the plan in gradually bringing school children back in that province, because they seem to be at lower risk of falling seriously ill from exposure to this virus, that over time gradually by bringing children back you would build a herd immunity in society.
That has provoked a lot of discussion, but it's interesting to see the interplay of that idea with what the W.H.O. is saying and the Prime Minister issaying that the science is simply not there.
We do not know that just becauseyou have the antibodies that sayyou have the disease that you are, in fact, immune if you encounter the disease again.
You could be reinfected.



**Rosemary**:

That was interesting because I think he'sright, the science isn't there.
To predicate a policy decision on something that doesn't support it would be strange.
I want you to weigh-in on the long-term care question because there was something bristling inquÉbec when it was suggested this needs to come under the Canada health act.
I'm not sure he said he was pushing that idea away entirely.
It sounds like that is still a conversation he wants to have.



**Catherine**:

It certainly sounded like he was trying to diminish some of the bristling guess we could say.
Yesterday when franÇois legault, the premier of quÉbec, was asked about greater federal intervention when it comes to long-term care facilities, he basically said, back off.
We can manage our own healthcarenetwork.
What we need from the federal government is more money.
We heard frankly an old conversation about healthcare transfers when he talked about these days 23% of quÉbec's healthcare spending is paid for by the federal government.
Back in the old days it used to be a 50/50 split.
It was interesting to hear the Prime Minister saying they want to have those discussions, but those discussions are for later.
What about a second or third wave, do you not need to get thefunding out the door to help with those.
The Prime Minister saying we need to have those discussions.
They will happen later.
I want to mention quickly, rosie, he talked about billions of dollars being allocated for top-ups for essential workers.
We heard this discussion.
The money is allocated, but not out the door.
The conversations with the provinces continue.
That is a particular issue trying to get money to long-termcare homes and their workers.



**Rosemary**:

I'll come back to you.
Now let's get more reaction to the Prime Minister's announcement for $62.5 million to support the industry.
We are joined by Keith bar in bables.
Good to see you, Keith.
Maybe it's good to see Keith.
Okay.
He can't hear me, so we'll try and get that sorted.
It was $62.5 million the Prime Minister announced, but it was for the processing part of the industry.
He did say very clearly in his announcement that we understand you have more specific needs and additional ways to get help and we will discuss that moving forward.
I'm not sure if that pertains to the actual boats that the fishermen and women would go on to go out to do their work, because of course those are very restricted in terms of space whether they're big or large, but it seems the processing plant there looking to give themmoney, for instance, to freeze goods in case the supply chain isn't there.
We know that almost every fishing season has been delayed by two weeks or more in many places in the Atlantic provinces.
That's obviously putting a severe strain on the economy outthere.
While we wait for the federal briefing with federal cabinet ministers and public health officials, it starts at noon eastern.
I'll go back to the cbc's Catharine Cullen, because that'swhere I go when My guests can't hear me on Skype.



**Catherine**:

Let's talk about the announcement.
The Prime Minister did say seafood processors and he talked about the seafood harvesting industry and he said he hopes this money, the $62.5 million, will help the harvester, but he also said there needs to be conversations around how to helpthem.
I thought it was interesting that he mentioned this money going to the Canadian supply.
We know that a lot of seafood is exported and one of the concerns we are hearing from the industry is about the collapse of the markets.
It's part of the reason we've seen them ask for the season to be pushed back is a hope that some of that market returns.
Yes, there are questions about actually processing the food and actually going out and getting the fish.
It's been said many times, but it is self-evident to us even ifwe're not involved in fish harvesting, that there isn't a lot of space on those boats for physical distancing.
One quote saying they sleep so close to each other on these boats that they share the same dreams.
You can imagine how challenging that is. The Prime Minister mentioned thechallenges for those going out on the boats.



**Rosemary**:

We do expect the Minister responsible to be at this briefing.
She can answer questions about where else the support might be needed, as you pointed out.
I'll end on this point, first ofall, the news that the Prime Minister is not going to hold a briefing tomorrow.
One of his days off.
He hasn't had very many.
and doctors won't either.
As he went through the list of things that the government has done in a week, it is a staggering number of policy measures and an amount of money.
At a time when you keep thinking, well, we must have done all the things possible and know there are still gaps to fill, but I'll end with what his message was too.
That was for particularly students who did get a substantive amount of aid this week, $1, 250 per month, it was to think about other ways to help Canadians and get credit and additional funds for that.
I think that is a good place to end because it is something they should be thinking about.
I've only got 30 seconds.



**Catherine**:

I'll note quickly that it's a point of friction inquÉbec in particularly where some of the agricultural folks there are wondering if this will draw students away from their sector.
They are trying to get the students out of their homes and picking up these jobs.



**Rosemary**:

Catharine Cullen, thank you.
You just heard the Prime Minister say there will be no briefing tomorrow.
I'm sure he will be back on Monday.
Today's announcement focused on the fish and seafood processing plants and that part of the industry.
More potential help to come for other parts of that industry.
We know that the Prime Minister and public health officials continuing to say things are going well, but we have to keep up the things that we're doing in terms of physical distancing.
We'll say goodbye to CBC television.
You can continue watching on CBC News network.
[♪♪♪] [ please stand by ]the focus today is combating thevirus in what has become the epicentre in Canada's long-term care homes.
Ontario, now the second provinceto receive military support after quÉbec.
QuÉbec is still waiting for moremilitary support as well as for additional support.
But today the focus of the Prime Minister's briefing, and again we'll hear more about it at noon, was announcement of $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors.
Keith sullivan is the president of the fish food and allied workers.
Good to see you.
Thanks for making the time.



Yes.
Good day.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me what you make of the announcement, $62.5 million, but it's specifically for the processing plants.



First of all, harvesters fro mall Atlantic Canada across to British Columbia have been looking for relief since the pandemic began.
So today obviously, as part of that, it's encouraging.
First thing -- we know that those in the processing sector and in plants have some serious concerns about their health and safety, so it will be important that this money is actually spent to make sure that the proper P.P.E. is there and that workers are protected, because there is serious concerns about being able to distance in these facilities.



**Rosemary**:

For sure.
We've seen outbreaks in beef processing plants, chicken processing plants, so this is an issue because of the restricted working conditions.
However, there isn't seem to be anything here for the people going out on the boats themselves.
The Prime Minister said we know you have more concerns, we're willing to do more.
is there any way to make that work? if you're on a small boat or bigboat, these are tight quarters.
It seems challenging to make sure people have space.



Yes.
The safety does remain the number one concern for everyone in the industry.
As a result of that, harvesters Newfoundland and Labrador had delayed major seasons.
We fish snow crab, lobster, shrimp, millions of pounds of these shellfish.
As a result of the delays and of the market problems related to COVID-19, we're going to have severe difficulties.
There is going to be instances where people just can't make ends meet.
and that's why we've asked for specific things just for harvesters and that was what the prime Minister's announcement missed today.
and we hope there is more to come.



**Rosemary**:

It sounds like there is. What more would you need for theharvesters?



Specifically, you can't harvest when you want.
There is a season.
We've asked to extend employment insurance benefits for harvesters because they may not be able to harvest this year andit's not something you can pick up later in the year.
Fish harvesters have fell through the cracks of the other programmes.
For example, individual harvesters are not eligible for the wage subsidy or loans as other businesses are, so that's an important thing to address for harvesters and a more obvious one would be just waiving fees that individual harvesters paid to federal government, which can be significant.
Thousands of dollars.
and in some cases, tens of thousands of dollars.



**Rosemary**:

Just to go back to the issue of personal safety, public health safety for harvesters, is there an attempt to try and get personal protective equipment that might make it possible for some people to go out, maybe in a limited capacity?



This work has been constant looking at the proper procedure sand best practises to operate Ina COVID-19 environment, looking at what P.P.E. is reasonable.
But we know, it is difficult andin a lot of cases impossible to separate.
So ensuring that you prevent COVID-19 from getting on the vesselis important, for example, in this part of Canada, we've been fortunate to see no new cases.
For example, in seven days.
So I think it really depends on what the greater population is doing as well.
But harvesters, we're certainly happy that those in the fishing industry were cautious and wanted to wait and make sure that they were safe before they start a big industry like the fishery.



**Rosemary**:

Good to get that perspective today.
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it. So that is some reaction immediately to the federal government's decision or announcement today about the fish and seafood processing.
As you heard, though, lots more hoped for by harvesters themselves in the Atlantic provinces primarily, but wherever they may be. We're expecting to see the Minister responsible for fisheries and oceans there, Bernadette Jordan, as well as public health officials.
Let me bring back Catherine Cullen now who is helping our coverage here today.
I think we're also going to hear from Marc miller today, he does sort of a weekly briefing on the situation for indigenous peoples in this country.
and there have been a real push as well to make sure that they have enough P.P.E. In those communities that are already, ofcourse, you know really challenged by perhaps the remoteness of the community, the -- yeah, all those things oreven lack of some basic health care as well.
So there has been a push to do that.
Fortunately, the number of caseshas not been a huge number, although they have seen a numberof deaths.



**Catherine**:

and so, again, we'll expect to hear the update from him today giving us a bit of a better picture what is happening in the communities.
Obviously it's one of the instances when we look at particularly vulnerable communities across the country, that provinces, the federal government, municipalities need to be paying attention to in terms of the outbreak.
Another thing that I did want to seize on from what the Prime Minister said, we haven't discussed it yet, but if it is not of great significance, we should keep an eye on this issue.
Our colleague Ashley Burke asked about the fundraising drive by the European union to raise money for the W.H.O., the Prime Minister did say it's something Canada is looking to participatein.
I think this is significant, it's going to be significant if indeed Canada does put forward additional funding for the W.H.O. We know this has been a real point of contention and concern.
I believe we can see Minister miller there, so maybe we shouldtalk after the briefing.



**Rosemary**:

Good point.
Here's the Minister of indigenous services, Marc miller.
We'll bring that to you live.



The Minister of Nova Scotia has been through a lot and indeed all of Canada, but I want to thank her for being here, because in particular, she is grieving, but we are all grieving and here with you, Bernadette, so I do want to thank you for being here, but again, our hearts are heavy given what has gone on in Nova Scotia over the past week, so thank you.
I think we'll get right to it. Dr. Tam will speak followed by Dr. Njoo, followed by myself anddr.
Wong and then Minister Jordan.



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

Hello, everyone.
Bonjour.
I'll just start with the usual update on the numbers of COVID-19 in Canada.
There are now 44, 364 confirmed cases including 2350 deaths.
To date, labs across Canada have tested almost 670, 000 people with about 7% of these testing positive.
Today marks the start of national immunization awareness week.
As we're now in the midst of a global pandemic, I cannot imagine a more poignant time to talk about the benefits of immunization.
As we reflect on the importance of vaccination this week, I'd like to highlight unsung hero ofvaccines, Dr. Hillman, whose career is an inspiring outline of the era.
He was a virologist, who helped to develop 9 of the 14 vaccines for children today.
Mumps, rubella, chickenpox and other infectious diseases.
His focus on safety and reducingvaccine, Dr. Hill man was the original vaccine fast tracker.
It was this unique ability that enabled him to develop and fast-track in 1957 pandemic influenza vaccine, preventing illness and death in the winter.
There is an urgent need for thisaccelerated process.
and the world is responding in equal force with 20 institutionsand companies working on expedited vaccine development, while over 70 countries are working collectively to accelerate research on treatments.
There is one more lesson from Dr. Hillman we must heed today.
Though a hero who saved hundredsof thousands of lives with vaccines, he never lost sight ofthe millions of lives that couldbe saved with routine vaccination programmes for existing infectious diseases.
For that, he is credited with saving millions of lives, more than any other scientist in the 20th century.
This brings me to My key message.
We are in a pandemic.
To stick to essential activitiesonly.
So My message is that vaccination is an essential activity.
It is normal to feel concerned about visiting a doctors' officeor clinic, but please know that health care providers have precautions in place to prevent the spread of infection, like screening patients before appointments and staggering patient times to maintain socialdistancing.
Contact your health care provider to find out ways to safely make sure your family's vaccinations are kept up to date.
This is a life-saving essential must-do. Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Tam.
Dr. Njoo?



Bonjour.
[voice of interpreter] good afternoon.
I'll start with the latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada.
There are now 44, 364 confirmed cases, including 2350 deaths.
To date, labs across Canada havetested almost 670, 000 people with about 7% of these testing positive.
Today marks the start of the national immunization awareness week.
and we're now in the midst of a global pandemic, I cannot imagine a more poignant time to talk about the benefits of immunization.
As we reflect on the importance of vaccination this week, I'd like to highlight an unsung heroof vaccines, Dr. Maurice hillman, whose career is an inspiring outline of our modern vaccine era.
Dr. Hillman was a virologist andvaccination scientist who helpedto develop 9 of the 14 vaccines that are routinely recommended for children today.
Vaccines that prevent measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, and other infectious diseases.
Known for his focus on safety and reducing vaccine-adverse events, Dr. Hillman was also theoriginal fast-tracker.
This owing to his mastery of thescience of vaccines and the myriad of processes from research through federal regulation and delivery.
It was this unique ability that enabled him to develop and fast-track a 1957 pandemic influenza vaccine preventing untold illness as well as deathsthat winter.
With the COVID-19 pandemic stillin high force, there is an urgent need for this acceleratedprocess focused on delivering a safe, effective vaccine and the world is responding in equal force with 20 institutions and companies that are currently working on expedited vaccine development while over 70 countries are working collectively to accelerate research on treatments.
However, there is one more lesson from Dr. Hillman we must heed today.
Though a hero who saved hundredsof thousands of lives with a pandemic vaccine, Dr. Hillman never lost sight of the millionsof lives that could be saved with routine vaccine programmes for existing infectious diseases.
For that, he is credited with saving millions of lives, more than any other scientist in the 20th century.
This brings Te to our key message today.
We are in a midst a pandemic andwe have all committed to protectourselves and our families through physical distancing to stick essential activities only.
So, My message and our message today is that vaccination is an essential activity.
It is normal to feel concerned about visiting a doctor's officeor clinic at this time, but please know that health care providers have precautions in place in order to prevent the spread of infection, such as screening patients before appointments, and staggering patients' times to maintain social distancing.
Please contact your health care provider to find out ways to safely make sure that your family's vaccinations are kept up to date.
This is a life-saving essential, a must-do. Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Njoo.
[end of translation] good afternoon.
We have seen an increase in the case counts in first nations communities.
As of April 24, there have been 95 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in first nations communities on reserve.
and 14 confirmed cases in nunavik inuvik communities.
[voice of interpreter] the number of casesare low in indigenous communities, but we're followingthis whole pandemic closely.
We're working with public healthauthorities and local authorities to do what we can tomake sure these communities haveall they need.
We also work closely with communities throughout the country to make sure they're always ready to face an increasein the number of cases.
There are a number of immediate actions that can be taken to slow the spread of the virus.
Ones many of us have become familiar with, but are worth repeating.
Namely hand-washing, physical distancing, no larger or even small gatherings, self-isolation, and active identification of symptoms.
We count on indigenous leadership to persist in their efforts to share this message with their communities.
To date we have distributed in addition to supplies provided byprovinces and territories, gowns, half a million gloves andclose to 200, 000 surgical masks in communities.
We also saw positive progress today in terms of our support for urban indigenous populations.
This week, 94 programmes were supported through the indigenouscommunity support fund.
and these programmes support a variety of indigenous measures that help youth, homeless individuals and elders by providing food baskets, child care, mental health supports in urban settings principally.
We're proud to be supporting thefriendship centres as they continue their important work for vulnerable indigenous communities in the face of this pandemic.
We are also working quickly to get the funds out of the door for the 94 accepted submissions and we have streamlined the process so the funds can flow directly to indigenous communities across the country in short order.
We recognize that more support is needed.
As I said before, this should only be viewed as a start of oursupport for urban indigenous populations in particular.
[voice of interpreter] this week the Prime Minister announced $9 billion for post-secondary students as well as increase of $75.2 million to support students in apost-secondary setting.
To support indigenous students as well.
[end of translation] you may be worried about your future.
Whether it's your financial situation, employability or the continuity of your studies.
I want you to know we will make sure you have the financial assistance you need when you need it. This new funding is over and above the base funding each indigenous based programme receives and will cover costs such as sport for living, travel, counselling and other support expenses to ensure the success of indigenous students.
This funding is also over and above the measures announced about by -- by the Prime Minister this week.
They can access supports that fall within the larger response plan, including the Canada emergency student benefit, the new student grant and the loans programme.
[voice of interpreter] I would also like to commend the canadian armed forces rangers in nunavik, in the lower north shore and other regions that support the local communities by distributing food, by helping with medical equipment and by raising awareness to help communities tofight against the COVID-19. [end of translation] between theprovinces and territories, we'reall focused on the public healthresponse that will save lives.
Miigwech.
Mercy thank you.
Dr. Wong?



I would like to acknowledge we're on the traditional territories of the Algonquin people.
[voice of interpreter] there are many waysto stay healthy.
For example, not travelling -- [end of translation] -- is the best way to contain the spread of COVID-19, by keeping at leasttwo arm's length away from otherpeople.
As well, no gatherings or group outings and limiting contact with people at high risk, such as elders and those in poor health.
However, I encourage immunization, physical exercise, and getting onto the land.
Individual harvesting and fishing are excellent ways to connect with culture and supportyour mental health while respecting physical distancing.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Wong.
Minister Jordan?



Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Bonjour.
Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank canadiansfrom coast to coast to coast who have been so wonderfully supporting of Nova Scotia.
This past week has been very difficult for us, but your love, support and condolences have meant a great deal to all of us, so thank you for that.
The women and men who work in Canada's fish and seafood sector are the economic drivers for many of our coastal and rural communities.
They've been feeding Canadians for generations and we need them to continue to do that.
When the industry is strong, everyone does well.
But when it hurts, we all hurt.
[voice of interpreter] when the industry is strong, everyone does well.
and when it hurts, we all hurt.
[end of translation] we've been in contact to understand what they need for a safe, strong season.
One of the concerns is to move product from storage capacity and a market perspective.
Without the ability to move goods efficiently, processors can't buy more from harvesters and in turn they can't supply Canadians with seafood.
Bolstering our seafood sector will be vital in feeding Canadians this season.
So today we're announcing $62.5 million for the new canadian seafood stabilization fund that will go directly to the fish andseafood processing sector.
This will increase inventory capacity, allowing them to process more and field more people.
Retooling to meet the shift in demands and put in place enhanced health and safety measures to minimize the risk toworkers among other things.
We've always said we would adaptour measures as this situation progresses to tackle new challenges and that hasn't changed.
We know this is a difficult time, but our government will behere every step of the way as weweather this storm together.
We're actively exploring other ways to support harvesters in the industry, but today's announcement will provide immediate support to the industry, help ensure access to this important food source and position the sector to return tofull strength once the pandemic is over.
Industry has faced tough times before, but the people who work in our fish and seafood sector are determined and resilient.
I have full confidence we will get through these hard times, too.



Thank you.



Thank you.
Now we'll move on to questions and answers.



Start with three questions on the phone.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?



Thank you.
Once again, please press star 1 at this time this ask a question.
Our first question la presser.
Go ahead, your line is open.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] good afternoon, everyone.
My first question is for Dr. Njoo.
I would like to hear what your position is with regards to passports that have been talked about in recent days, the W.H.O. Has said that there is no evidence that those who have hadcovid-19 are immune to it. What is your position on that matter?



We have to study this idea of creating immunity passports.
Thank you for the question.
The COVID-19 virus is a new one and so we're still learning.
There is a very steep learning curve through science that constantly progresses.
Up to know with what we've seen abroad and with data we've analyzed, we have noted that people who have already been infected with COVID-19 that have created antibodies, but is what is not clear is if they mean immunity and for how long.
There is no evidence up to now that having been infected leads to long-term immunity, so we're not ready to say if anyone has already contracted COVID-19 everything is perfectly fine, nomore malarky, just immunity for life.
This is something to follow up on and we'll continue to examinewhat science and evidence shows us with regards to this.



**Reporter**:

Thank you, Dr. Njoo.
My next question, I don't know if you have an answer.
Yesterday I asked a question to ms. Freeland, where are we with Ontario and quÉbec's request to have military personnel in long-term and senior care homes? do you have any news on that front?



You perhaps heard the Prime Minister's press conference.
Currently we are -- we have sen tin army medics in reconnaissance to figure out what is required over the next few days.
We'll study the matter closely and potentially reevaluate current demands.
Such a process is already under way.
Armed force personnel and medic swill be deployed in quÉbec's -- in quÉbec for this initial reconnaissance.



Thank you, our next question is from Teresa wright with the Canadian press.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Good morning.
I'd like to ask Minister Jordan about the announcement today.
It was specifically focused on fish processors, but fish harvesters, including lobster fishers in the maritime are grappling with the decision about whether to set their traps an incur the considerable costs when it comes to that with no financial package specifically aimed at them.
is there help coming for fish harvesters and will the wage subsidy be expended to lobster fishers for their spring season?



Thanks for the question.
Absolutely the message today is for the processors.
The announcement was to address concerns from the process sector, but we recognize for the harvesters to continue to fish, they have to be able to sell their product.
That's one of the reasons that the processors are the first out the door.
We're active explored other measures that will impact other sectors, other areas of the sector.
We know it's important to listen to harvesters.
We know there has been challenges with them actually accessing the funds that have already been announced.
We're continuing to look at all of these things that need to be done and will continue to followup with new measures as we go forward.



Follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Yes.
Thank you.
Minister miller, several first nations in Canada were dealing with suicide crises before the pandemic started and we know that COVID-19 is only going to have a compound mental health impact on many of first nations, Inuit and met is persons who are suffering from intergenerationaltrauma caused by colonialism.
Why are mental health resources not a bigger part of the pandemic response, especially for indigenous community?



Teresa, as we follow the evolution and the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the portfolios that I AM responsiblefor, we know that the impact on indigenous communities is high on many fronts, including the impact on mental health, a component of which is suicide.
Our teams are working actively with communities to increase the capacity in support for people that are suffering.
This is something that will evolve over time as communities implement the health directives, make sure that they're looking in on each other and we're supporting them in a comprehensive way that we need to do. As you mentioned, COVID-19 has compounding effect on all the pre-existing conditions that indigenous communities are subject to. That is a wide generalization, because these preconditions varyfrom community to community, buton the whole, the social determine ants of health create conditions where COVID-19 has the potential to run rampant.
The anxiety is real and that hasimpact on mental health.
As part of indigenous services Canada, a large amount of the support we provide turns in and around supports around mental health.
Those continue.
But as this epidemic and all theimpact that it can have, particularly on the well-being of peoples, is continually assessed.



You know, we work with indigenous partners to ramp up the implementation of first nations' mental wellness and theinuit strategies.
We are fully behind supporting the efforts in these very tryingtimes.



Thank you, doctor.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
Our next question is from -- please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] thank you.
[end of translation] My questionis for Dr. Tam.
How worried are you about an anti-vax movement in Canada whenit comes to the eventual COVID-19 vaccine? is your department tracking groups, watching social media toprepare to such possibility?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

So as I said, there is a global effort in the discovery and the research on looking at safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19. So that is not a reality as yet and we think it would take some time.
But as a whole, what we want to do is to make sure we get the information out to parents and to Canadians about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccination as a key component of keeping people healthy in Canada.
and we are not immune to the incursions of very contagious pathogens like measles for instance.
So that is something that globally we are quite concerned about after people are coming out of the homes -- physical distancing potentially means there could be outbreaks, so this is why we're asking people to set up appointments, find out how to get vaccinated, even during this time, because it's an essential service.
I think in terms of looking at people who have questions about vaccinations, we'll have answers to the questions based on scientific facts.
Prior to this pandemic, I've been working hard with not just the medical community or paediatrician, but also with parents and parents influences as well as social media platforms to look at how we can address the disinformation and misinformation about vaccinations.
So that will continue.



Follow-up I.



**Reporter**:

Just to make sure, are there any indications that such combat well be necessary to fight against misinformation? and also, Mr. Trudeau addressed the need for a national plan today about reopening the economy.
Do you think we should -- since you know the situation is different from one province to another, would you recommend that we close or we shut down inter provincial travel?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

So just to finish off the first question I think is that we won't really know much about the vaccines until they've been further developed.
We do need to ensure safety and effectiveness.
So I think the key is to communicate those facts.
I can't predict what is going to happen in terms of the uptake for the public, but we will definitely like all immunizationprogrammes, take public education and awareness into account.
It's difficult to say actually because in our experience, you know, even in the middle of a pandemic, like the pandemic of influenza, you can't really tell.
Sometimes it's quite an emotional reaction.
I recall in the last pandemic when you get an increase in death, for example, people will suddenly want to take up the vaccine very, very fast.
When you don't have enough to go around as the vaccination programmes roll out.
Those dynamics we can't actually comment on at the moment, but it's something we're aware of.



I just would add as a society, we have faced a number of challenges of the years with respect to complacency and how vaccines are regarded.
This is also an opportunity to combat that disinformation with awareness as to what the importance of vaccines are.
As we see -- as we see our elders and people in long-term care facilities exceedingly vulnerable and dying in indignadosity, this is also an opportunity to reinforce the point of vaccines.
When you talk about indigenous communities, there is -- there is sometimes a legitimate skepticism with the way the medical services have been provided in the past and variousaccess to medical services, but also the way it is regarded.
So that is an additional hurdle.
We're always fighting this information, but this is an opportunity to raise awareness as to the importance of vaccines.



Thank you, Minister.



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

In terms of the second question, I think we are working very closely with all chief medical officers to look at the conditions upon which some easing of the public health measures should be taken.
So that, I think, forms the foundation of some of the decision-making on what needs to be done.
I think each community has very different needs.
For example, we heard about somecases in northern Saskatchewan and that means protecting those communities are very important.
and so even within a province, so those decisions are taken as a very sort of local and provincial level as well to protect those communities.
and so we need the foundational public health approach, and thenthat needs to be flexibility in terms of protecting communities on the ground.



Good morning, Dr. Tam, ashleyburke CBC news.
Immunity passports and certificates, could it be effective?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

I think the answer is we don't actually knowyet.
So I think just this last few days we talked about the task force and some of the objectives of that task force is to conduct the necessary research in order to help us interpret what serological testing results mean.
So it is a very novel virus.
We don't understand the immunology of this virus very much.
We have idea of the antibody response and some of these responses are quite delayed.
We don't know when the peak of the antibody response might be reached.
We definitely don't know how about the antibody response might last for and what it means if someone is reinfected.
All those are unknown.
The other unknown right now is also the performance of some of the tests.
That's partly related to the understanding of immunology, bu teach test performs differently, so our national biology lab, having evaluated a range of tests, shows that a lot of them are not sensitive or specific enough.
Which means you could, in fact, get false-positives where someone thinks they may have antibodies and they don't, or the lack of false-negatives as well and specificity.
Those are sort of evolving knowledge.
So I think from our perspective if you have a test, what we needto do is do these studies so youknow how to interpret those tests.
It's premature to think about the concept of a passport.



**Reporter**:

I'm hoping you can talk about herd immunity.
QuÉbec's premier said allowing an umber of people to get the virus naturally in quÉbec would be the best develop against a second wave.
Do you recommend this approach to provinces and territories? could it be the new normal?



**Dr. Theresa Tam**:

I think part of the immunity task force is also to have a look at what the level of immunity is in our population.
We actually don't know that.
The number of reported cases is underestimates of the people with the infection.
I think that's the first step.
Given the incredible public health response and the response of Canadians to do the physical distancing, it is possible that the level of immunity is quite low.
What I do know is that while the particular -- this particular virus can have a very devastating impact on seniors, our elders and those with underlying medical conditions, it can result in severe outcome seven for the young and the rest of the population.
So you know, the idea of sort of generating national immunity is actually not something that we -- is not something that I think should be undertaken.
I personally think that, you know, as the chief medical officers, we would be really cautious about that kind of approach.
You never know even as a young person if you might get severely sick and into the I. C.u. So it's not the concept that should be supported.



Rachel Haynes from CTV.
My question is for Dr. Tam.
We're talking a lot about the science behind antibodies, but we also know that a vaccine is what will help us return to the new normal as the prime ministersaid.
How confident are you that a vaccine will actually be effective in combating the spread of this disease?



I think the honest answer is we actually don't know at the moment at all.
I think that there are some promising candidates in very early development.
and because we don't understand the immunology of the virus enough, it is a very premature, you know, thing to even try to come at. One, whether we actually get a vaccine.
and if we do get one, how effective it is. The other thing we don't know is the evolution of the virus.
What will the virus be like in another year? and how will that affect the effect of the vaccines or unknowns? what I AM heartened about is the amount of research that is going into this at the moment.



**Reporter**:

and given that it'stoo premature to even be talking about the effectiveness of it, the Prime Minister has said multi times over the fast few weeks, we will return to normal.
Today we're talking reopening the economy.
is it too soon for that step?



What is really important is to absolutely focus on eliminating this first wave.
It's really, really critical.
and be very, very cautious aboutit.
All of these outbreaks in these high-risk settings must be addressed.
There must be plans to prevent further infections in long-term care homes, in acute care settings, in the crowded living conditions.
That actually has to be in placeas well as the testing strategies, increasing the tests.
So there is a number of conditions upon which I think we can cautiously move to what I would call a new normal.
So we're trying to balance very carefully the public health measures against disease activity.
The moment we're going to see uptick in disease activity, you're going to have to be able to react to that and rapidly contain any of these outbreaks.
So I think as we observe, the epidemiology is quite different across the country.
So there will be differences in the timing, but tread, really, really cautiously, because I think that the chains of transmission will be reignited very rapidly should we don't take absolutely great care as wecome down that slope on the other side of the epidemic curve.



Thank you.
Our next question.
Please go ahead.



Hi there.
My question is for Minister Jordan.
We're hearing concerns here in New Brunswick about the federal government bringing in 150 temporary workers.
Are you facing push back in trying to bring these workers in?



We've heard from the sector how important it is to have the temporary foreign worker.
One of the things we're hearing is to have a secure labour force.
That's why we made temporary foreign worker able to come intocanada we know it's extremely important we have the labour source to keep the food supply chain open.
That's one of the reasons we've allowed this to happen.
It's important in agriculture and the fish and seafood sector.



**Reporter**:

Okay.
Thank you.
I'm wondering on the aid announced today, when do seafood processors expect to receive thefunding, I guess, in their accounts to get started on introducing these measures? and what criteria will they have to meet in order to qualify?



So the funding is actually going to flow through the regional agency.
We are looking at now the ways that it's able to get it out the door as quickly as possible because we know how important this is for processors to have the funds.
Today's announcement will provide stabilization for them so they know it's there, they know they can access it. Many of them have ongoing relationships with the regional development agency, so we felt this was the quickest and easiest way to access the funds.



Thank you.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
Our next question.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] good afternoon.
Dr. Njoo, when we start to reopen the economy, what will this look like in businesses andhair salons for example with regards to personal protective equipment.
Will everyone have to wear gloves, face masks? what will P.P.E. Look like during this reopening of the economy?



Thank you for the question.
Dr. Tam and I are having fruitful discussions with our provincial and territorial counterparts.
We are talking about guidelines and criteria that would allow us to loosen public health measures.
For example, one such principle could be in one region, in one community, has community transmission been stemmed? we need the capacity to screen our population.
The health care system must also be healthy.
and well equipped to follow up contact and to manage people in hospitals.
There is a whole range of criteria.
Show us that cases have been well controlled.
We have a lot of awareness.
We may be able to loosen certain public health guidelines for outdoor activities for example, gradually, based on where each province with regard to the epidemic curve, these provinces could allow people to, for example, go outside, to go for an ice walk in the park for example while social distancing of course.
We are currently discussing the matter.
We can't give you any details as of yet as this is an ongoing discussion we're having.
This is an evidence and data-based approach and so we may have information for you over the next few days or weeks.
This is a continuous conversation for today and tomorrow.



**Reporter**:

Minister miller?



It would be irresponsible to talk about reopening the economy.
The first wave, there means there could be a second one.
Some countries have succeeded well with regard to the first wave.
They reopened slightly too quickly.
That's the risk.
We'll have to examine data and evidence.
We'll have to base ourselves diligently on science.
We'll have to study the epidemiological curves in various provinces, various territories and indigenous communities.
Different strategies could be done on a tailored approach.
Speculating on deconfining our country would be irresponsible because this has to be a constant evaluation.
It must be based on mass screening, which has not been done at the moment.
Blood tests also have to be done in the next few months.
All this information will then feed into our dialogue on deconfining the country.
and this so long as we haven't deployed a vaccine.



**Reporter**:

Second question.
I'll try to ask a more simple question.
My question had to do with P.P.E. and you said nothing on the matter.
is there enough stock to protecteveryone or will there be when we start to reopen the economy? you keep saying we're not ready, we don't have enough, but provinces are ready to reopen.
Do we have enough stock to protect people? could you talk to us about it infrench.
is it abstract? we don't have data on it yet.



Answer.
Dr. Njoo.
When it comes to P.P.E. We've already highlighted the fact there is a difference between medical grade masks and others.
N95s are essential for health care workers and essential workers on trains for example.
When it comes to the general population, perhaps it could be a good idea for people who are slightly symptomatic if they are unable to keep a two-metre social distance.
For example, in public transit or the grocery store.
Perhaps they could wear a nonmedical grade mask, so I believe and I've seen it myself online, there is a whole range of nonmedical masks to buy with instructions and even on our ownwebsite, we have instructions tobuild your own homemade masks.
Made out of various materials.
You have to make sure that waterdroplets cannot go through thesemasks.
We must also highlight the fact that if we have a nonmedical grade mask, it's not to protect ourselves from others, it's another way for us to protect others from ourselves.
If, for example, we are slightlysymptomatic, if you're coughing for example, it's to protect others from you.



Thank you, doctor.
That's all the questions we have for today.



**Rosemary**:

That is the federal briefing from both cabinet ministers and public health officials today.
The focus a little bit on the announce that the prime minister made earlier about support for fish and seafood processing.
Also questions about whether more would be forth coming for fish harvesters.
and the answer was basically, yes, indeed, that is the case.
But the vast majority of the questions really about how we move forward and that is really where the focus of much of the country is right now, although on very different timetable.
I'll bring in Catherine Cullen.
She's been helping us with coverage.
Lots of questions and I'll let you talk about it, around herd community.
I thought Dr. Tam was pretty definitive in her assessment of that.



**Catherine**:

We have seen a few points of -- I'll call them contention between the federal government and what is happening in quÉbec.
This in terms of the advice from medical experts is certainly going to be one of them.
We heard Francois legault and the chief public health officer this in that province talking about the concept of herd immunity when it comes to young children.
That as quÉbec looks at gradually bringing children back to school -- the idea is not to do it all at once -- they would hope officials have said to build up herd immunity so the population could eventually be broadly immune to COVID-19. We heard Theresa Tam saying there, they don't support that idea.
The science is not there yet.
This feeds into the question we've been talking about, the issue of immunity passports.
Something that Chile is looking at. a lot of people might think, if you've had COVID-19 you're immune.
We're hearing from the world health organization and Dr. Tam today, the science is not there yet.
They do not know what happens in terms of a number of issues.
Yes, you develop antibodies when you have COVID-19, but when do they peak? what happens when you get the disease again? we heard Dr. Tam talking about Host of issues having to do with what happens if the virus mutates.
But she said quickly when it comes to the concept of herd immunity, it's not something that should be undertaken.
That is going to provoke interesting questions.
We'll be interested to see how officials in that province respond.
I think it's also important to mention one of the things that officials mentioned up top, the question of vaccination broadly.
There is interesting things to reflect on in terms of the vaccine for COVID-19. and the number of questions around when will one be developed, the challenges with the disease.
She was blunt with the fact it'snot something they understand well.
These are the early stages.
She sees signs of hope when it comes to the number -- essentially the size of the effort here, the number of studies undertaken, the amount of research done in order to find a vaccine, but officials making the point today there are, of course, other diseases out there.
and because people are staying home, they don't want them to stop getting their children immunized.
It's a must-do. You must continue to vaccinate your children.



**Rosemary**:

In the United States they warned against the double hit of a second wave of the COVID-19 and the regular flu, so the idea that you need to be vaccinated against the seasonal flu as well.
Catherine, thank you very much for the great coverage today.
Catherine Cullen.
We will leave it here on CBC news network.
Just a reminder that the Prime Minister and officials are going to take a break from daily briefings tomorrow.
I happen to have it on fairly good authority they'll be back on Monday and so will I. Our coverage continues with Michael serapio.



**Michael**:

Thank you for that.
Let's say that we're going to get back to the COVID-19 coverage a little later in the programme, but right now let's turn our attentions to Nova Scotia because police in the province continue to investigate right now last weekend's deadly mass shooting.
We certainly have learned a lot since then about the 22
