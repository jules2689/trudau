# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We need to defeat this virus, not just within our borders, but wherever it will be found.
That's how we'll beat COVID-19 for good.
So just like we're coordinating our efforts across the country, we're collaborating with allies around the globe too.
Earlier this morning I joined leaders from other countries and from civil society and industry to work together on accelerating the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and testing.
We all share a common goal ending this pandemic, and Canada's stepping up to do its part.
Canada's contribution of over $850 million for the global fight against COVID-19 includes investments in Canadian and international research.
At home, we're providing funding for everything from the university of Saskatchewan's vaccine and infectious disease organization for their work on vaccine development to vancouver-based abselera for treatments.
Right across the country we're making sure that Canadians can keep leading.
Our $850 million commitment alsoincludes support for vaccine development through the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and theW.H.O.'s solidarity trial that helps hospitals share information on treatments.
The more we cooperate, the more likely that we find a cure and find it quickly.
and that's something we all want to see.
[ voice of interpreter ]from the beginning of this crisis, we have been focused on what's been happening here.
We're working hard to ensure thesafety of all Canadians, supportour front-line workers, and prepare the recovery of our economy.
But COVID-19 is a global challenge that requires a globalsolution, and everyone must do their part.
Canada's contribution to the global fight against COVID-19, which amounts to more than $850 million, includes investments in research carried out in both Canada and around the world.
It also includes the development of a vaccine through the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and theW.H.O.'s solidarity trial.
By working all together on theseissues, we are maximizing our opportunities to find a solutionmore quickly.
and that's what all countries and all citizens of the world would like to see.
[ end of interpretation ]. COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge, but it's not the first time that Canadians have been called to do their part.
Over the past generations, Canadians have time and time again stepped up in defence of our shared future.
This week marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation ofthe netherlands and a victory ineurope day.
From the fall of 1944 to the spring of '45, thousands of Canadians pushed back the occupying forces, road by road, town by town.
They fought, and many died, to defend the values that we hold dear: peace and democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.
and today, 75 years later, we remember their courage and theirsacrifice.
Earlier this morning I spoke with mark ripta, the Prime Minister of the netherlands.
We talked about the close lasting bonds of friendship thatexist between our two countries.
We talked about how we collaborated together in years past, standing for our values, fighting side by side, and how we are doing that again today inthis global crisis, in friendship and in solidarity.
So today I ask all Canadians to join me and our friends and allies in the netherlands, at 2 PM eastern time, to observe two minutes of silence in honourof our veterans.
As we pause, let's reflect on how each of us can live up to their example.
Maybe you'll do your part by staying home to protect our health care workers.
Maybe you'll bring groceries to an elderly neighbour or make a donation to a food bank, or simply make the effort of sending a postcard to a veteran to thank them for their service.
With your actions, you're contributing to your community and demonstrating that Canadians, time and time again, will continue to step up. I know the weather's getting nicer, but we still need to be extremely careful, and not just for our seniors, but for everyone around us. So don't go out unless you absolutely have to, and if you do, keep 2 metres apart from each other.

Perhaps you're going to do your share by staying home to protectour health care workers, or making a donation to a food bank, or writing a postcard to aveteran to thank them.
Each of us can help our community, but whatever you decide to do, do continue to stay home and keep a distance of2 metres between you and others.
Thank you.
