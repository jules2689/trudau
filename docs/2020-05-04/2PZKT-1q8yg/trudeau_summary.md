### Summary:


Earlier this morning I joined leaders from other countries and from civil society and industry to work together on accelerating the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and testing.
Canada's contribution of over $850 million for the global fight against COVID-19 includes investments in Canadian and international research.
At home, we're providing funding for everything from the university of Saskatchewan's vaccine and infectious disease organization for their work on vaccine development to vancouver-based abselera for treatments.
Right across the country we're making sure that Canadians can keep leading.
Our $850 million commitment alsoincludes support for vaccine development through the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and theW.H.O.'s solidarity trial that helps hospitals share information on treatments.
We're working hard to ensure thesafety of all Canadians, supportour front-line workers, and prepare the recovery of our economy.
Canada's contribution to the global fight against COVID-19, which amounts to more than $850 million, includes investments in research carried out in both Canada and around the world. COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge, but it's not the first time that Canadians have been called to do their part.
Over the past generations, Canadians have time and time again stepped up in defence of our shared future.
From the fall of 1944 to the spring of '45, thousands of Canadians pushed back the occupying forces, road by road, town by town.
We talked about how we collaborated together in years past, standing for our values, fighting side by side, and how we are doing that again today inthis global crisis, in friendship and in solidarity.
So today I ask all Canadians to join me and our friends and allies in the netherlands, at 2 PM eastern time, to observe two minutes of silence in honourof our veterans.
Maybe you'll do your part by staying home to protect our health care workers.
With your actions, you're contributing to your community and demonstrating that Canadians, time and time again, will continue to step up.
[ voice of interpreter ]this week marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation ofthe netherlands and the victory in europe day.
From the fall of 1944 to the spring of 1945, thousands of Canadians fought back the occupation forces, one town at atime.
At 2 PM eastern time, I AM asking all Canadians to join me to observe two minutes of silence in honour of all our veterans.
Perhaps you're going to do your share by staying home to protectour health care workers, or making a donation to a food bank, or writing a postcard to aveteran to thank them.
