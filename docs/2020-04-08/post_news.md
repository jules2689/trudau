**Rosemary**:

That is the end of the federal cabinet and federal public health officials briefing on the pandemic.
The big news is some major changes to the wage subsidy program, now allowing businesses to qualify if they've lost just 15% of their revenue in March, also allowing them to choose different months, from January and February, as a reference period.
Charities can also apply for the wage subsidy and choose whether to include the government subsidy in their overall revenues.
We will get more details on this from bill morneau at 1:30 eastern.
It still has to go through parliament and they are still negotiating the date to have some M.P.s inside the house of commons.
We will leave it on that note because quÉbec is giving an update in that province.
Here is franÇois legault and provincial officials.



**Premier François Legault**:

[voice of interpreter] -- so the employees as well as the residents.
We will be testing everyone to know properly what the situation is and to be able to follow those places where things are more difficult.
So Danielle is going to be talking to you about the residences for the elderly later.
But I still want to come back to the residences for the elderly who live at home.
It's important.
Ideally, no contact.
We ask them not to go out.
We are asking those who take food to them to keep 2 metres away from them, to not take advantage of the fact that they're there to start chatting.
You can do that over the phone after.
So it's really, really important to keep that distance.
The last thing that we want is for people over 70 years of age to catch the virus.
So let's keep that in mind.
It's true for Easter.
So I'll be the first.
I'm used to every year, it's like mother's day.
Easter I would go to My mother's. But now I won't be going to My mother's. I'll be calling her of course onsunday, but I won't be seeing her.
I want us to mobilize ourself, all of society, all of quÉbecersto do everything to protect our elderly.
That should be our priority mission in the upcoming days andweeks.
So the numbers for the day.
Unfortunately, 25 new deaths.
We are now at 175 deaths.
Of course I wish to offer My condolences to those families of the victims.
We have now 10, 031 confirmed cases, an increase of 691.
632 people are being hospitalized.
That is an increase of 49. Out of those 682, there is 181 people who are in intensive care, so an increase of only 17. I wish to tell you -- yes, I have to cough in My elbow.
I'm sorry.
Next time.
I wish to tell you that it's been a few days that we've been seeing that it's really stabilizing in terms of hospitalizations.
That really truly is good news.
That means that we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, we are continuing this way, we are starting to win that fight that we're waging, which is encouraging, and which brings us to start preparing the next steps, which is the reopening of stores and businesses.
But I just want to tell you, we're not there yet.
We still have to keep seeing these kinds of days as we've Hardin the past few days, where there's no big increases in the number of cases and number of people in intensive care.
I wish to talk to entrepreneurs, to owners, to managers of businesses to explain to you the discussions we are having with public health.
First, of course, when we re-open businesses, it will be very important to concentrate onthose businesses where people really can -- and here I make itthe responsibility of owners andmanagers to remain 2 metres away.
Employees at all times have to be 2 metres away from their colleagues and 2 metres away, ifthat is the case as well, from clients.
That is going to be an importantcriteria.
The 2 metres, get used to it in quÉbec.
That is going to last months.
Next few months we are thinking about reopening businesses, but the guidelines for businesses will remain for months.
Get used to that guideline.
Of course as well when we're thinking of reopening businessesand stores, well of course that also will have an effect on daycare.
Of course it's difficult to respect the 2 metres in schools and in daycare.
So we have to ask ourselves questions.
If we want workers to go back towork, what is going to happen with the children and with public transportation and rush hour? so we're going to be asking -- in the next few days we will askemployers to be flexible with schedules so not all workers usethe transportation and all be inthe trains and metros and buses.
It's not that simple.
I see comments saying all businesses that are 2 metres away should all be reopened tomorrow morning.
Yeah, okay, what are you going to do with the kids and the employees who need to use publictransport? we have to take precautions.
Yes, I'm optimistic we'll be able to in the next few days andweeks to start opening businesses and stores.
We have to be prudent and make acall out to the responsibility and accountability of employers.
The numbers have to continue stabilizing.
For those numbers to continue stabilizing, we have to work hard.
I know we're asking a lot of quÉbecers, but it is important to remain disciplined.
I wish to now get back to the scenarios that were presented yesterday by the experts of public health.
For me, there's two data that isvery reassuring.
First of all, the projections onthe number of hospitalizations and the number of people who would be in intensive care depending on the different scenarios.
You saw that in intensive care in the most pessimistic of scenarios, which is that of an italian style or a little bit what happened in spain, we wouldneed 1, 000 beds with ventilators in intensive care.
That, if it's necessary, we haveit.
We don't believe it will be necessary, but we have that capacity of having a thousand beds with ventilators.
If the pessimistic scenario werethe one to take place.
So that is very good news that we got yesterday during the presentation.
The second good news that we gotin the data that was presented yesterday is to see that up until now our scenario, that of quÉbec, is a lot closer to that of the best countries, such as germanys, as opposed to the countries where there were more deaths.
and that we -- this is due to quÉbecers respecting guidelines.
So I think we can be proud of the results that we've had up until now, while saying, let's not stop.
We started really well.
We are heading the right way.
The daily thanks.
I wish to give those thanks to all those working in the residences for the elderly, whether it be doctors, nurses, attendants.
I know the situation is hard, and I just want to show you first courage.
Reinforcements are coming.
I also wish to say thank you so much for your devotion in circumstances that are difficultin chlds and residences for the elderly.
So a very special thank you today to all those who work in those residences.
and I would like to end by perhaps concentrating on the 2-metre guideline because each quÉbecer is going to have to visualize themselves in the nextfew weeks and months of keeping away from people.
This is a new culture.
We can't shake hands and be too close to other people.
Let's try all together to start visualizing this.
You know for a certain number ofmonths this is how it's going to be. We're going to be staying 2 metres away from other people.
I would like to conclude by saying the last few days' data make me optimistic.
We are starting to see the lightat the end of the tunnel and we're starting to win that fighttogether.
I'm proud of the work that has been done by quÉbecers who have been unified since the beginning.
We need to keep working --



**Andrew**:

We are going to leavequÉbec city and take you to Toronto, where the premier of Ontario, Doug ford, is speaking.
Let's listen.



**Premier Doug Ford**:

Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones to this terrible virus.
With those who are suffering with COVID-19 right now.
The reality is, this virus has taken a massive toll on all of us. The huge strain on families, seniors, who can't have their loved ones visit them right now.
The economic fallout, countless people losing their jobs, struggling right now.
I know how hard it is for everyone isolating at home, but this period has been hardest for our essential workers.
They're getting up every day.
They're leaving their families and children behind and getting to work.
I know that's not easy.
I know it's causing anxiety for them and their loved ones, but want you to know that Ontario recognizes your sacrifice.
I want you to know -- I want our dedicated men and women on the front lines to know that Ontario has your back.
You have an army of 14.5 million people behind you, from every person isolating at home, to the incredible companies stepping up, retooling to get supplies to the frontlines.
Yesterday we put out another call to action.
We called Ontario for more boot son the ground, reinforcements for our healthcare workers.
We launched a system to connect people with healthcare skills, to healthcare jobs that desperately need to be filled, and the response has been absolutely incredible.
As of today, we've seen nearly 8, 000 individuals sign up. There are already 1, 000 people matched to potential jobs.
We're going to deploy those workers as soon as possible filling vacancies in the healthcare system all across Ontario.
and now we're making sure we have the necessary infrastructure, we have the beds we need.
That's why today we're accelerating critical construction projects in our healthcare sector.
We're extending the hours of construction to help get these projects built faster, to help get hospitals built faster, to get more beds and capacity builtin the system.
That includes assessment centre sand temporary structures needed to prepare for any surge in COVID-19 cases.
We have to be ready for any scenario and the health and safety of our workers is top of mind in this pandemic.
That's why we're introducing new measures today to seep essential workers across Ontario safe and healthy.
Whether you work in a grocery store or on a construction site, we're looking out for you.
We're redeploying inspectors to ramp up investigations.
We're issuing a call to all inspectors to join the fight against COVID-19 and help keep employees safe and healthy during these uncertain times.
I'll let Minister McNaughton speak more to these important measures in a moment.
With a long week ahead of us, I have an important message for essential workers.
We've been listening to business owners and essential employees.
The truth is that everyone working in our grocery stores and pharmacies, our truck drivers, and those working the line, they've been working day and night for weeks to keep the food and medicine we need on theshelves.
In one way we're saying thank you and making sure they have this Friday and Sunday off.
They deserve a break and some quality time with their families.
Stores will be open Thursday, Saturday, and of course Monday onwards.
Let's give our workers a break they've earned.
Today we're also saying thank you to our truck drivers.
Truckers can pick up a free coffee on us on any en route location.
Thank you to all our heroes out there, our healthcare workers, essential workers, all the caregivers and truck drivers, you're incredible.
We owe you everything.
Thank you and god bless the people of Ontario.



Well, thank you.
The health and safety of worker sis always a top priority of thisgovernment.
Never has there been a time whenthat's been more important.
There's a lot of hardship out there and a lot of fear, but I also see a lot of gratitude.
Gratitude for the people who are going about their jobs so that all of us can get through this, the call centre workers, the grocery store clerks, the pharmacists, the builders and trades people, and of course thetruckers.
I could list hundreds more.
These workers are performing vital services.
They're helping us get by in trying times.
Families across Ontario bang their pots and pans for them every night at 7:30. My family has put a blue rib Bonn on a tree outside our outside.
They're the unsung heroes.
If you're one of those heroes, want you to know this, our government is doing everything in its power to keep you safe during this pandemic.
That means more inspectors, moreinspections, more phone lines, and more people to take calls.
No stone is being left unturned.
That's why I want to add another job to the unsung heroes, the workplace inspectors.
These men and women performed nearly 5, 000 inspections last month and doing more now.
I talked to Kevin peter and a couple other inspectors recently.
They told me they were honoured to be playing their role in these trying times.
This is truly public service.
Our inspectors are going into places to investigate problems, places where workers think they're in danger.
They're sorting those problems out, working with employers and employees and encouraging parties to work together.
Where warranted, they're shutting workplaces down.
They're the ones following up on complaints to our phone line.
That phone line is 877-202-0008, where any worker in Ontario can call to express their concerns.
Today I'm announcing a number of advances in our mission to keep workers safe on the job.
First, we've extended invitations to recently retired inspectors to come back on the job.
Second, we're redeploying more than 30 employment standards officers to help businesses understand and comply with health and safety requirements.
Third, we're deploying another 30 specialists from various health and safety associations to support employers and workers in the field.
Fourth, we're issuing more health and safety guidance notes to support specific sectors.
Finally, we're doubling the capacity of Ontario's health and safety call centre to 50 lines from its current capacity of 25. The total result of the five action items I've announced today will be more inspections, more capacity for workers to voice concerns, and more capacity to follow up on those reports.
If you're a worker in Ontario, want to tell you I appreciate your service and so do the millions of people who you're helping.
If you ever feel unsafe call 877-202-0008, that's if you feel unsafe doing your job.
We believe in leaving no stone upturned when it comes to keeping workers healthy and safe across the province.
Thank you.



**Premier Doug Ford**:

Thank you, Minister.
Before we start the questions, want to address a couple of things that have been on My mind for the last little while.
There's two things that I'm zoned in on. One, the P.P.E. Items, that again we're working day and night and I do see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, but we need to continue to work hard.
Number two that I haven't been involved in and I have been transparent right from the beginning.
I rely on our health experts to give myself, My deputy premier, Minister of health, christine elliott advice.
We have a great, great deal of respect for the health professionals.
We have some of the best health minds anywhere in the world sitting at our COVID-19 command table.
What is concerning me and I havebeen on the phone last night with the c. O. of Ontario health manny anderson.
What is unacceptable, absolutelyunacceptable, is the numbers of testing that we're doing.
I may not understand health, butwhat people understand around this province and what I understand are numbers.
We also understand countries that have tested and ramped up testing have shown results.
As I mentioned to our command table and to the c. O. last night, now My patience has run thin and no more excuses.
It's unacceptable.
We have the capacity now.
Before, I understand, we didn't have the reagent and all the supplies.
We have the testing centres and capabilities.
We have the reagent.
We say we can do 13, 000 a day, then we need to start doing 13, 000 every single day.
I want to see every single long-term care facility tested, every patient, all the workers at the long-term care, along with seniors' residences.
I want to see every frontline healthcare worker in this province tested, along with the first responders, our police, our fire, our paramedics.
We owe it to them, along with other people being tested.
The days are done of these 2, 000and 3, 000 a day being tested.
Moving forward, moving forward we need to see 13, 000 tests every single day.
I have the confidence of our health team.
I have the confidence of our leadership at the table.
We have to make this happen.
We need to start doing it immediately, starting tomorrow.
Thank you.



Okay.
We'll go to the phone line for questions.
First question.



**Operator**:

First question comes from Collin DE mellow from CTV news.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hello, premier.
a lot of the questions you'll probably get about testing.
I want to kick off by asking you, do you feel as though rightnow, the command table, yourself, your health Minister, do you guys have an accurate view of just how far COVID-19 has actually spread across Ontario?



**Answer**:

Well, I go back, Collin -- first of all, I want to tell you something, I have the best deputy premier and Minister of health that I could ask for.
Christine has been working her back off all day and night and I'm grateful for her leadership and partnership with myself and the rest of our team.
To get it's a full scale, it's common sense.
The more people you test, the better the numbers are going to be. Again, it's unacceptable.
There's no more excuses why we're testing 3, 000 a day or a little over 3, 000.
We need to see 13, 000 people tested every single day moving forward.
Collin, it hurts me coming out here every day and seeing the incredible job My deputy premier and Minister of health is doing and constantly under fire.
Well, those days are done.
We're going to move forward in rapid fashion to make sure every single person possible can get tested.
We need to start making sure we test the front line healthcare workers, access the -- test the mas a priority.
That's the least we can do. The sacrifice these front line men and women are doing for our province and our country, we need to support them.
I give them My word, the support is coming.

---

**Question**:

Premier, we've known about COVID-19 since the middle of January in this province when we first had the first case.
Testing has slowly ramp ed up since then.
Why has it taken roughly three months to come to your attention? I mean, you've been taking the bull by the horns approach, but why is it taking so long for this to come to your attention personally?



**Answer**:

Again, I rely on our healthcare team.
Make no mistake about it. We have an incredible healthcareteam.
We have the brightest doctors in the world and I'll stand by that day in and day out.
If it wasn't enough assessment centres and then we didn't have enough testing, and then we needed more reagent.
They're done now.
We have that.
We need to move on this and immediately.
As I've always said, Collin, I've been very clear with the public.
I've stayed out of the way of the healthcare professionals andi'll continue to stay out of theway, but when it comes to the testing and the numbers.
Collin, you understand numbers.
14.5 million people in this province understand numbers.
We know one thing, when you increase testing, you're going to get better results making sure we measure the people of Ontario, who has COVID-19, who doesn't, what areas we see the spikes in. So we're going to get a move on it. Thank you, Collin.



Next question.



**Operator**:

Next question comes from Robert benzine from the Toronto star."

---

**Question**:

To your point if we have 3, 000 tests a day and we want to see 13, 000 starting tomorrow, an increase of 10, 000.
What's going to happen if these tests aren't done? is there going to be some sort of retribution on the healthcare workers or the government? what's the retribution?



**Answer**:

Robert, I don't believe in threatening.
We're asking for their help.
I want.
The people want.
It's up to them to execute it. They will.
They'll get the job done.
Again, it's unacceptable.
I'm first to admit it. We're relying on our health expertise and experts around that table, they understand health better than any of us. I just want them to make sure that we increase the testing.
I've made myself loud and clear to the table.
I've made myself loud and clear to the c. O. of Ontario health.
We're going to get it done.
I'm going to be on this like a dog on a bone right now because we have to. We have to for the sake of our front line healthcare workers, to give them ease of mind that they've been tested.
and after being tested you can go out and still two days later and get COVID-19. It's better to be tested than not and we need to test everyonepossible.
After our front line healthcare workers and first responders, we need to start testing everyone.
Simultaneously as we're testing the front line healthcare workers, we need to test people.
We have the testing sites ready and the testing capabilities right now and we have the reagent.
So there's no more excuses.
We need to get it done bottom line.

---

**Question**:

On a related subject, I know you said that the other thing that's been concerning you is the personal protective equipment case.
The Prime Minister says that 500, 000 of those 3m masks are arriving in Canada.
is Ontario going to get 40%, its share by population of those masks?



**Answer**:

I hope so. My last call was 11:30 with the deputy Prime Minister last night.
The deputy Prime Minister is doing an incredible job and so is the Prime Minister.
We need 40%. we're 40% of the population.
That's what we need.
We're there to support and work collaboratively with the federalgovernment.
But we can't just rely on the federal government.
We're out there sourcing all around the world.
We have a lot of hooks in the water right now all over the place.
We're confident.
I'm a lot more confident now and today than I was a couple of days ago.
Again, we're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, but that doesn't mean we can sit back on our laurels.
We have a team out there making sure we contact as many people as possible.
There are thousands of people offering.
You have to decipher.
Some are real.
Some are not real too.
We have to make sure when this equipment comes in, the n95 maskss, they get tested and properly tested, we send them over to get tested and by healthcanada and s. G.s. To make sure they're certified n95 masks.
There's a lot of fraud going on around the world and we have to make sure when we purchase this personal protective equipment it's real.
I have another great story about the gowns, the surgical gowns.
So there's a few companies out there that are ramping up to do the surgical gowns.
So everything is ramping up and coming together now on the P.P.E. Side of things.
But the P.P.E. is one thing, butbeing tested is another.
We have to focus on making sure, as we're working on P.P.E. Items, that simultaneously we'redoing testing.



Next question.



**Operator**:

Next question comes from Cynthia mulligan from city news.

---

**Question**:

Hi, premier.
Not only have we had so few tests done in this, but we're also the lowest per ca pita of any province in this country.
You've been asked about this by many times by myself and other reporters.
Where has the failing been? why has Ontario had the lowest rate in the country? what has the barrier been?



**Aarti**:

Well, what the barrier was prior was the reagent.
Again, Cynthia, I'm not going to look to the past.
We're going to look to the past mistakes and move forward.
I know moving forward that testing is going to be ramp ed up. Again, no more excuses.
It's unacceptable.
I agree with you 100%. I can give you every excuse in the book why it wasn't happening, be it the testing capabilities or the assessment centres or not having enough reagent.
I'm done with that.
M done.
We have everything in place.
No more excuses.
As you can see, I'm a little frustrated.
I'm not frustrated per SE with the people because we have greatpeople.
I want to emphasize that to the public.
We have a great health team, but we have to get moving on this immediately, immediately.

---

**Question**:

But, premier, to follow up on that, every province has the same challenge of getting reagent and setting up assessment clinics.
We're the ones who have come out on the bottom there.
How is that possible?



**Answer**:

Well, I've been following the advice from our chief medical officer.
I've been taking that.
I think he's been doing a great job, but we need to increase testing.
Again, I could run through a million excuses why.
I don't believe in excuses.
Let's come up with solutions, not excuses.
What are we going to do moving forward? we're going to make sure more people are tested.
I'm confident when we come in here day after day we're going to see results and make sure we see results.



Next question.



**Operator**:

Next question from Travis dun rash of global news.

---

**Question**:

Hey there, premier.
The first question is about the testing, as you would expect --



**Answer**:

I'm sorry, Travis, could you repeat the first part.

---

**Question**:

Yeah, it's on testing.
Can you hear me?



**Answer**:

Yeah.

---

**Question**:

So when you spoke to the command table, what was their reaction and did they -- you said that you want 13, 000 tests starting tomorrow, you want every single front line health worker tested and every single care worker tested, did they say, yes, premier, this is going to be feasible starting this week? tell us a little bit more about how that conversation went and what they said to you in response to your concern.



**Answer**:

Well, what I heard is, yes, we're going to get it done.
We have a relatively new c. O. atontario health, which I have a great deal of respect for.
He's a very, very bright individual.
He gets frustrated at times too, like all of us. You know something, I believe in dale caregie.
He apologized and said it's not going to happen again and this is what we're going to do to correct it. He has a plan and he's going to get the testing done.
I respect that.
Someone realizes it hasn't gone down the right road and we're going to make it happen.
We could sit here when we talk about government and the size ofontario and give you every reason.
I don't believe in that.
Let's get this moving, move forward, learn by our mistakes, and make sure it doesn't happen.
I have all the confidence in the world in matt Anderson over at Ontario health, he's going to get it done.

---

**Question**:

I have a question for you on cottage country, but just to follow up on that.
Are you saying you're confident 13, 000 tests will start as of tomorrow?



**Answer**:

Well, I'm not going to quantify exactly the numbers.
But what I am saying is 3, 000 tests, or a little over 3, 000 tests, is unacceptable.
We have the capabilities for 13, 000 tests a day, and there's reason why we shouldn't be getting 13, 000 a day.
That's our goal.
I'm going to be following up with the team later today and make sure the plan is clear.
Start testing the front line folks at long-term care, test the residents, test the seniors in seniors' homes, and make surewe test all frontline healthcareworkers.
and along with making sure we test our police officers, our firefighters, our paramedics, it's critical we take care of these people.
Simultaneously we have to continue testing the public as well.
It's all hands on deck right now.
Test, test, test, test, test anddon't stop testing.
Let's see over the next few days.
I'll be here every day moving forward and let's take a look atthe numbers.
I'm confident that we're going to go in the right direction.
On your second comment about cottage country, I had a messagefrom norm miller, a representative up in the muskokaarea, specifically huntsville and bracebridge, along with many, many mayors and wardens I've talked to, they're begging us to get the message out over this long weekend, don't go to your cottage.
We can't stress it enough.
There's no one who loves the cottage more than I do, but I'm not going to My cottage.
We need to listen to the protocol that the chief medical officer has requested.
and especially the people up there.
You know how nice the people areand so salt of the earth up in cottage country, but they have to take care of their families in crisis.
They don't have as many acute care beds as we do here in largeurban centres.
When 50, 000 or 100, 000 people start heading north, you clean the shelves off in the grocery stores.
We all know the lineups are longenough right now.
We don't want to put that burdenon people up in the cottage country.
Please stay home.

Next question comes from Alison Jones of the Canadian press.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Hi, premier.
On testing.
First you said the issue was there wasn't enough assessment centres, then we need to ramp up lab capacity, then there wasn't enough reagent.
What's your understanding based on the discussions you've had with people in the health system about what the issue still was because those problems have been solved is My understanding for Little while now.
What is your understanding of why we were still having this issue over a large testing gap?



**Answer**:

Just over the last four or five days we were able to restock the reagent.
I could give you a list, Alison, what I hear all day long from myteam.
But we have to move forward.
We have to move forward and learn from our mistakes in the past.
Again, I rely and I will continue to rely on our experts around the health table.
I understand -- and you, Alison, understand -- and every ontarianunderstands the numbers.
People understand that south Korea flattened --



**Andrew**:

and we are taking you live now to Toronto.
The ministers of finance, small business, and industry are speaking now.
They are providing more information about the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
Let's listen.



That people have money for the essentials.
 [voice of interpreter] top priority has been people.
We are protecting people's health and ensuring they have access to the care they need.
In spite of this unprecedented disturbance in our economy, we want to make sure people have enough money to buy essential goods.
[end of translation] many people have made sacrifices to stay home and also the businesses who have temporarily shut down to protect us from the spread of COVID-19. I know it's not been easy, but nothing's more valuable than ourhealth.
As we've said from the very beginning, we will use all tools that we have to help Canadians get through this.
We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit.
I think you may have heard that applications opened on Monday and millions of Canadians have now applied.
We announced the Canada emergency business account, which will provide small business eds and non-profits withinterest-free loans of up to $40, 000.
and 25% of this loan will be forgivable up to $10, 000 if it'spaid back by december 31, 2022.
Today we are announcing applications for this loan will begin starting tomorrow.
Loans will be available through large and small banks as well asthrough credit unions as the program unfolds.
Please reach out to your financial institution over the phone or online for the application process.

Contact your financial institution by phone or online for more details on the application process.
[end of translation] last week we announced the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which will provide a 75% wage subsidy to employers that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. It will be retroactive to March 15 and provide up to $847 per week per employee.
Throughout this I've been in constant communication with businesses across Canada.
 [voice of interpreter] last week we announced the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which will providea wage subsidy of up to 75% to employers who have been significantly affected by COVID-19. It will be retroactive to March 15 and will provide up to $847 per week per employee.
I have been in constant communication with businesses right across Canada.
Our government understands we need to protect our economy, andthus we have to take measures toprotect canadian jobs.
[end of translation] this would apply to providers in all sectors, except in the public sector, businesses big and small, charities, and non-profits that are significantly impacted by COVID-19 can apply for help to keep their employees.
The eligibility criteria that weannounced last week, that it would be available for employerswho saw a 30% decline compared to the same month last year allowed us to capture a broad swath of affected employers and give Canadians much-needed confidence that their jobs are safe.
But we also recognized that not all businesses are alike and notall jobs are alike.
New businesses and start-ups might not have a year's worth ofearnings to look back on. a high-growth company that's created good jobs in the past year might not show significant decline since last year, but itsgrowth might be significantly off track as a result of COVID-19, jeopardizing its ability to keep its workers.
a shop that might have been doing swift business until mid-March, at which Canadians reoriented their lives staying home to stop the spread of the virus, may have a difficult time.
Non-profits and charities are seeing the needs for their services go up, but donations inmany cases are going down.
Today we're announcing the proposed new details in order toaddress the realities, these realities, of different businesses and organizations.
Our goal is clear.
We want to make sure that employers that have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 get the help they need to support their workers throughtheir crisis.
First, given that the impacts ofthe COVID-19 crisis were still evolving through the first half of March 2020, we're proposing that for March the revenue test will be 15%. in other words, businesses will need to show that during that period their revenue went down by 15%. for April and may the revenue test will continue to be at 30%. employers will have to apply foreach month and attest to the drop each month.
We're also proposing two possible benchmarks for employers.
They'll be able to compare revenues to their revenues last year or, alternatively, they canuse an average of revenues in January and February of this year and compare March, April, and may revenues to that same average.
Employers would calculate revenues through one of two accounting methods, either the accrual method or the cash method.
 [voice of interpreter] today we are announcing new details about thewage subsidy so it will meet therealities of different types of businesses.
First of all, since the economicimpacts of the COVID-19 crisis evolved during the first half ofmarch 2020, we are proposing that the revenue test be 15% forthat month.
For April and may the revenue test will still be a 30% decline.
We are also proposing two benchmarks for employers.
They can compare their revenue with the same month last year orthey can use an average of revenues for January and February of this year and compare them with March, April, and may.
Employers will be able to calculate their revenue based ontwo accounting methods, either the accrual method or the cash method.
[end of translation] by offeringthese different methods of calculating revenues, more employers and employees will getthe help that they need.
We know that times are tough, but we're encouraging employers to do all that they can to top-up their employees' pay to 100% of pre-crisis pay levels.
We're all doing our part to helpyou through this challenge.
In order to make it simpler and cost-effective for employers to rehire workers, the government is proposing to refund employer contributions to employment insurance, the Canada pension plan, the quÉbec parental insurance plan, and the quÉbec pension plan as well.
We're also proposing flexibilityfor non-profits and charities because we recognize that those organizations are each facing their own funding pressures at this time.
So we're proposing that when charities and non-profits are calculating their revenue tests, they be allowed to choose whether or not to include government funding in that test.
 [voice of interpreter] and in order to make the rehiring of employees easier for employers, the government is proposing to refund employer contributions to the c. P.p., the parental plan inquÉbec, the q. P.p., and e. I. we are proposing to be flexible with non-profit organizations and charities.
When we see that you are facing funding challenges now.
That's why we are proposing thatwhen charities and non-profits calculate their revenue to determine whether they're eligible or not to the program, they choose whether or not to include government funding.
[end of translation] we know youare honest people who look afterpeople and play by the rules, however, we're making sure that anybody who tries to skirt the rules faces significant consequences.
To begin with, applicants will have to designate someone with control over their finances to make sure that their claims are appropriate.
Any business that receives the benefit and is discovered to be ineligible will have to repay the full amount.
Anyone caught abusing the program could face penalties up to 225% of what they received and up to five years in prison.
This is a high-trust program, but we will not tolerate abuses.
 [voice of interpreter] we want to ensure that people who tried to skirt the rules understand that they will be punished.
We are talking about penalties up to 225% of the finish received and up to five years inprison.
[end of translation] we want to make sure we do not let down theworkers who are trusting us to support them.
As we navigate these uncertain times, government will continue to listen to the needs of Canadians.
In the historic face of a historic health crisis, we are providing historic support.
Now is the time for everyone to come together and to work together.
Businesses who are rehiring their workers, but also parliamentarians.
Canadians are counting on us during these times.
We cannot let them down.
Our government will continue to do whatever it takes to support the workers and the businesses that make our economy strong.
We'll do this because we know that when this crisis passes -- and it will pass -- that Canada's economy will bounce back quickly and we'll be able to keep building an even better Canada.
Thank you very much.
Now I'll pass it to My colleaguemary ng, Minister of small businesses and international trade.



Thank you so much, Minister morneau, bill.
and thank you everyone for joining us today.
I've spent the last week since our original wage subsidy announcement talking to businesses of all sizes, large and small.
I've been in calls, video conferences, live q and as to reach thousands of businesses and associations to answer their questions and address their concerns and I will continue to do that each and every day as we go through this together.
That's My commitment to you.
What I've learned from these interactions is to help improve the improvements we have made to the wage subsidy.
Your concerns and feedback have had a direct line to me and our government.
When we say we're in this together, we mean it. The changes we have outlined today will mean more flexibility and support for new businesses, high-growth companies, start-upsand not-for-profit.
I want to be clear on this.
We're moving in real time.
Our job is to support you as fast as we possibly can, but ourjob isn't done until those supports are meeting your needs.
I'm paying particular attention to Canada's small businesses in this country, the backbone of our economy, and the very heart of our communities, from the corner store to the local restaurant or the tech startup or the manufacturing company andso many more.
We know that things are extremely tough for you and youremployees.
We want you to know that every aspect of this wage subsidy has been designed to preserve jobs, to keep businesses afloat, and help you prime for recovery.
Part of this effort is to help you keep your team in place, because we agree you can gain more ground more quickly and be more successful if you have preserved your team through thisordeal, readying you for the time of recovery when that time comes.
The wage subsidy is in place to directly assist you with this challenge.
Let me end with an earnest earn challenge to canadian business owners.
Thank you.
We know this is hard.
We really have your back.
Keep pushing us. Keep telling us what works and what doesn't work.
We're in a brand new world.
It's difficult and I know it's complex.
I hear from you and I hear that it's frustrating.
But if we keep talking and working together to find the solutions, we're going to weather this storm and we will come out of this the other side together.
Over to My colleague, Minister navdeep Bains.
Thank you.



Thank you very much, ministering and Minister morneau.
I too want to echo My thanks to the business community and to industry.
In particular I want to thank them for stepping up in a big way, once again, for our mobilization efforts first and foremost and really helping us make the essential equipment that we need, the personal protective equipment that we need for our front line healthcare workers and to protect them in the fight against COVID-19. I also want to echo the comments that My colleagues made with respect to businesses.
We hear you.
We're listening.
We have our ears to the ground.
We're gag ed on this file, we're seized with this issue, and we're making changes to assist and help you.
Today this underscores a commitment to high-growth firms as well.
This comes from 2015 when we advanced our skills plan, it wasdeveloped with a purpose to helpcompanies grow and succeed, not only in Canada but internationally as well.
We will redouble our efforts as we navigate ourselves through this crisis and come out the other side and start to see the recovery.
I can tell you right now we continue to have our backs and this is important because this is about jobs, this is about Canadians.
This wage subsidy underscores and highlights the importance ofretaining jobs.
It's about steady income and confidence, confidence in the economy and confidence that we will recover.
I can tell you right now that weare in this together and we willget through this together.
Thank you very much.
[ please stand by ]



Do you have a direct spending figure in dollars for that?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Thanks, David.
What we did last week was to bring out the programme and give broad understand offing what the costs were.
Our estimate was at that time $71 billion, an enormous expenditure on behalf of Canadians.
What we've seen is with the changes we've made, we expect Otto be $73 billion and that's primarily driven by the fact we've allowed employers to bring people back and we will reimburse them on employment insurance.
That is driving some change for those employees that come back.
The decision to allow for 15% decline in revenues in March to March was really driven by the fact that we see that is really this COVID-19 hit in the middle of March, so it didn't fundamentally change our calculations.



**Reporter**:

Secondly, in oil producing provinces, if I'm a company that has seen My finances go to the floor.



For companies in Canada that experienced the significant decline, they will be eligible.
For those employers in the energy sector that are seeing big declines both as a result ofcovid-19 and the OPEC decisions, they will be eligible and it will provide significant support for those organizations like it will for organizations across the country.



Next question.



Thank you, the CBC news.



**Reporter**:

This question is more Minister morneau, air Canada announced today they'll be using money from the federal wage subsidy programme to hire back 16500 laid-off workers.
I'm wondering what your reactionto air Canada hiring back employees and is this what the wage subsidy is intended to be used for, like large corporations like air Canada?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

I was very encouraged to see air Canada's decision.
This is what we're trying to do for businesses large and small.
We're trying to make sure they retain their attachment with their employees, so air Canada bringing back those employees is critically important for their business and thousands of people.
It's in that context I want to say we need the other parties in parliament to move forward and support this.
We've had both constructive comments and support from bloc Quebecois, but from the other parties that have said we need to get money to the businesses to subsidize those employees, we need them to support us and get it done quickly so we can deliver the funds required.
It's critically important.
I can't say how urgent it is. There are tens of thousands of employees like these employees at air Canada that are counting on us so they can attached to their employer and get up to $847 per week through their employer's wage subsidy.



The next question.



**Reporter**:

mr. Morneau, I wanted to continue in that vain.
I know there are negotiations with the opposition parties thatseem to have come to a standstill because of the demands being made by the conservatives and now apparentlythe n. D.p. is also posing problems.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

[voice of interpreter] wecontinue to have discussions with the other parties.
The important thing for me, we haven't had any questions about our wage subsidy, for example, we proposed that there be greater accountability with a virtual parliament.
That is very important.
So in My opinion, it's urgent.
It's urgent to reach an agreement.
It is urgent to implement this policy for people right across Canada and I do hope that the other parties will reconsider their positions so we can expedite the process.



**Reporter**:

You didn't really answer My question.
The conservative party and the n. D.p., are they posing problemsright now? are they the ones insisting -- are they the reason why the return to the house of commons has not happened yet.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

What I can say is that we have had significant discussions with all the parties.
We have received constructive discussions from the bloc in terms of their support.
and we remain in discussion with the other parties at this time.
and it is important that we reach an agreement as soon as possible.
That is important for companies and especially for people right across the country.
-- who want to benefit from that wage subsidy as quickly as possible.
That's very important.
That's why we have to continue these discussions.
But they have to come to an end.



**Announcer**:

Next question.



Thank you.
The next question is from TVA.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] inthe same vain we don't know whenthe house of commons will sit inorder to approve the subsidy.
Do you think this delay could also delay the implementation ofthe new programme.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Yes, there is always that risk and that is precisely why we need to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
In our opinion, we need to get the wage subsidy implemented as soon as possible for those businesses who are waiting for this legislation to pass.
But it's very important to consider what we're doing.
We made a decision that an employee can receive 75% of their income up to $847 a week.
That is very important for them.
and that is why we have to reach an agreement.
and if it takes more time to do that, it will be more difficult for people and, of course, more difficult for companies to access the subsidies.
So it's urgent.



**Reporter**:

Now you're saying the subsidy will come into effect in two or three weeks, so in order for that to happen, when does parliament have approve the programme?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

It's urgent.
We need there to be an agreement as soon as possible.
I can't give you an exact date, but right now, every company is reviewing its position and if there is no certainty, it's quite possible they may make a different decision and that is why we need to get this agreement in place and that way companies will make the decision to keep and protect their employees and protect the possibility of giving them $847 a week.
That is why it's urgent and that's why we need to reach an agreement with the other parties in parliament and I hope that they will reconsider their position as soon as possible.



Thank you, next question.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] good afternoon, Mr. Morneau, I'mtrying to understand if we're only going from $71 billion to $73 billion with this change, even though you're reimbursing contributions to e. I. and so on, and lowering the income level to15%, now were there companies last week that were already prepared to rehire their employers?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Well, as I said last week, we announced the programmeand the approach taken led us to believe the cost would be $71 billion, but with the improvements to the programme based on the advice of companies and associations in the last week, to make it easier for companies, for example, companies with a high growth or non-profits or charities, now we can be more precise with costs.
$73 billion is the cost and it'sa very important programme in order to protect people.
and the $73 billion will be going to people, to employees across the country.
and that's why it's urgent.
I know that people have a high level of anxiety at this time because of their circumstances and we need to get the subsidy in as soon as possible to help them.
[end of translation]



**Reporter**:

Did you not have any takers for the first version, enough companies interested and that's why you changed the criteria.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Not at all, what we'vedone is made sure the criteria are such that for those companies that said it wouldn't fit them, we made sure it fit them.
It was already capturing any employer who was experiencing a significant reduction in revenues because of COVID-19. and this is just making sure we capture, you know, the those high-growth companies.
The non-profits that have revenue from government, or companies that experienced revenue declines in the middle of March because that's when theclosure started happening most significantly.
So we think, like with all of the programmes we're putting in place, we need to be dynamic.
We need to recognize that as this challenge is confronting Canadians, our policies also need to confront this challenge.
We're thinking how we can do that that gives people confidence to get out of this challenge.



Just to build on what Minister morneau said, the changes we identified today, really reflect high growth firms as well.
The government has been focus sing on companying scale and grow and we recognize there are companies that have demonstrated growth year over year, both in terms of revenue and their employees, that may not necessarily have been eligible under the previous criteria.
So this is more expansive.
This is designed to do more, notless.
Help more businesses not less.
We have thousands and thousands of high-growth firms across the country that will benefit from these changes.
That's the objective we wanted to communicate.
Not to say this programme was not generous, but we're making it more helpful to Canadians across the country, particularlyfocussing on high-growth firms.



Thank you, next question.



The next question, David akin, global news.



**Reporter**:

There we go. Minister, thank you very much for the question.
I want to switch topics a littlebito talk about savings.
Canada is not necessarily a great nation of savers.
I wonder if you've considered letting Canadians withdraw savings from say an rrsp, or I'mnot sure what, without getting taxed.
Say you want to take $2, 000 out of your r. S.p. Without getting taxed.
Has there been any considerationto allow Canadians to tap into savings and not be taxed on it?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Our approach is to support all Canadians.
We've now announced measures that are going to directly support Canadians of about $107 billion as well as tax deferrals that are another $85 billion or so. These are the largest single decisions that have been taken since world war ii. We're looking at all ways that we can do things that are directly putting money back intopeoples' pockets.
Some of the things we've done are in line with what you just asked, allowing seniors to not have to take as much money out in the registered retirement income fund, recognizing the decline in the stock market.
So we're going to keep thinking about how we can support people.
The measures you talked about are not things current on our agenda, but obviously, we've made enormous decisions to support people directly and we're looking forward to getting these policies out.
You've seen that now millions --I think we passed 3 million people have taken up the Canada emergency response benefit this week.
I think you're going to see firms -- you've heard that air Canada is deciding to use the wage subsidy.
You're going to see firms do that rapidly once parliament approves this.
That means we'll be supporting millions upon millions of Canadians with programmes so they can get through this challenge and have enough money for the essentials.



**Reporter**:

and that's -- thank you for that.
Maybe just to think more broadly and further down the road once we start to get into a recovery, government -- your government and lots of previous government shave often struggled with the idea that Canadians have not necessarily been savers and the low interest rate environment we've had for the last decade or so has not been great to encourage people to save.
and I wonder whether or not it would be a priority coming of this implement more policies to encourage Canadians to save, before given that spending is a driver of economic growth, it would be important for the federal government to encourage Canadians to spend.
I wonder if you have thoughts of where we're going once we start to see curves move in the right direction?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

We do need to thing about dealing with the important issues today and how we get out of this.
We are starting to think about how we build ourselves back to an economy that is seeing strength, that is going to support employment, but right now we're not at a stage we are talking about the policies to ensure that happens.
We're very much focused on how we protect people getting through this crisis and ensure that the policies we have are focused on people, but also on this time so that we can both get people out of this challenge and also allow the policies to be reduced as we get out of it in a way that will support our economic growth.
So no decisions on next steps yet, but a continuing focus on how we deal with those people that are challenged and we'll continue -- as you heard the Prime Minister say -- to deal with the gaps, the challenges that are presenting themselves so we can really ensure that anybody impacted by this has the support they need to get throughit.



**Reporter**:

Thank you very much.



Thank you.
The next question is from bloomberg.



Hello, Mr. Morneau.
I have a question regarding the Canada credit rating.
I'm wondering if you're concerned about Canada's credit rating if it's endangered given the rising debt due to the unprecedented spending.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

Thank you.
The good news from the standpoint of Canada from the government finances is we started off in a very, very strong position.
Our debt as a function of our economy is not only the lowest among g7 countries but less than half the average.
We're going to keep watching that of course.
We're going to keep ensuring that we make the decisions that allow us to get out of this.
Our view is we need to make the investments, we need to protect people, because that's go to allow us to get out of this economic challenge and allow us to start up again in way that ensures we have a strong economy.
That is the most fundamental thing that we all care about.
and also that credit agencies will care about.
The strength of the economy, our ability to carry the additional debts that we will have put on in order to support ourselves do during this time.
I'm very confident given the starting point that we have, given the cost of debt right now, and given our ability to get our economy back up and going we'll be continued to be seen as a very strong government and continue to have those strong credit ratings that enable us to raise capital when required to support Canadians.



**Reporter**:

and have you received any feedback from credit rating companies in that regard?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

No, we haven't. This is really a time where we're very focused on making the decisions that are appropriate for our economy, but really appropriate for Canadians.
and all of our time and literally all of our time has been spent on making sure that the policies like the wage subsidy, like the Canada emergency response benefit, like the loans for businesses are tailored and targeted correctly.
It's really not a time we're spending efforts in talking to international credit rating agencies.



Thank you, next question.



The next question is from Adam, the wire report.



**Reporter**:

Hi, My question is to Minister banes.
Have you been keeping an idea on how telecommunications networks are performing and what is your response?



We're in regular contact with the telecommunication companies.
I speak on a regular basis with the c. E.o. S of the companies to understand their challenges, what are the issues they may have? clearly network capacity is something that has been a challenge, but I'm proud of the fact that we have the best networks in the world and we're seeing that on full display now where people are working from home, students are doing their homework online, where people are on netflix and the networks are able to maintain those sudden spikes in network usage.
My understanding is for home internet usage, for example, week over week increases sometimes are as high as 60%, sowe've got strong robust networks, but I'm in constant contact with the telecommunications companies to understand if there is immediatechallenges or needs.
So far so good.
I want to acknowledge the field workers on the front lines that are maintaining the network.
They're essential for the fact that we're able to communicate with one another.
I want to thank those workers who are doing so much to make sure we're able to communicate with each other, our families and loved ones.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.



Thank you.
The next question, from Emily bergeron.
Qme.



**Reporter**:

[voice of interpreter] coming back to your negotiationswith the opposition parties for a return of parliament on an urgent basis as you said, you mentioned that you proposed parliament sit in virtual mode perhaps for a question period.
Was that proposal rejected by them?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

[voice of interpreter] I can't say whether it was accepted or rejected.
What I want to say is that we think it's very important to be accessible.
We believe that our approach andtransparency are very important and we also know that we need to be in parliament to consider theviews of the other parties.
That's why we considered how we might be able to do that and virtual parliament is one optionthat could work in your opinion.
So for us, the important thing is the substance of the approachwith the wage subsidy.
It will improve the situation oftens of thousands of people right across this country or even more, so it really is extremely urgent to get that policy in place and that is why I'm saying that we must reach anagreement as soon as possible.



**Reporter**:

Just to be clear, this agreement don't seem to be around if the wage, it seems to be about other things, is that correct and what are the disagreements about?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

What I can say is thatwe've had a constructive comments in support from the bloc Quebecois and we've not heard any disagreements on the substance of the wage subsidy.
I think we all realize how important it is. From that standpoint, we believeit's important to get back to work, to have this passed, so we can have the kind of support Canadians need.
We've ensured that we're accountable to other parties, so from stoint, it's time to get on with it. The next question is glen mcgregor.



**Reporter**:

Question for Minister morneau, I want to ask about the credit card relief.
Agreement with charter banks to cut rates for people who are struggling to make their payments, but what about the broader relief, why was that notconsidered? we still have high credit card interest rates and it doesn't do much to help the people relying on payday loan companies to bridge their financing from month to month.
Are there any further discussions about mandating greater cuts to lowering rates for average Canadians?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

We've been working together over the last number of weeks with the banks to make sure the banks are supporting their customers, that they're supporting Canadians.
We've, as mentioned, come to an agreement and they'll be starting to have the small business loans, 25% of which will be forgivable if small businesses pay those back before2022.
That is going to be starting tomorrow.
These are really important conclusions that can support literally hundreds of thousands, if not over a million small businesses.
We've also been pushing them to ensure they support people who are in a challenging situation.
So deferring mortgages was important.
We're seeing hundreds of thousands of mortgage deferrals and dealing with credit card fees was also important.
For people that are struggling.
That is why after the discussions we were pleased to see them cut the rates in half for people struggling.
That is critically important.
Our role as government is to support everyone.
That's what we've done through the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.
Making sure that those people who are directly impacted have support.
We'll continue to do that, work with the banks and whoever we need to work with to ensure thatcanadians get through this.



**Reporter**:

-- good news today about air Canada hiring back 16, 000 employees, but the industry as a whole in Canada isstill really struggling.
Can you tell me where we are on an aid packet specific to the airlines.



To echo the comments made by Minister morneau, it's great that air Canada has retained theemployees.
That was the intent of the wage subsidy, designed to make sure people have income, that companies can keep people on their payroll.
So when we're talking about supporting industries and supporting companies, one way todo that is to make sure we have the wage subsidy implemented andthat's why it's important that the other parties support us through this endeavour and avoid the partisan politics and allow us to implement this in a timelymanner.
But we know it's not only the airlines industry, if you look at tourism, oil and gas, the retail sector, they've been significantly challenged by the recent event, so we're going to have a holistic approach.
Our goal is to make sure we have plan in place, not only immediate needs for Canadians providing them with income, but how can we rebound and recover? more importantly, our priority is Canadians and we'll be putting forward sets of initiatives and plans and ideas to assist different industries including the airlines industry.



Thank you, next question.



The next question is James Bradshaw from "the globe and mail".



**Reporter**:

Good afternoon, Minister morneau.
My question is about the SBA small business programme.
The government considered a five-day waiting, but was considering to shorten it to twodays.
How long should business owners expect to wait for the funds?



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

I'm hopeful that the funds will be disbursed quickly.
The good news is we're in a stage where we expect that the large banks in particular will be able to start this approach literally tomorrow.
and that means that businesses will be able to go to the current institution they work with, banks, and we're also opening up to credit unions, in the days and weeks to come.
So that's important.
Then they'll be able to get the money disbursed once the bank goes through their appropriate -- processes.
Our hope is that can be within two days after that initial interaction, but it will, of course, have variability depending on the company and the financial institution they go to. The objective is to get money inpeoples' hands as soon as possible if their business is significantly challenged because of declining revenues.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
and just to follow up on that, as it expands, how broadly will you offer loans and for the business that has main account, is there somewhere they can apply?



We're working to expand it as broadly as possible to large and small financial institutions and to credit unions.
That work is ongoing.
It will be as expansive as we can get it. To the extent that someone finds challenge with the institution that they're at, of course, they'll be able to go to anotherinstitution, but the main goal is to make it broadly accessible across financial institutions so that the small businesses can get rapid access to capital in challenging time.



Thank you.
We'll be taking one last question.



Thank you.
The last question is... --



**Reporter**:

Ministers, you've said repeatedly today that these changes will benefit high-growthfirms.
Can you specify which changes --which of the three changes specifically will benefit high-growth firms because we're already hearing from some that say they still don't believe they're going to qualify based on their revenue requirements?







**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

I'll take it quickly and then pass it over to navdeep.
What we've made as an important change, initially when we came out with this, we said the test of decline in revenue was if the revenue in the March 15 to end of may period this year was 30% less than the similar period last year.
and the challenge for that is if the firm has grown significantly during the course of the last year, but experienced a decline in the last couple of months, they might still have revenue that is too high to be showing that they've been effected.
So instead, what we said, they need to look at the revenue they had in January and February of 2020.
If they can show those declines against that level of revenue, then they will be able to have access to this support.
There will always be businesses who have not been as impacted bycovid-19, that won't be eligible.
The plan was to make it so that we're capturing businesses who have had a significant revenue decline.
We think this significantly helps those high-growth companies or companies for whichthey might have been in a situation where 2019 revenues, for whatever reason, were significantly lower than 2020, but, navdeep?



I think you captured it correctly.
The fundamental goal is we recognized when we designed the programme there were certain companies that were not eligible.
The changes now capture more high growth firms and that ace key priority for us because these firms continue to give us hope in the terms of growing the economy after the crisis.
We've been focused on high-growth firms from day one.
We recognize they're essential in terms of their ability to attract talent, retain talent and create more opportunities for Canadians as well.
So as you can see from the costing today as well, the initial costing was around $71 billion for this wage subsidy programme.
After these changes, it's more generous and will help more companies, high-growth companiesand that's where the costing is $73 billion.
This is a clear signal to companies that they can engage with us and C.R.A. To see if they meet the requirements.
Of course, each company has unique set of circumstances, butwe've made the programme more expansive.

So the -- legislation and the January and February 2020 revenue comparison is limited to firms that were not carrying out business on March 1, 2019.
So those are firms less than a year.
That is not all firms.
Can you please clarify whether that January and February 2020 benchmark will apply to all firms or just firms that were not in business on March 1, 2019?



Minister morneau will speak to it.



**Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)**:

To be clear, firms have a choice.
They'll be able to compare their revenue to the revenue in January and February 2020.
So they'll have a choice.
They're not excluded based on when they started or not excluded on any other basis.
They're able to choose the place that there is more appropriate for their situation.
I'd like to thank everyone for being with us today.
We're going to continue to work on behalf of Canadians to support them through a challenging time.

You've been listening to finance Minister bill morneauas well as navdeep Bains and other ministers talking today about the emergency wage subsidy that the federal government is offering.
We also heard from the Prime Minister earlier on this where the federal government has announced that it is loosening some of the criteria around who will be eligible for this wage subsidy.
Air Canada announcing they're going to use the wage subsidy to retain 16, 000 employees.
As you know, air Canada, one of the largest firms.
This applies to large firms and small firms.
One of the larger firms hit hard by this global pandemic.
