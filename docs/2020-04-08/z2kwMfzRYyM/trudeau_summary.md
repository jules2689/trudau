### Summary:


We've brought in new measures to help families, seniors, business owners get through this.
It supports business owners, including through new loans, while helping those who no longer have a paycheque through the CERB and protecting jobs with the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
 

[voice of interpreter] since we announced the wage subsidy, we've had a great many conversations with business people, unions, and workers.
These conversations have helped us to adjust what we initially announced in order to include more businesses and help more people.
We said that businesses had to demonstrate that their revenue dropped by 30% this month compared to the last year in order to receive the subsidy.
First of all, businesses will have to show a decline of 15% intheir revenue for the month of March rather than 30% in order to consider the fact that the pandemic has had an impact on their activities in March.
Businesses will also be able to choose to use the month of January and February as the reference period to show a loss of revenue.
If your business is affected by COVID-19, the government will give you up to $847 a week for every employee. 

[end of translation] since we announced the Canada emergency wage subsidy, we've had a numberof conversations with stakeholders and workers who provided us with valuable feedback and helped us refine what we put forward.
We previously announced that to qualify for the subsidy, businesses would have to show a 30% drop in revenues when comparing the month this year to the month the previous year.
We recognize that this could be an issue for non-profits, fast-growing companies like start-ups, and new businesses.
Businesses will only need to show a 15 per cent decline in March instead of 30% because some of us only felt the impact of COVID-19 halfway through the month.
If your organization has been impacted by COVID-19, the government will give you up to $847 per week per employee. Our government understands that not all businesses operate the same way, and that's why we're making changes to include as many of you as possible.
We will keep listening, but we really hope you will use this help from your country and from your fellow citizens to rehire and pay your workers.
If our economy is to get throughthis, we need businesses to survive and workers to get paid.
 

[voice of interpreter] in recent weeks we introduced unprecedented measures including the emergencywage subsidy and the Canada emergency benefit to help workers, families, and businesses.
I'm thinking of gig workers or people who provide home care or people whose work hours are 10 hours or less a week.
We will have additional measuresput in place to help the most vulnerable Canadians.
Now, when it comes to students and young people preparing to enter the job market, we will have a number of measures to help you as well.


[end of translation] to help people in small businesses and students affected by COVID-19, we're making changes to the Canada summer jobs program.
We will also extend the time frame for job placement until the winter because we know some jobs will start later than usual.
Because many businesses have hadto scale back their operations, they will be able to hire students part time.
Our government is also encouraging all employers who have been impacted by COVID-19 to make adjustments so work can continue.
For example, if you run a local food bank, you may be doing deliveries instead of serving people on site, so you could hire students to help you.
We will also be asking M.P.s across the country to reach out to businesses and organizations providing critical services in their communities to look at howstudents can help during this critical time.
In this economic climate, it's hard for people of all ages to find work, but young people are especially vulnerable.
At the same time, they need workexperience to secure their next job and money to cover their living expenses and help with tuition for the rest of the year.
Today we're taking a step in theright direction to help young people find work during this difficult time, but I want to beclear, we will be doing more.
Just like we will be doing more for those who need help but are not eligible to receive the benefits we've announced so far.
We're also working around-the-clock to make sure our frontline workers get what they need to stay safe.
That's the best way to stay healthy and protect our frontline workers who are doing so much to help all of us.
