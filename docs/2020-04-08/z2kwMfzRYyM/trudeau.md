**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Happy international day of pink.
Today we wear pink to stand up to pink and to support those facing discrimination.
If you feel alone, are anxious or scared, know that we are herewith you today and every day.
I want to begin this morning by addressing Canada's Jewish community.
Tonight at sun down marks the beginning of Passover.
Usually this is a time for family and friends to gather around the sad er table.
Tonight will not be like other nights.
I know that staying in and not gathering with extended family will be hard, but it's the best way to keep your loved ones safe.
I know you will find a way to connect with family and friends, whether on the phone or through video chat.
To all those celebrating Passover 

[speaking foreign language]. we've all had to make adjustments.
Staying indoors and not seeing friends or family is hard, but harder for others.
If you've lost your job or are in an industry that's hit hard by this virus, you're worried about your family and your future.
What makes this situation so difficult is how quickly it happened.
Through no fault of your own, your whole world has been turned upside down in a couple of weeks.
That can create anxiety.
We've brought in new measures to help families, seniors, business owners get through this.
We've put in place a three-pointeconomic plan.
It supports business owners, including through new loans, while helping those who no longer have a paycheque through the CERB and protecting jobs with the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
I know many of you are anxious to see this subsidy delivered.
We're calling on the opposition to bring the house back to pass legislation so you can get the support you need as soon as possible.
Cabinet will be meeting this afternoon.
As usual, most cabinet members will be on the phone and I will be attending this one in person to discuss next steps.
 

[voice of interpreter] since we announced the wage subsidy, we've had a great many conversations with business people, unions, and workers.
I want to thank them for their advice and their viewpoints.
These conversations have helped us to adjust what we initially announced in order to include more businesses and help more people.
That's what I'd like to talk about today.
We said that businesses had to demonstrate that their revenue dropped by 30% this month compared to the last year in order to receive the subsidy.
We recognize that for non-profitorganizations and fast-growth companies, that could present a problem.
So we are going to relax those conditions.
First of all, businesses will have to show a decline of 15% intheir revenue for the month of March rather than 30% in order to consider the fact that the pandemic has had an impact on their activities in March.
Businesses will also be able to choose to use the month of January and February as the reference period to show a loss of revenue.
With respect to charities and non-profits, we understand that you are facing a different reality when it comes to funding.
For that reason, you will have achoice.
You can include or exclude the government subsidy when you calculate your loss of revenue.
If your business is affected by COVID-19, the government will give you up to $847 a week for every employee.
As we already announced, that subsidy will be retroactive to March 15. 

[end of translation] since we announced the Canada emergency wage subsidy, we've had a numberof conversations with stakeholders and workers who provided us with valuable feedback and helped us refine what we put forward.
I want to thank them for their input.
We want to make these emergency measures as effective and inclusive as we can, so we're listening and making adjustmentsalong the way.
We previously announced that to qualify for the subsidy, businesses would have to show a 30% drop in revenues when comparing the month this year to the month the previous year.
We recognize that this could be an issue for non-profits, fast-growing companies like start-ups, and new businesses.
So we're going to put in place more flexible rules.
Companies will now have the option of using January and February of this year as reference points to show a 30% loss.
Businesses will only need to show a 15 per cent decline in March instead of 30% because some of us only felt the impact of COVID-19 halfway through the month.
We understand charities and non-profits are experiencing different types of pressures when it comes to funding.
For this reason, they will have the possibility to include or exclude government funding when calculating loss of revenue.
If your organization has been impacted by COVID-19, the government will give you up to $847 per week per employee.
As we said before, this subsidy will be retroactive to March 15. Our government understands that not all businesses operate the same way, and that's why we're making changes to include as many of you as possible.
We will keep listening, but we really hope you will use this help from your country and from your fellow citizens to rehire and pay your workers.
If our economy is to get throughthis, we need businesses to survive and workers to get paid.
Job numbers from March will be out tomorrow.
It's going to be a hard day for the country.
We're facing a unique challenge, but I know if we pull together, our economy will come roaring back after this crisis.
 

[voice of interpreter] in recent weeks we introduced unprecedented measures including the emergencywage subsidy and the Canada emergency benefit to help workers, families, and businesses.
Having said that, some people are not eligible to the benefitswe put in place.
They need additional support.
I'm thinking of gig workers or people who provide home care or people whose work hours are 10 hours or less a week.
We are currently looking for solutions and we will help you.
Our seniors are also going through a very difficult period these days because they are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. At the same time, they're concerned about the impact of the economic decline on their savings and other consequences of the crisis.
We will have additional measuresput in place to help the most vulnerable Canadians.
Now, when it comes to students and young people preparing to enter the job market, we will have a number of measures to help you as well.
This morning we're starting withthe first step.


[end of translation] to help people in small businesses and students affected by COVID-19, we're making changes to the Canada summer jobs program.
We will give employers of that program a subsidy of up to 100% to cover the costs of hiring students.
We will also extend the time frame for job placement until the winter because we know some jobs will start later than usual.
Because many businesses have hadto scale back their operations, they will be able to hire students part time.
Our government is also encouraging all employers who have been impacted by COVID-19 to make adjustments so work can continue.
For example, if you run a local food bank, you may be doing deliveries instead of serving people on site, so you could hire students to help you.
We will also be asking M.P.s across the country to reach out to businesses and organizations providing critical services in their communities to look at howstudents can help during this critical time.
In this economic climate, it's hard for people of all ages to find work, but young people are especially vulnerable.
They're new to the workforce, sothey don't have a lot of money Seth aside for this kind of situation.
At the same time, they need workexperience to secure their next job and money to cover their living expenses and help with tuition for the rest of the year.
Today we're taking a step in theright direction to help young people find work during this difficult time, but I want to beclear, we will be doing more.
Just like we will be doing more for those who need help but are not eligible to receive the benefits we've announced so far.
We're also working around-the-clock to make sure our frontline workers get what they need to stay safe.
Overnight we received 1 million n95 masks masks from 3m and theywill be distributed across the country where they have most needed.
I know the past weeks haven't been easy, but we're going to get through this together if everyone keeps following the instructions from public health experts.
Please, stay home as much as possible.
Only go out for essential thingslike groceries and medications.
Try to make that trip once a week or less.
When you do, remember to keep 2 metres from those around you.
That's the best way to stay healthy and protect our frontline workers who are doing so much to help all of us.  

[voice of interpreter] once again, thank you for joining us this morning.
I'm now pleased to take your media questions.

Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll go to the phones for one question and a follow-up.
