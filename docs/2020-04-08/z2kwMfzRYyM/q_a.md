The first question is from headers hoffield from the"toronto star." your line is open.

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Could you talk to us about what your plan is to get people back to work safely and efficiently without provoking another outbreak?



**Answer**:

What we're seeing around the world is countries are beginning, as we see social distancing measures, as we see people staying home in countries around the world, are now looking at the steps needed to think about easing those social distancing rules, to start our economies rolling again.
It is very obvious that we need to be very, very careful that all the work we've done over these past weeks and in the coming days on staying home and following the instructions of our public health officials doesn't become for naught as spikes happen when we get back to work.
It will be important to do it Ina measured and graduated way that allows for economic opportunity to begin, while preventing severe spikes in COVID-19 transmission.
There is a lot of reflections ongoing on that.
But as we know, the current measures will be in place for many more weeks so we have time to get that right and to look at other countries that might be earlier in their phase and if Otis successful or less.

---

**Question**:

Just to follow up on that.
It seems we have some time to think about it, but there's also -- how do you assess the risk of summertime? we've been inside for four week sand people are doing it voluntarily, but what is the risk of that falling apart as the good weather comes and people are in desperate need of earnings?



**Answer**:

We will be talking about modelling in the coming days and what various scenarios are.
But what is very, very clear is that in order to avoid spiking cases and in order to avoid having to stay in reduced economic activity modes for months and months and months andmonths, we need to keep very, very strong in the measures we have now.
That is how we get to the best-case scenario.
Quite frankly, the social distancing and the staying home that Canadians are doing now is being exactly -- is exactly the right kinds of things we need inorder to look at the most optimistic models.
There is no question once we start to get to the other side of this side and are able to talk about easing off social distancing, there will be a needfor continual surveillance, continual attentiveness on testing, on contact tracing, on protecting our most vulnerable that means even as things are able to start getting back to normal, they won't be back to normal.
Calibrating that right and understanding what people are doing now is essential, what they will continue doing now is just is -- in the coming weeks is just as essential.
But how we ease off and continueto follow the best directions and instructions of our public health officials will be how we manage to get through this in the best possible way.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that it's difficult to remain in isolation or remain home during this period.
We know that we're going to have to continue to do that for many weeks to come.
But in order to have the best possible chance of coming out ofthis as quickly as possible and as healthy as possible, we must continue to comply with those recommendations that are keepingus safe.
At some point in a few months probably, when we are easing some of the measures, we will have to continue to be very vigilant about our own behaviourin returning to work to ensure that we won't be facing a new epidemic or even worse, that everything we will have done in these past weeks will have been for nothing and we'll have a major problem in the country.
So we are looking very carefullyabout how we can move on to the next phase, but there is no doubt that we are still in the midst of this phase which means you have to stay at home as muchas possible and maintain the physical distance from others.

**Question**:

Good morning.
Can you explain why the government chose not to make release payments simple, inclusive, and universal? we're hearing from a lot of people who are excluded from the measures you outlined, including those this week.
We are hearing of some people who have some income not to take the income, we are hearing from others who are told not to invoice which sounds unethical.
Why did you set things out this way?



**Answer**:

We understood we needed to do things quickly and robustly in a way that would allow your extraordinary public servants at Canada revenue agency and elsewhere to put in system that would reach the largest number of Canadians that needed it as possible.
We looked at many different designs and looked at the designs put forward, but we realized the Canada emergency response benefit was a way-giving income to those who suddenly found themselves without a paycheque and the wagesubsidy at 75% was going to be able to keep people connected totheir jobs and ensure that businesses continue to exist so that they can come back quickly afterwards.
We recognize that any time you put out large measures quickly and in a way that is solid enough to be certain that it's going to work through the machine, there are going to be gaps.
What we've talked about over these past days is ways of filling those gaps and making sure that more people who are inexceptional or different circumstances are able to accessthe help we need.
We will continue to have more to say on that in the coming days.
 [voice of interpreter] when we're trying to help as many people as possible as quickly as possible, you obviously have to introduce very broad measures that are at the same time robust because we want to be able to deliver thosebenefits to as many people as possible as part of a system that was not actually created tooperate that quickly and as broadly.
So that's the choice that we made.
With the supplement for workers.
We also know that there are people, even though millions of people will be receiving the benefit, we know there are people in particular circumstances who will not qualify for that program.
That's why we're constantly refining the measures to try andfind ways to give help to peoplewho need that help.
We realize that we can't have a perfect system in this kind of unprecedented situation.
We are not aiming for perfection.
We're trying to help as many people as possible as quickly aspossible.
That's why we're constantly announcing new measures to help people.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

With respect, if your goal is to help the widest number of people to make this as broad as possible and you're defending it by saying you needed to have big, bold action, wouldn't the big, bold action be to send everybody help, as opposed to rolling out week by week new changes, various versions of programs in order to fix the gaps that apparently are just coming to the government's attention, that way you wouldn'thave people who are six, seven, eight weeks without income at all?



**Answer**:

We knew from the beginning that we had to make a choice, whether we get big programs out quickly to as many people as possible, or else we figure out how to refine them and get them to the right people.
We made it a double process, a two-program process at large, where, yes, millions of Canadians will receive the $2, 000 every month with the Canada emergency response benefit.
But we also know that there are many Canadians who are middle class for whom $2, 000 a month might not be even nearly enough to cover their needs right now because of various costs, because of various issues they're facing, which is why we wanted to bring in a 75% wage subsidy that will give them instead of $500 a week up to $847 a week.
That is more generous for peoplewho need it. But it is still a significant pay can you tell for everyone.
We understand that this is a situation that is difficult for everyone.
We modelled these programs on a collection of programs that worked in different ways in different countries.
We're confident that we came up with the right measures to help the most Canadians.
As I said, there are people, we recognize, need particular help or don't quite fall into those categories.
That's very much what we're working on now and have been announcing over the past few days in terms of measures we're bringing in for people that workless than 10 hours a week, for example, that will still qualifyfor the CERB.
These are the kinds of things we're continuing to work on.



Thank you.
Next question, operator.



**Operator**:



---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
The question is about the wage subsidy and people looking to wait three to six weeks.
As I understand it, that will not change.
Many businesses are saying that will be too long.
What do you say to them?



**Answer**:

We are working hard to shorten that timeline.
We're aiming for three weeks and we hope to be able to deliver it in three weeks.
Now, of course we have our public servants working very, very hard to deliver the emergency benefit.
Already today millions of Canadians are receiving their money.
It's been an extraordinary amount of work carried out by people who are working and concerned about their family and have continued to work in order to deliver this benefit to Canadians.
Now, they are going to be working on the wage subsidy.
We aim to deliver that program in three weeks, perhaps even earlier if things go according to plan, but we also know that this is a new program.
This is something that's never been done by a government here.
We're confident that we're going to be able to deliver it. [end of translation] we recognize that this is a significant task, but we know that businesses who are making decisions to rehire are stretched thin and need to know that money is going to come in soon from the government.
That's why we are aiming for three weeks in terms of landing the wage subsidy, getting it to Canadian businesses.
It will require a continued herculean efforts by our public servants, particularly at the Canada revenue agency, who have done extraordinary work over these past weeks to deliver the Canada emergency response benefit.
As we've seen, millions of Canadians are beginning to receive that as of today.
This was an unbelievable effort by people who, quite frankly, are facing the same challenges, the same pandemic, the same family issues and worries that the rest of us are facing, but stayed focus on delivering help for Canadians because this was so important at this time.
Now they are going to turn their energies and efforts towards delivering the wage subsidy, which, as I said, we hope to see within the next three weeks.
That is something that we're going to continue working on extremely hard.
That's one of the reasons why we are so eager to see parliament pass the legislation necessary.
I'm certainly hoping that the opposition parties will join me in moving quickly to get this through so we can get help to Canadians.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] with respect to the return of parliament, you said yesterday that the wage subsidy must be approved in the house of commons.
What is causing the delay with the opposition parties?



**Answer**:

Well, we're talking about measures that represent the most extensive measures ever introduced by a government in the history of this country.
We want the opposition parties to be involved in order to get this legislation passed, but also we want them to have a chance to review it and make sure that this is the right way to help Canadians.
If they have questions, well, we're working with them and we hope to be able to work collaboratively with them because everyone agrees that we need to get aid to Canadians.
We'll be working together to make sure we do it right.
[end of translation] these measures are the largest measures passed in decades, if not ever, by a Canadian government.
That's why our democratic institutions and the democratic processes, including parliamentary oversight is extremely important.
That's why we're working with opposition parties to make sure this legislation gets passed quickly but properly, so we can get this help to Canadians in the best possible way.



Thank you.
One more call, operator.



**Operator**:

Next call is from broad forester, aptn.
Your line is open.
Go ahead.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, with various first nations calling for military assistance, at what point does the military agree to go help, number of cases, deaths, per capital? what is the threshold of answering some of these calls for help?



**Answer**:

Obviously we are very concerned with the situation in first nations communities across the country.
Indigenous communities in general, particularly remote and northern ones, are more vulnerable because they often have difficult circumstances, including difficulty around healthcare.
So we recognize that is something we need to focus on. Decisions on how to best help, first of all, we've already allocated millions of dollars to community support programs in indigenous communities.
As for further assistance or military assistance, that will always be made on a case-by-casebasis depending on the individual circumstances and howwe can best help as a government.
That is what we'll always be looking at.



As a follow up.

---

**Question**:

As a follow up, we know, as you say, these communities are Petra dishes and the anishinaabe nation and others have been asking for military aid.
What is your response to their calls to action?



**Answer**:

My response to grand chief fiddler and others is to make sure that -- yes, we're there and want to help.
I know that Minister miller and others have been engaging with leadership across Canada to ensure that what is needed is worked on together.
We recognize the particular and, in some cases, significant needs of -- in many cases significant needs of indigenous communities.
That is something we're working on together.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that our indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, and that's why we continue to work with them.
We have made direct investments in those communities already, but there is certainly more that we can and will be doing.
We'll be working with the leadership and Minister miller is working directly with them to see what we can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and respond if they do have cases.

---

**Question**:

Radio-Canada.
You said that your wage subsidy is not perfect, but why didn't you make things more simple and why didn't you decide instead ofthe CERB in its current form just to send a cheque to everyone? why didn't you make it as simpleas possible so that everyone would get money and nobody wouldbe falling between the cracks?



**Answer**:

There are a lot of people who do not qualify for e. I. there are a number of systems that we looked at and different methods that we examined to try to help people.
and we decided that the Canada emergency response benefit would be the best way to help millions of people.
But as we said, there are people who only work a few hours a week who would have access to that benefit.
We are making the necessary changes to make that happen.
We also know that there are other people in special circumstances, like students, who are facing real challenges in terms of getting summer jobs or part-time jobs.
They need that money to pay their rent and to go back to school in the fall.
So that's why we are continuallylooking at other ways to help.
But the CERB and the wage subsidy together will help millions and millions of Canadians and canadian workers who are facing difficult times.
But we will continue to work to help the most vulnerable.
[end of translation] we recognize that the two measures we've put forward, the wage subsidy and the CERB, will help millions of Canadians, but at the same time we also recognize there are people who will not qualify for either and who need help.
That's why we've announced certain modifications already.
If you're working less than 10 hours a week, we will be tellingyou how you can apply for the CERB.
If you're a student, for example, on top of the Canada summer jobs program that we talked about today, we will be bringing forward more measures because we recognize that without your summer job, withouta source of income over the coming months, including part-time work, you will have trouble paying your rent and trouble paying for your tuition next year.
These are the things we're continuing to work on. We just needed to get the two big measures that would help millions of Canadians out as quickly as possible and chose towork on refining them later.
There is a choice in a crisis around whether you want to move fast or whether you want to get everything absolutely perfect.
In this case we understood that getting help out to Canadians asquickly as possible in a way that is as solid as possible wasextremely important.
We continually work in terms of making sure we're getting peoplewho find themselves in gaps.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] Mr. Trudeau, you say that you want to be quick, but why isn't it quicker for people who don't qualify for the emergency benefit or the wage subsidy that's going to take even longer? now you're going to be going to talk to cabinet later.
Does that mean that working from home is finished?



**Answer**:

No. I will be staying home for most things, but right now from time to time for strategic or important meetings I will be going to parliament to do some work.
But generally speaking, I will continue to work from here, at home and on the phone.
[end of translation] we will -- I will continue to work from home day in and day out, as we're asking most Canadians to do. There will be moments for strategic meetings or particular issues where I will go into the office for meetings, taking all proper precautions, but most of My work will continue to be from home on the telephone.

---

**Question**:

"the globe and mail." for the past few weeks you've said the models that Canada will release will be coming in the coming days.
When will they actually be released?



**Answer**:

We've seen in the last days provinces putting forward their data and modelling.
At the federal level, we put forward updated numbers to be fully transparent with canadianson "the national" picture.
But to be transparent with Canadians on modelling and forecasts, we need to draw on the modelling work the provinces are doing.
Provinces have been releasing this week much more information around their models.
As we collate those and look at those and integrate those into national model, we will have more to say in the coming days.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that people want to know how long this is going to last and what kind of mortality rates could occur.
Every day we are publishing information on Canada.
Ca. a lot of figures are there because we are trying to be transparent and present information from across the country.
At the same time, we know that an umber of provinces did release modelling and projections this week with respect to the future.
If we want to present projections or modelling that is not true or nation-wide, we have to collate all that information or projections from the various provinces.
We will be doing that in the coming days.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

is it more reasonable to say it would be in the coming weeks at this point? the conservatives are calling for a daily question period with the return to parliament.
Do you support that?



**Answer**:

I think it's extremely important that parliament continues to do its work, particularly in a time of crisis.
It is going to be extremely important that we gather to pass important legislation to allow Canadian businesses and workers to be helped by the wage subsidy.
These are things that we're gathering for and working together on. I think that as we asked the speaker a number of days ago, we should look at gathering a virtual parliament.
I think it's important that parliamentarians from every corner of the country, not just those in driving distance of Ottawa, should be able to weigh in on the working of our democracy.
That's why we're looking at virtual models of doing that.
In terms of My own engagement, I'm happy to take questions every day and happy to work withparliamentarians, take questions every day as I do here from media, but I'm also happy to work with parliamentarians to make sure we're continuing to get accountability and get measures for Canadians.
I believe this our democratic institutions, particularly in a time of crisis, and I look forward to working with all opposition parties to make sure we have all systems working in place.
 [voice of interpreter] we know just how important it is to have a properly functioning parliament and to have institutions working in a time of crisis.
So we will be recalling parliament in the coming days to pass legislation to help workers through the wage subsidy.
a number of days ago we asked the speaker of the house of commons to look at virtual ways of recalling parliament, because don't think it's entirely fair that only parliamentarians who are able to come because they live close to Ottawa participate -- can participate in our discussions.
We want to look at ways of engaging all parliamentarians.
We're talking about this with the other opposition parties.
I'm happy to take questions from the media and I'm happy to take questions from the other parties.
We continue our discussion on this.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

I know you're going to be talking about your modelling in the coming days, but from what you've seen, do you have any idea when the virus is going to peak nationally? and also are you concerned about the virus coming in waves that Canadians will be dealing with for many months?



**Answer**:

Excellent question, tom.
We are very much trying to figure out where we are on the curve within the various models.
What is very, very clear is there are significant differences across the country in where various provinces are on their own curves.
Overall as a country, I can say that we have reached the point where we are later than other countries.
We have a glimpse into what is effective and what is working to bend those curves in other countries that we are doing now.
Our social distancing over the past weeks and staying home has been very effective.
Regardless of the model in place, it is clear that the best outcomes come when there is maximal social distancing, as we are pretty close to doing now, as we ramp up testing, because that is an important piece of it and we are continuing to do mo retesting every day, and as we do aggressive contact tracing to make sure those exposed are put into isolation.
These types of things are what'sgiving us the best chance of getting there.
We don't know exactly when we will be peaking, but we do know if we continue to do this, if we continue to do the measures we have in place now, we will get through this much, much quicker.
Once we are through this initialphase, we will then be in a mode until there is a vaccine, which could take many, many months, if not more than a year, to get to. We will be calibrating very carefully our behaviours as a country, as a society, as an economy, to managing the existence and persistent of COVID-19. Better testing, careful isolation of vulnerable communities, measures of gradually bringing back the economy will come.
So if there are spikes, as the data and documentation tells us that we can expect, we are quickly able to adjust and react so none of those spikes over the coming many months that are possible will be anything as serious as this one.
But in order to do that, we have to keep following medical advice, knowing that what Canadians are doing right now, staying home, keeping 2 metres apart, not going out unless you absolutely have to, is what is getting us through this and will ensure that Canadians are kept as safe as possible and our economy comes back as quickly and as strongly as possible.
Let's keep doing what we're doing.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that the measures that we're following now are the correct measures.
We saw this in other countries that are further ahead than we are in terms of the evolution of the pandemic.
We saw that these measures are the best way to reduce the impact and the duration of this pandemic.
We will continue to introduce Otto follow these controls that we put in place.
We don't know exactly when the peak will occur, but if we stay the course now, that can make a big difference.
and in the months and years to come, after we come through this initial phase, there could be a resurgence of the virus here and there in Canada.
But I hope we will be in a position to better control the spread if there are small outbreaks at that point in various places.
So it's -- that's what we're working on right now and we expect to share our projections in the coming days.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

As you spoke about the importance of testing for these models and numbers we're talking about, are you at all concerned that Canada's most populace provinces, lowest in terms of rates but also testing, but some are falling short of Ontario's goals.
What can the federal government do to increase testing in Ontario and other provinces?



**Answer**:

We're working closely with all provincial health authorities to ensure they have the equipment and the ability todo as many tests as possible.
This is an essential part of getting through this phase of the pandemic and, indeed, minimizing further phases of the pandemic over the many coming months.
We continually do more testing every day in this country.
We're already doing better than many, many countries in the world that we compare ourselves to, but at the same time we recognize there is more to do. We will work with jurisdictions that are facing challenges.
We will work together to make sure that we're doing what is needed right across the country to keep Canadians safe.

---

**Question**:

Janet silver, global news.
Public health Canada told the government in early February that more resources for local public health officials were needed to contain the outbreak and enforce a quarantine order.
Why did the federal government not do more to bolster resource sand stop the spread?



**Answer**:

We recognized early on that this was a challenge and we took many measures to try to control or prevent or ensure that Canada was less vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 that we were seeing elsewhere in the world.
With hindsight, I'm sure there were lots of things that we would have done differently, could have done differently.
But I will tell you every step of the way we took the advice of our medical professionals and public health officials seriously and did the test that we could.
Obviously once this is through, there will be many, many people reflecting on different countries' responses and what we need to do to ensure that we are even better prepared next time.
It was certainly something we did and benefit ted from because of the SARS outbreak of 2003 that allowed us to have a number of measures in place that were more effective than some other countries.
But at the same time, there's always more to learn and more todo.

---

**Question**:

There is a poll out today that shows one-quarter of Canadians report they are still not strictly following physical distancing and cities are logging thousands of complaints from residents about people not following the rules.
I'm just wondering, do you have any tools that you're willing touse ts crack down on these people?



**Answer**:

I think one of the things that we have to recognize in this situation is that much of the ability of Canada and of Canadians to get through this Ina's short amount a time as possible and as healthy as possible requires citizens to be doing their part.
We see millions upon millions ofcanadians following the instructions of health Canada officials, of their public health officials in terms of social distancing, staying home, not going out unless they absolutely have to, of doing everything they can to keep our front line workers, from grocery store cashiers to surgeons, as safe as we possibly can.
These are the things we are doing.
Unfortunately there are some people who are not following these instructions and they are putting everyone at risk.
We continue to impress on everyone that we need to do what is necessary to get through this as quickly and as safely as possible.
We will continually work with jurisdictions, with cities, with provinces on new measures or extra measures that they feel are necessary.
As it goes, we're continually monitoring what is needed and what we might need to do as nextsteps.
[ please stand by ]sanders saying he will suspend his campaign, meaning that joe biden is all but confirmed as running for the president.
We will go back to the things we need to tell you about from the Prime Minister.
We'll bring in the host of "power and politics". Vassy kapelos.
You can see there, bernie sanders speaking -- there is a lot going on. a lot going on [laughter]. let's talk about things that Canadians have been waiting to hear from the Prime Minister.
I will add this.
He will actually leave his housetoday to chair a cabinet meetingthat will be held in a secure room, but I would imagine easierto hold a meeting in person.
What stood out for you?



**Vassy**:

a couple of things stood out.
In the remarks the Prime Minister made and the questions that he received, first on the big economic programmes, the wage subsidy as we had anticipated as David reported, the revenue requirements are going to be relaxed.
For example, you would have had to show 30 decline, you can show just a 15% decline and compare it to January and February compared to last year.
If you're a not-for-profit, thisis new, you can also decide whether you want to include it or exclude it when you're makingyour revenue calculations in order to figure out if you're going to qualify for the subsidy.
That is a substantial piece of news.
Caveat to that, this will be part of legislation, that at some point, we don't know when, some point in the not too distant future it will be introduced into the house of commons.
It will be up for debate.
There were questions and answersbetween the Prime Minister and the journalists around the time line.
The conservatives would like more regular question period, accountability, as well more debate on pieces of legislation like this.
They want it to come out faster.
They want the wage subsidy to come out faster.
The Prime Minister is saying three weeks instead of 3-6 weeks.
The Prime Minister did not say whether he was in favour of a daily question period.
He talked about a virtual parliament including more M.P.s. He said he's in favour of the function of parliament, but it wasn't necessarily, okay, yes, we'll have question period.
The other piece of news around students.
This is one of the big groups ofcanadians who felt they were being missed by the CERB, that they couldn't qualify for the $2, 000 a month.
The Prime Minister announced a change to the Canada summer jobsprogramme.
They'll subsidize wages in that programme up to 100%. the whole wage rather than 75%. they anticipate, their estimation, that will create 70, 000 jobs.
They're extending the period to February 28, 2021.
Extension to the end date of employment.
That is substantial as well.
They hope that will address a big need from students.
Not every student.
The final point I'll leave you on, sort of one of the areas we didn't get a lot of clarification.
This is pushed by new democrats.
It folds into the CERB and the coverage of it. There are still a number of people who are missed by that.
The Prime Minister is promising that, for example, people in thegig economy who have lost most but not all of their hours, mostif not all of their income, willbe covered eventually.
He didn't specify how.
New democrats are saying why didn't you just encompass everyone in the first shot? the answer is that the programmethey developed could get the money out fast, which to give them credit for is actually happening, so they chose that over having a perfect programme.
I think there are a number of Canadians who will watch closelyexactly how the programme will be expanded because as of yet, they're not covered.



That's a good point.
The Prime Minister also suggested, rightly, I think that, the wage subsidy programmewill actually be, if companies pick it up, more advantageous tocanadians than a one-time universal income that happens for four months.
There is the issue that not everybody needs the money.
If you send it everywhere, you have to scale it back.
I don't know what is easier, faster, more efficient.



**Reporter**:

This has been the tension on this.
Why not just send $2, 000 to everybody, sort of what we're seeing in the United States, Donald trump is in favour, $1, 000 and then tax it back and get it back from people.
Sounds great.
What if you're Kevin milligan, economist -- what if you're an essential work and you make $40, 000 and next year, $8, 000, you get that taxed.
How easy is it to repay? what are the penalties? the goal has been to be as targeted as possible to ensure that whatever money they send out goes to people who actually need it, rely on it and require it. and that has caused problems.
There is no question about it. It's slower to get out there.
There are gaps in the system.
But there becomes a back end challenge if you put out $6, 000 to people who don't need with the expectation they're going to have to give it back.
You can write it off and give Otto everybody, that makes this become that much more expensive.
That's the challenge there, like the other challenge to get the wage subsidy up and running.
a bit of good news on that, air Canada is going to put 16, 000 people laid off back on payroll because of the wage subsidy.
That's a big deal for these people.
That's $847 a week they can count on for income.
That matters.



You're right.
No system was going to be perfect.
So this is what they've chosen and they're going to work with it for now.
I did have a student on standby, but the ministers are speaking.
I'll get to him if I can, but I'll take you to the deputy Prime Minister.

Hello, everyone.
 a number of COVID-19 cases in Canada.
There are now 18, 000 -- 18, 447 cases, including 401 deaths.
From the labside, we have now completed testing for over 359, 000 people in Canada, maintaining about a 5% confirmed positive rate to track where spread is occurring.
Over the past weeks I've highlighted our key concerns from the first travel-related cases to the onset of community spread to outbreaks in long-termcare facilities, health care settings and vulnerable communities.
We knew from the experience of other countries that this was not going to be easy, but our health system is coping so far.
Maintaining our collective resolve to plank the curve will be a challenge as the weather warms and the holidays approach.

and now we will hear from Minister Carla qualtrough.
C.R.A. please.



Hello, Bonjour.
I'm pleased to join you today to bring two important updates.
First the latest Canada emergency response benefit numbers.
Yesterday, April 7, we received just over 750, 000 new CERB applications.
This brings us to a total of 1.72 million from Monday and Tuesday from this week alone and4.26 million from March 15. To date, we've processed 3.87 million claims.
This means since March 15, millions of Canadians will have seen and seen their first CERB payment of $2, 000.
I want to thank the hard-workingpublic servants of CERB, Canada revenue agency, who have worked tirelessly to deliver this critical programme to Canadians during this crisis.




**Translator**:

At the same time, we have sought to refine our current programmes to help employers adapt to COVID-19's realities.
This morning, the prime ministerannounced temporary changes to the Canada summer jobs programmewith greater flexibility, given to employees to hire young people and students.
and you too --



Summer jobs programme for this year.
These include an increase to the wage subsidy so that private and public sector employees can receive up to 100% of the provincial or territorial minimal hourly wage for each employee and extend to the end date for employment for february28, 2021.
Allowing employers to adapt their employers to support essential services and allowing employers to hire staff on a part-time basis.
These changes will help our small businesses, our local non-profits and keep the workersbeing able to deliver the important essential services in communities across Canada.
They'll help youth stay connected to the labour market, find high quality jobs in safe, inclusive and healthy working environment.




**Translator**:

By adapting the programme this year, the government is ensuring it's supplying the required resources to support our businesses and all Canadians survive the economic impact.







Thank you.
Now over to the president of the treasury board.
Good morning, everybody.
Good afternoon.



Statement this morning is about thanking everyone.




**Translator**:

Particularly as treasury board president to do as ms. Just did, I would like to thank the public servants working in these circumstances.
Given the times we're living in, I would like to thank those working for C.R.A. and service Canada for the remarkable work over the last few weeks in processing nearly 4 million applications for emergency benefits.
I'd also like to thank the chamber of commerce in the country mentioned by My colleague and myself earlier whoare active on behalf of businesses and will be pleased with the greater flexibility brought to the wage subsidy programme as announced by Prime Minister trudeau this morning.
Increased flexibility for businesses in general, but increased flexibility for not-for-profit and charitable organizations who are doing essential work under very difficult circumstances.
So to all of you, thank you.



Thank you.
We have also have with us, Dr. Howe.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.



Thank you.
We have a question from Melanie from la presser.
Go ahead.



**Reporter**:





**Translator**:

First question, idon't know if it's ms. Free land or Mr. Jean-yves Duclos who can tell me about the cost for this broadened wage subsidy programme.
Before you said it would cost $71 billion.
Now we know that new measures were announced this morning.
What is the new cost for this programme?



I'll try to answer.
Thank you fort question.
The goal we saw over the last few weeks was to go rapid and useful.
As we all saw, Prime Minister Trudeau and many of our colleagues were in contact with the business community in order to ensure that this greatest programme to support our businesses functions properly.
The initial budget of $71 billion will of course be renewed now and revised, but what is even more important, this greater eligibility will avoid greater costs in the future because what we must do, and that is the Canadian government's determination, is to avoid allowing this recession to become a depression.
So the solid, robust and rapid intervention such as these measures announced most recently this morning by Prime Minister Trudeau reassures our businesses so they keep their employees and ensure that we come out of this crisis more quickly.
So the absolute essential of this announcement is making the wage subsidy more flexible.
The objective is to make sure we have all the tools we need to prevent the recession from becoming a depression.
a recession becomes a depression when a government doesn't take immediate, quick and solid actions in response to a severe economic situation like the one year currently experiencing.
So obviously, the prior estimate of the cost of the wage subsidy will be reviewed and revised by the Minister of finance, but what is more important now is that we understand that more businesses, more non-profit organizations, more charitable organizations will be able to benefit more quickly and more importantly from the wage subsidy.



Thank you, Minister.
Question, yes, I understand Minister Duclos, but to understand it is $71 billion, is it going to be a higher amount? how much higher? will we find out today and the follow up is for ms. Freeland.
Yesterday you said that the expected shipments that were held up because of the presidential decree were being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
How many companies based in the United States have had to cease exportingmasks? and how many masks have Canada been deprived of because of thatmeasure?



Answer.
Canada was not deprived of masksbecause of president trump's decree.
With respect to 3m's masks, the first batch of masks arrived in Canada last night at 11:20 p. M. those masks are now here in Canada.
We are now organising the distribution of those mks across the country.
and I am so pleased to be able to tell you this.
I know that people who are working in our health care sector desperately need these masks and I'm so happy that theywill be able to receive them very soon.
These masks are so important andnecessary for them.
and I want to tell all those working in health care in Canada, thank you so much.
With respect to the relationshipbetween Canada and the United States, when it comes to medicalsupplies, we have a very complexrelationship in that area, just like every other industry.
It's not just an issue of finished products, it's about all of the required elements to produce a mask.
For example, our ventilators.
It's also an issue of services.
I can assure you that Canada wasvery organized and very clear inexplaining the interdependence of our relationship to our american partners.
I'm very pleased that the 3m masks are now in Canada and we will continue to work with our american partners and companies and government in order to ensure supplies are available here in Canada and also to reassure our american partners that all the things they need from Canada will also be supplied to the United States.
So let me be clear.
There is not a single mask as far as I'm aware.
There might be orders done by provinces or hospitals that I'm not aware of, but we've been encouraging provinces and hospitals to get in touch with the federal government if they're having any concerns, anyissues in the United States or anywhere in the world.
It's a very complicated situation in the whole world andthere is a real race on internationally for medical equipment.
But when it comes to the masks, we had the statement from 3m on Monday.
The masks crossed the United States border into Canada at around 11:20 p. M. last night.
They are here.
and we are working as quickly aspossible to get them distributedaround the country to our heroichealth care workers who need them so urgently.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.
The next question is from Kim from the "wall street journal". your line is open.



**Reporter**:

Hi, thank you.
This question is for the deputy Prime Minister.
Can you tell me what Canada considers support for president trump's proposal for imposing tariffs on oil from Saudi arabiaif talks between OPEC countries break down?



Canada is very engaged in collaboration with the United States at the g20 level as well in working on the situation in the global oil market.
We are working -- the federal government is working very closely on this with the province of Alberta and with premier Jason Kenny who has been really personally engaged as well.
and our energy Minister sea mus o'regan and Sonya savage have been involved.
All of us have been in close touch with the partners because of the integration of the north American market and energy production and we're obviously also working on it at the g20 level and with other global oil producers.
I think Canadians all appreciate that some of the actions by Russia and Saudi Arabia have had unfortunate consequences on the global oil market.
and that is something that is working collaboratively.
We are seeking to ameliorate.



**Reporter**:

Thanks.
Can you speak specifically to the question of tariffs, are tariffs on oil from Saudi arabiasomething Canada would consider supporting?



I chose My words carefully.
We are very focused on this issue.
It's an important issue for Canada and the world.
We are working closely -- the federal government is working closely with the province of Alberta on this.
The province of Alberta is quite correctly very directly engaged and involved.
and the federal government and the province of Alberta are working closely with our United States neighbours, specifically because of the highly integrated nature of the north American energy market and we're working on it with energy producers globally.
The current situation is a real problem for Canada and we are working to find ways to resolve it.



Thank you.
Next question on the phone.



The next question is from 



**Reporter**:

Hello, I have a question for Minister Duclos.
Many people told us they received much more than the $2, 000 expected amount for the CERB.
Can you explain what is going onto us and reassure us that we'renot seeing another phoenix take place?



Answer.
Thank you for the question.
Two very important things first of all, the system is working surprisingly well.
Of course, the government and the public servants have worked very hard to make sure the system did work well and we did want to make sure that it was going to be operating properly.
So C.R.A. and service Canada employees are ensuring we can receive and process a number of applications that are about 25 times the normal level of what we would have be receiving and processing rather.
Secondly, the system is also retroactive, too.
So some people received retroactive payments, too, because the CERB is retroactive to March 15. and then there is a payment in advance, let's call it a perspective payment, as of april11, since the first period was March 15 to April 11. Now if people are concerned or uncertain, it's important to be prudent.
People must understand that -- must know it's $2, 000 per month.
Independently of whether or not you received another payment.
So if you received two, it's possible that one of them was a retroactive payment for March 15to April 11 and the second one is as you're going forward from April 11.



Follow up question.
When it comes to the wage subsidy, the fact there is ongoing negotiations that are going on between the opposition parties and the government, is this going to delay the implementation of this highly anticipated programme?



As the Prime Minister was saying this morning, we know that both programmes, both the wage subsidy and the emergency benefits are programmes that arecomplementary.
This week, we saw how essential the emergency benefit was since we've already received 4 million applications and many of those have already been processed, but we know that the emergency wage subsidy is also very important which is why Mr. Trudeau and the house leader and all the ministers around the table are working hard with the other opposition parties to ensure that parliament can be recalled to pass this important legislation as quickly as possible, which is absolutely essential to ensure that the wage subsidy can go forward.



**Reporter**:

Could you repeat the answer in English?



On the first question, for all Canadians and the issue is very important.
It's two sided issue.
The first one is that the canadaemergency response benefit not only we knew it would be important, but we now have the confirmation it is absolutely important for millions of Canadians and the good news here is that the system is working due to the hard work of a large number of public servants.
The second thing we need to be mindful of, that all Canadians need to be reminded of, this is $2, 000 per four weeks.
So there are Canadians that have received a retroactive payment dating from March 15, because that is when the benefit can be applied.
So from March 15 to April 11 is the first four-week period during which a $2, 000 payment would have been made maybe yesterday or perhaps today.
So that is $2, 000 for the first payment.
Some Canadians have already received a $2, 000 for the secondpayment of four weeks, which is starting on April 11. But let us be very clear.
It's $2, 000 per month.
So if people have received two payments, one retroactively and one prospectively, everybody needs to manage his or her budget on the understanding it's$2, 000 per month regardless of when the $2, 000 is actually deposited into his or her bank account.



Thank you, Minister.
I want to switch to the room.
Starting with Julie from CBC.



**Reporter**:

Yes, I'm just wondering about the wage subsidy.
I guess maybe from Minister Duclos, they're waiting for this wage subsidy.
Obviously you need parliament to pass it. Air Canada talked about applying for it today.
What is the fastest that they can have this money? I think the Prime Minister said something about three weeks.
The think the opposition says six.
is there a concern that many businesses won't be able to hangon?



Minister morneau has highlighted a strong economic plan that has three legs to it. The first is secure workers.
The second is to secure liquidities and the second is to secure businesses so they can keep paying their workers.
That's the most important objectives of the Canada emergency response benefit.
Securing liquidities with the Canada business account, which is right now as we're speaking, allowing businesses, in particular small and medium-sized businesses to access $40, 000 imagine loan withno interest for the next two years.
That provides urgent liquidity to secure businesses.
and the second thing is the emergency wage subsidy.
So these emergency wage subsidies, that programme is being implemented in different ways.
First in terms of legislation and that is absolutely essentialdo because it does require important legislative changes onwhich we're working with opposition parties.
and the second thing, while we do this, we obviously are preparing the public service forthe delivery of that important wage subsidy.
But, of course, the actual delivery must wait for the decision as a democracy requires, a decision of parliament.



**Reporter**:

What is the holdup? why isn't the house sitting right now to pass this?



Maybe I will speak to that.
As explained, this is a very important programme.
This is the largest economic measure Canadians have put forward.
For that reason, we believe that parliament needs to have its say about it. We're a parliamentary democracy and that part of the oversight is crucial.
House leaders from all parties are negotiating right now for how parliament can come back to debate this legislation.
and we very much hope that will happen quickly and we very much hope that legislation will be supported.
As you said in your question, Julie, this is support that Canadian businesses urgently need.
and that Canadian workers urgently need so they can keep their jobs and keep food on the table.
So we're working very energetically with the opposition parties to bring parliament back.
That is an essential step.
I'm hopeful it will happen really soon.



I'm being asked for you to repeat that in french.




**Translator**:

Answer repeated in french.
The wage subsidy is a very powerful measure on the part of our government.
We believe it is the greatest measure ever taken by a canadiangovernment.
Because of that, it's absolutely necessary and appropriate that parliament have the opportunity to consider this measure at the same time we do understand the urgency of the measure for Canadian businesses and for Canadian workers to receive this support from the government.
That is why the leaders of all the political parties are working extremely hard -- I worked very late last night with house leader Pablo Rodriguez about this work.
Which is required to recall parliament to consider this measure.
I hope we will benefit from the goodwill of all political parties.
I think all Canadians understand how urgent this measure is and ID hope we have the opportunity to debate it and to move very quickly on this measure.



Thank you.
This question is for you to start.
You both said over a period of time that testing is an important part to coming to conclusion on the pandemic.
When we look at Ontario, they only tested 2500 people yesterday, that's below the daily goal of 5, 000 tests.
Are you concerned about Ontario's testing level? are we concerned about a lack of test kits.



I'll start with the last part of the question first and turn to Dr. Tam about how testing strategies are created.
The short answer is no, tests aren't being withheld.
The testing strategy that Dr. Tam has worked out with her counterparts across the provinces and territories is to get to the volume we need to, to ensure we have a good understanding of what the disease presentation is, but also targeted so we're using the tests in the best way to determine the hot spots that we see across the provinces and territories and the risk of the disease in vulnerable populations.
So I'll turn to Dr. Tam to speak with Ontario particularly and anything else she'd like to add.



Yes.
Different jurisdictions do have different laboratory testing rates, so the number of tests per capital.
That might be as a result of where they are in the epidemic curve, but I do agree we need to increase our laboratory testing in Canada writ large, but certainly for jurisdictions that experience the most activity.
So what we're doing is not just providing a consensus on guidance on who to test, but really looking at every stream of testing capacity, whether it's pcr, to increase that.
I know Ontario is trying to improve that as they're going along with that to help as much as possible.
But also testing on the newer capabilities like the patient test that is important for different areas of Ontario.
Ontario is a very big jurisdiction.
and so we're working really tightly with the provincial laboratories, but again, it's like other supplies.
We're pulling out every stop to get as much as testing capacity as possible in Canada.
There is variations in terms of lab testing rates across the country.



On a follow-up. Over the past week or so, the "washington post", bloomberg hasreported that china has underreported the death rate.
The United States has intelligence they've done that as well.
We asked the health Minister andshe said that the data out of china in terms of the rates of infection and death rates were falsified in any way.
As a five eyes partner, have we seen the intelligence that the United States has and personally, do you believe the numbers that china has put out around COVID-19?



So, let me start by talking about our collaboration with theW.H.O. This is a global pandemic and Canada absolutely understands that a global response to it is essential.
The multilateral organization charged with coordinating that global response is the W.H.O. and when it comes to data from various countries and when it comes to the multilateral effortaround that, the W.H.O. and our own health experts who work closely with the W.H.O. Are where we turn.
Having said that, Canada is a very energetic member of the five eyes and we have a close and very important security and intelligence partnership with the United States in the five eyes, in nato and in nor ad. So of course, we do share intelligence information throughthe five eyes.
The five eyes are charged with doing that.
and we have very frequent security and intelligence conversations with the United States.
Are reason that we are able to have those conversations, which are very important in the crisisthat the world is experiencing today, is because those conversations have been in private and so I am not able to share details of what is discussed in those conversations.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, guys.
So let's talk about non-COVID-19 patients.
I've been hearing of major surgeries that have been postponed and doctors, clinic doctors, who are deferring people until a late date.
But if this takes month, what implications is that of deferring our health care until this clears up in the future?



So I'll start and then I'll turn to Dr. Tam for obviously the work she's doing with our colleagues.
First of all, I want to thank all of the health care practitioners across the country who are making these very difficult decisions about which procedures to postpone, how to manage clients -- or people, patients, that are ill with a variety of severity of illnesses, including mental illness by the way, which is another area that we haven't talked a lot about, but in fact, patients are having a hard time accessing professionals in the area of mental illness as well.
These are difficult times.
and these are difficult heart-wrenching decisions and they're not taken lightly I knowat any level of decision-making, whether it is provincial guidance provided through ministries of health or the local level as hospitals and practitioners continue to try totreat patients and continue preparing for a surge in the hospital setting.
I want to thank them for that hard work.
I know as Canadians are struggling and suffering and postponing surgeries, some of usmight not think they're essential, but they're in essential in their own lives, these are tremendous sacrifices.
But also the health care professionals whose entire liveshave been helping people in crisis and are now struggling todo that, we owe them a debt of gratitude for these difficult decisions they're making.
Maybe, Dr. Tam, you can talk about the guidance at the national level in preparing for surge.



I think it's very dynamic situation in different province sand territories, but what the chief medical officers are seized with is not only trying to ascertain impact of the actual public health measures, reducing the impact of the COVID-19 itself, but what are the other consequences, negative consequences of our measures, and that is the area that we want to obviously focus on. I think everybody's attention right now is to get past that initial peak so everything will be done and whenever that is, is dependent on our action now.
Right now is a really critical time for jurisdictions, provinces and territories are looking well, when can this resume? I think they will be looking at -- until you're past that peak, you can't really provide those kind of dynamic decisions, but that's the -- exactly the kind of thing they're looking at right now, how do we resume these without impacting the capacity to cope with the COVID-19 patients? it's an incredible question and one that is on top of their minds for sure.



I just got a new one in. An dipsos poll suggests one-thirdof Canadians reported they are not following the social distancing advice of public health officials.
Cities across the country have logged thousands of reports of people not following the rules.
Do you have any tools left that you're willing to use to crack down on people refusing to social distance?



So, at the federal level, obviously, we have certain jurisdictional responsibilities and that is largely supporting provinces and territories in dealing with federal borders and many of the tools we have, we used to varying degrees as varying times and of course we rely on the special advisor committee of public health officials to talk about additional tools that could be imposed.
But if you look at that statistic, what it says to me is75% of Canadians are following social distancing.
Of course, it's challenging for a variety of people to do that for a variety of different reasons.
We continue to add measures and encourage people to do that and at provincial and municipal levels there are a whole bunch of tools implemented, from fines, to phone lines for people to call.
I think Dr. Tam's last answer ISS very important thing to reflect on. The tools that we use have to be commensurate with the risk and have to be applied in a way thatdon't increase suffering in people's lives to the degree that have long lasting impacts.
We can see that the world is in a difficult place.
We're trying as best as we can to be a global pandemic -- beat a global pandemic, a virus which there is no cure and there is no vaccine for, using, I would say, relatively primitive tools.
Tools that have been used over centuries to prevent the spread of disease.
So as we do that and as we apply additional measures, we have to be extremely thoughtful about how we do that to get to the intended public health goal which is to reduce the spread and actually save lives, but also understand the long lasting implications in other peoples' live and have kindness and patience with people as they learn to live in a new way.



I would look at it from two directions.
One is supporting people to better social distance or self-isolate.
For example, we're looking at, well, do we need to provide alternative accommodations for people who can't self-isolate appropriately at home? so working with the provinces, looking at that isolation plan.
So they can't self-isolate at home, let's help them.
So lots of these measures to help may be nudging and other tools, apps are being study, howcan we encourage people to know they're not social distancing.
You may have seen the google work looking at, in fact, Canada, many areas of Canada, we've really fundamentally reduced our mobility.
In a whole north american context.
Our province is at the top of reduction in mobility for example.
So that's innovative tools tell us how the public health measures are working.
Then on the other side, in termsof compliance, as we follow up people and check in on them, sometimes we find that we can't reach them.
and we have tools to of course work with our peace officers to try and find them so they will know this is a really serious thing we're talking about.
We have a mandatory order on self-quarantine when you enter Canada and this is serious and we mean to look at compliance for that.
So we do, every day, find peoplewho haven't answered their phonecalls and have to be chased down.
Every province, every municipality is applying some measure of that concept.
But when needed, some of these fines and compliance measures are there for an added bit of a serious message, I think.



Thank you.
I'll turn back to the phone for two more questions and that's all the time we have for today.



Thank you.
The next question is from -- 







**Translator**:

Question, My question is for you.
Earlier you said during the press conference that Canada was deprived of no masks by americancompanies exporting into our country, but I would like to know what about the future? are we to understand that the whole issue of president trump'sdecree is resolved? the white house seems to be suggesting that the decree were not applicable to exports to Canada.
Can you tell us whether you received our own insurances from the American administration this has been resolved?



Answer, thank you for the question, and as to the masks, Will say as said in English, with respect to the purchases that we've already made, I do have information about those.
There may be other purchases by provinces and hospitals, but I do want to assure you and tell you right now that -- and tell all provinces and hospitals that the federal government is here to help the provinces and help our hospitals in making these purchases outside the country.
We are moving ahead.
We have excellent ambassador in the United States, in china, across the world and we're working in close collaboration with provinces and even certain hospitals to make these purchases.
With respect to the United States, and the issue of purchasing medical supplies from the United States, this is an issue we are currently discussing and resolving.
All Canadians now know that we did have issues around the purchase of the 3m masks, but we are resolving many other specific issues as well.
I would like to emphasize that we have had and are continuing to have a conversation on several other levels with respect to this issue with our American partners.
We've explained that when it comes to medical services, like all of the relationships, various relationships we have with the United States is a reciprocal relationship.
It is a relationship that is truly interdependent.
We need the United States, but at the same time, they need us, too.
We explained that and we made the argument that a win-win solution is in the interest of both countries.
I think that we did -- that we were understood by our american partners and counterparts.
At the same time, we have to continue to work on this issue.
It is a very difficult situationfor all countries in the world, including Canada and included the United States.
It's a crisis and we have to work on daily basis and hourly basis and keep working.
That's what we must do. and I must also have emphasize how important the premiers and the provinces' role is. This is an issue we're all working together on as team Canada.
Thank you so much.



**Reporter**:

Follow-up question.




**Translator**:

My follow-up question is, as follows, I want to be clear where we're at then.
Was there progress made beyond the 3m case? you said you were working on it case-by-case approach with companies.
You said you're working on otherspecific issues, what does that mean? does that mean since yesterday you reached an agreement with certain companies to be exemptedfrom the trump administration decree? and if so, how many companies and how many supplies?



Answer.
I do not wish to get into the details of the specific cases, but I can tell you that up until now we have managed to resolve the issues.
and that we will have to continue to do that work.
and that's quite normal.
Trade relationships require persistent work and Canada know show to do that and Canada will continue to do so. So we are pleased with the resolution of the situation with3m.
and we are delighted that the first part of Canada's order from 3m has been resolved and those 500, 000 masks are here in Canada.
More broadly, we have been making the case for many days now to our american partners that when it comes to medical equipment and services, the relationship between Canada and the United States is truly reciprocal.
We are dependent on one another and both countries will be best served if we can continue to work together.
That is an argument we have beenmaking speaking about some very specific examples of the role Canada plays in the United States medicalrole and the United States health care system.
Thus far, we have been met with real comprehension from our american partners, both in the administration and also at the business level, because americanbusinesses really understand theextent to which the supply chains are interdependent.
This is work that is constant and we just have to keep at it and, by the way, that is the nature of our trading relationship with the United States in general.
That it requires constant work, constant gardening.
and in this time of a true global pandemic of a real crisis, it requires particular attention and we are devoting absolutely that necessary attention to it.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
One last question.
Operator?



Thank you.
The next question is from althiaraj from the "huffpost".



> thank you, I think My question is for Minister Duclos or Freeland.
I would like to know if cabinet considered a broad-based universal payment approach of the way of catching all canadianworkers whose income may have been affected by COVID-19? and if you did consider it, why did you rule it out?



Thank you for the question.
If I may answer very broadly, but as as well, quite specifically.
What we are seeing in the context of this emergency is that our social security system wasn't designed and therefore wasn't prepared to handle such an emergency situation.
Now we know before the crisis that there were some holes in our social security system due in part to the changing demographics and the changing work circumstances of many Canadian workers.
So there are obviously lessons that we are learning and that we will be learning over the next few weeks and months as to how we will as a country emerge with not only a better understanding of the vast diversity of Canada and Canadians, but also the vast -- the considerable importance that the federal government needs to keep playing when it comes to securing not only the livelihoods, but the ability of everyone to participate fully in our economy both in crisis but also outside of crisis.
[please stand by]



If you did consider it, what were the things you decided would rule that option out?

Well, I would remind everyone that what we are doing is rather universe because we are universally supporting workers, both that would have perhaps been able to receive support from employment insurance, but also those that would not be able to receive support.
We are working in an emergency situation, where we are doing things that Canada and canadianshave never done.
The e. I. system was not designed for that.
We have put in place a system at relatively high speed and with relatively good would beings, where we see millions of Canadians being given emergency assistance in a context where millions of Canadians need and demand that assistance.
So we are demonstrating, as we were together, we're listening and inputting the advice of many people outside of the government.
We can do great things in canadaand great things as Canada, in particular doing things that are quite universe in their nature at the particular moment.



I just want to add one point about the wage subsidy program and a particular advantage that it offers and the reason this ISS program we are really delighted to be offering to Canadians.
The wage subsidy program offering on top of the CERB a particular benefit and that is -- two particular benefits.
First, it helps to retain that crucial link between employers and their job.
That is absolutely essential psychologically for people, to know you are not only having an income, but you have a job that is still there.
It is also crucial in terms of the ability of businesses to keep going and to remain operational and for us collectively, therefore, to be in a position to come roaring back economically when we are able to relax the essential health measures that are in place right now.
So I would really like canadiansnot to understate the value of the particular structure of the wage subsidy program.
This is going to maintain that essential connection between people and their jobs and it is going to help businesses remain fully functional and intact.
It is a great program, and we all really, really hope that parliament will come together soon to support this program and to keep Canadian companies and the Canadian economy strong through this difficult time.
Thank you.
