He is expected to talk about tweaks to the Canada emergency response benefit to help a broader swath of individuals for people who say the CERB doesn't help them, university students, for instance, who are usually lining up for jobs at this time of year.
The application process for the CERB opened up on Monday, and dozens and dozens of you have told me, at least on Twitter, that you have received your $2, 000 in your bank accounts this morning.
We also learned that federal finance Minister bill morneau and other ministers will hold a press conference in a couple of hours from now and they will talk about the wage subsidy bill.
That's at 1:30. Let me bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and David Cochrane.
Good to see both of you.
This will be significant hopefully for students today, Vassy, because many of them have been talking about how they feel they are in a difficult position not being able to get work and maybe didn't work during the school year and need money for the fall.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, exactly, and even if they did work during the school year, they didn't make $5, 000, which is the threshold for accessing the CERB.
Many of them have been counting on the money from the summer to pay for their tuition and whatever they need to. I have heard, you have heard, CBC has heard from tons of students who feel they have gone unaddressed so far.
The Prime Minister is expected to announce a retooling of the summer jobs program, aimed at matching students who would be looking for work with industries that require help, essential services.
It's in the tens of thousands, the numbers of students that could access those kinds of jobs.
That's what I'm anticipating.
and that addresses a portion of the gaps we are missing with thecerb.
The other portion of people who are in the gig economy who have a bit of work button haven't entirely lost their income, the Prime Minister did say earlier in the week they would be addressed.
My understanding is those details are still being worked on, so we won't expect anything.
The wage subsidy will be a discussion.
We heard Pierre poiliÈvre earlier in the week.
This is turning out to be a more robust discussion in parliament.
There seems to be a desire of the opposition parties to hold more regular sessions of accountability through question period or others.
There have been some changes to the draft legislation to better address some of the complaints that we have been hearing so frequently from businesses around the revenue requirements.
They had to show in this month of March compared to last year their revenues were down at least 30%. because of the timing of the outbreak of the pandemic and the restrictions on those requirements, there is said to be some flexibility, some of our colleagues are reporting some flexibility in what the government is about to introduce.
The conservatives and other opposition parties are asking for even more flexibility.
That is something to keep our eye on.



**Rosemary**:

Also interesting air Canada said it would be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep I think 36, 000 employee son its payroll, which is interesting, given the struggling nature of the airlineindustry.
David, over to you on what you're expecting or hearing.



**David**:

The bit about what Vassy said about the flexibility.
We've confirmed independently what our colleagues reported on this.
To make it easier businesses only need to show a reduction of15%. the lock downs really only started midmonth.
They said it is unfair to have the 30% hurdle.
Also if you don't have a last March, some companies could have started up after that, you can compare your revenue to January and February as the benchmark for the drop.
These are things they've done and allowing a cash accounting method versus an accrual method that should capture more companies.
Already Dan Kelly from the independent federation of business is praising this as a positive step forward.
There are concerns that it doesn't go far enough because when you make policy this big this fast, some things get missed.
When this was originally rolled out I interviewed a restaurant other than who opened in March.
January and February sounds great as a comparison point, but what was going on in st. John's? about a million feet of snow fell there.
There are localized circumstances that every time you try to fix something, you will stumble across this.
The opposition parties are stillnegotiating.
We heard Pierre poiliÈvre say they want to make it easier for businesses to qualify.
They also want it fast.
The corporate sector, small, medium, large haven't been getting any money.
The CERB is working quickly, but this not so much.



**Rosemary**:

Back to the CERB.
If you had qualified for employment insurance or you had sent in an application for employment insurance after march15, you were automatically moved over to the CERB.
What you see in your bank account within three days, it will be the CERB and not e. I., although there are some reports that people are getting both.
I'm guessing you won't be able to keep all that.
From a logistical perspective, it does seem to be working.
I will leave you because I believe we have our first guest, the premier of British Columbia, john Horgan.
Good to see you and thank you for making the time.



**Premier John Horgan**:

Good morning, Rosie.



**Rosemary**:

Premier, how is the province doing? we hear these stories of a glimmer of hope and maybe turning a corner.
How would you characterize it?



**Premier John Horgan**:

We're optimistic.
We've seen a declined in the number of cases and a reduction in the hospitalization and reduction of the I. C.u. Patients.
These are all good indications, but we're far from out of the woods yet.
We have direction from the public health officials that we need to stay the course.
With the weekend and good weather coming up, we're going to push that, but so far so good.



**Rosemary**:

What do you think made the difference? at one point in time it seemed like the cases were rising quickly, but now it seems like Ontario and quÉbec are the ones struggling.
What measures made the difference in your province?



**Premier John Horgan**:

Well, I think we were fortunate, rosemary, in that we had an outstanding public response.
My Minister Adrian dicks brought these to cabinet in January.
We have the lunar celebrations in January which are extremely large.
a fraction of the people showed up because of the concerns of the virus coming from china.
We have not had a confirmed case coming from china since valentine's day.
We have seen a growth of cases from community transmission.
We had a significant outbreak inwashington state as well, in late February, which really focused the minds of British columbians.
It was just across the 49th parallel.
People rallied to the call of action and the stay-at-home orders given by public health officials.
As a result of that, we've seen a positive outcome.
As Dr. Henry said yesterday, a little bit of good luck and beginning this process before other provinces put us in a goodposition today.



**Rosemary**:

You did have some criticism around the border issue when that outbreak happened.
You were concerned that the decision to make Americans exempt from crossing was going to lead to further problems for your province.
I know that just last week your government expressed concerns that Canadians being repatriated, of which there werethousands, were just being told to quarantine and were not beingscreened.
Have you managed to push that forward with the government?



**Premier John Horgan**:

We have.
We will be making an announcement later in the day.
The province will step in and fill some of the gaps the federal government is not able to fill at this time.
I wouldn't offer criticism on that.
We have been persistent and constant on the need to ensure we are not introducing new cases into British Columbia we will be making an announcement about yvr, the border to the south.
But we're writing this as we go, as you know.
I'm optimistic that we will have good announcement today and more to come.



**Rosemary**:

Without you having to pre-empt yourself, do you mean you will be screening people who are coming in from repatriated flights or elsewhere?



**Premier John Horgan**:

We want to make sure everyone has a plan to self-isolate, not just, yeah, I'll do that, but a plan.
We'll have a significant form.
As you know, if you travel internationally, you have to fill something out, a small document.
It will be a larger document coming into British Columbia.
I expect Minister Freeland will be working in the same vein as Ontario and quÉbec.
We will be leading the w in British Columbia, because we've been persistent on this.
The federal government recognizes this as a challenge and they're working with us to resolve the issues.
I wish we had done it a week ago, but hindsight you can always say you could do better opinion the level of cooperationis unprecedent ped.
My colleagues, premiers across the country, you know the political cleavages between various provinces and various political alignments in our provinces across the country have all been washed away and we're working co-operatively, focused on results for Canadians.
It's really aspiing to participate in. I'm humble to have a role in this at this point in time.
It is a significant challenge.
We won't get through this unlessthe public is with us. So far so good.



**Rosemary**:

That is encouraging.
I want to ask you about long-term care homes.
In this province in Ontario, they still have not put in placethe measure that you put in place, where a worker was not the allowed to work in more thanone place.
How significant a public health measure do you think that was?



**Premier John Horgan**:

It's significant and there are a lot of reasons why the long-term care sector? British Columbia has a workforcethat has to work in two and three homes.
We want to take steps to reversethat.
This is policy from governments going back a decade and a half.
This is an attempt to correct that.
We've seen results in a tragic pandemic environment in that policy.
We've taken steps to reduce the number of interactions with careaids and other healthcare workers from home to home.
Regrettably 43 of the fatalities in British Columbia have been incare homes.
It's obvious that's a place we need to focus our attention.
Again, we got on that early.
I encouraged My colleagues at the council of federation to follow suit and many of them have.



**Rosemary**:

Your provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, who's become a bit of a celebrity in this country, when she's doing her modelling or forecast, and she's going to do another, she's been resistant to put on fatalities as opposed to Ontario and quÉbec.
Are you going to ask her to do that? is there pressure for you guys to release those kinds of numbers?



**Premier John Horgan**:

Well, I don't feel any pressure to do that.
I have complete confidence in Dr. Henry.
The objective in her mind and in my mind of the modelling is to prepare our acute care system to address illness, not to give counts of potential fatalities.
It's to prepare for the volume of people who will be coming into the system.
The modelling helps us determine how much P.P.E. We need, how many ventilators we need, do we've enough space in the various health authorities in British Columbia in the event ofa crush.
We've seen that the curve is starting to bend here in British Columbia we're very encouraged by that.
I don't believe there is any value in further frightening british columbians.
We need to use the modelling forpractical reasons and make sure the system is prepared.
That's what the modelling has been and will be in British Columbia



**Rosemary**:

This hope and optimism that you and Dr. Henry have at least at the beginning of the curve flattening, are you concerned that people will read that in the wrong way and be a little too or more relaxed about physical distancing and other measures dism.



**Premier John Horgan**:

I am concerned about that.
The weather is spectacular in southern British Columbia here today.
It is forecast to be great during the Easter long weekend.
We're concerned that the people here will take too much from what they've seen and lighten upon their isolation.
We will encourage people to stay home and stay the course.
We are 100% committed to each other.
We need to be committed to our healthcare workers.
The only way we're going to get back to a sense of normalcy is if we continue to follow the guidelines put in place by Dr. Henry, even on the sunny days in British Columbia, we need to focus on staying away from other people, washing our hands, making sure that if we don't have tobacco outside, we're not outside.



**Rosemary**:

I'm waiting for the prime Minister.
I only have about a minute, premier.
How are you holding up because it's a lot for everyone to sort of manage.
How are you doing?



**Premier John Horgan**:

Oh, I'm fine.
As I said, it's a real honour and a privilege to be in a position to effect positive change.
You don't plan for a pandemic.
You don't plan for the challenges we've faced in British Columbia over the past number of years.
The worst-ever fire season -- successive fire seasons, floods, now pestulents, I'm waiting for the frogs to come.
I'm inspired by the people.
Just the nooir season in 2017 was enough.
a worse season in 2018.
Flood season, blockages in the river for salmon.
Harold mcmillan said, events, dear boy, you can have the best plans in the world, but you have to deal with the here and now.
I'm proud of how the people of British Columbia have responded.
Right across the country, it's interesting to see people from different political perspectivesand regions, putting aside all of those historic grievances that we as Canadians have with each other to come out better off at the end of the day.
That's important.



**Rosemary**:

Premier Horgan, very good of you to make the time and wishing the province all the best as you continue to flatten the curve.
Everyone stay healthy out there.
Thank you.



**Premier John Horgan**:

Thank you, Rosie.
Have a good day.



**Rosemary**:

That's British Columbia premier john Horgan in Victoria.
Later today he will make an announcement for further screening measures for people coming into his province becausebritish Columbia is the province that is having some success in, as you heard there, flattening the curve, part of it to do with the public health measures they took and also the increased screening they put in place in other provinces.
Here now the province of Canada.
