Whether combatting terrorism, supporting our allies or peace operations around the world, they do what they always do, step towards danger so the rest of us can stay safe.
Operation reassurance is Canada at its best, bolstering securityand stability in central and eastern europe.
Here at home we turn to the forces and times of flood, fire or other natural disasters.
They never say no. They always put their shoulders to the wheel.
and now, as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic, the canadian armed forces are on the front lines in our seniors homes helping to protect and care for our most vulnerable citizens.
Even as up to 915 soldiers are deployed on operation reassurance in europe, reinforcing nato's collective defence, the caf will soon have more than 500 serving in 13 long-term care facilities in andaround montreal.
and more will go in as they are prepared for this work.
Earlier this week caf teams weredeployed to assist in five long-term care facilities in Ontario.
These people are working day andnight helping to protect our parents, our uncles, our aunts and our grandparents.
[ voice of interpreter ]at this time of grief, the womenand the men of the canadian armed forces keep their heads high, proudly bearing the maple leaf.
They are recognized worldwide asmodels of civility, compassion and courage.
Whether they are called to combat terrorism, to stand alongside our partners and allies, or during peace operations, they do what they are used to doing.
They step towards danger to ensure our security.
We turn to them in Canada when there is a flood, a forest fire or another natural disaster.
They never say no. They are always ready.
and now, as we're facing a pandemic, the canadian armed forces are once again here for us. They are taking care of our seniors.
They are helping out at seniors homes.
915 soldiers are currently participating in operation reassurance and soon there will be more than 500 members of the canadian armed forces in long-term care homes in montreal, and others will join them soon.
Earlier this week members of thecaf were deployed in five long-term care facilities in Ontario.
Our members work day and night to protect our parents, our aunts and uncles and grandparents.
They deserve our recognition.
