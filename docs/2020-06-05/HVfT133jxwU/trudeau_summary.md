### Summary:



Videos and reports that have surfaced from across the country over the past few days are disturbing, and they bring to light the systemic realities facing far too many Canadians.
We need to ensure that each of these individual cases is investigated properly, but we also need a larger reflection on changing the systems that do not do right by too many indigenous people and racialized Canadians. Or covering the cost of support workers, many Canadians with disabilities are facing unexpected bills that can be hard to pay.
To help cover these costs, todayi can announce that we're introducing a one-time, non-taxable payment of up to $600 for Canadians with disabilities.
We're establishing a national workplace accessibility stream to help people with disabilitiesfind and keep a good job.
and we're funding five new projects across the country thatwill help people get supportive devices to overcome barriers in the workplace.
 

[voice of interpreter] today I AM announcing a one-time, non-taxable payment of up to $600 that will be paid to Canadians with disabilities to help them pay their unexpected expenses during the crisis.
We are making a national workplace accessibility stream to help people find and keep a good job.
We are investing in projects across the country to help people with disabilities to overcome barriers in the workplace.
The numbers show that more Canadians returned to work last month, but that many, many people continue to face a reallytough time.
Roughly 1.2 million Canadians who were accessing the Canada emergency response benefit no longer need this help.
We must move quickly and carefully to get this done, to support the services Canadians rely on, and to get our communities back up and running.
Now we're making a substantial offer to keep supporting this work.
As you go back to work, we want to make sure you are protected wherever you are.
Here's what the premiers and I will work on for a safe restart agreement, which would cover thenext critical six to eight months.
We're talking about more personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines so they can focus onsaving lives, instead of worrying about their safety. They need so that everyone canadian is safe on the job, no matter where in the country theygo back to work.
Because when moms and dads get back to work, they shouldn't have to worry about how their kids are doing.
We're also talking about sick pay of up to 10 pay for workers who currently don't have benefits, the federal governmentwould provide the funds needed to make this happen.
and we're talking about support for cities and municipalities, so that when Canadians get back to work, they can count on the services they need like public transit and community services.
I'm looking forward to working with the premiers to make this happen.
For seniors and people who need extra support, for kids and for workers, this plan is for you.
With this safe restart agreement, we're proposing a standard of support to keep every canadian right across the country safe and healthy as we get our country back on their feet.
 

[voice of interpreter] we need a plan, a plan for all of Canada to restart the economy safely and efficiently, because by developing the right plan and having the right resources, we will be able to determine not only where we'll be this summer, but also this fall and this winter.
and now, we are offering to do even more to support that work.
This is money that will be used for personal protective equipment for workers including those working in the health carefield.
It will be money to pay for child care, to provide more funding to municipalities, to pay for sick leave, and to support the most vulnerable, such as seniors, who are living in long-term care facilities.
We are here to ensure the healthand safety of all Canadians right across the country as we restart our economy.
At this time, our greatest priority is to help people get through the crisis.
Half of those projects will be led by aboriginal people and theidea is not only to protect our environment, but to support local economies and create good jobs for Canadians.


[end of translation] we are living in unprecedented times, but this is not the first momentthat Canadians have been called to work together.
and not just because of the number of lives that were saved, but because of the number of people who helped save them.
If we keep working together, if we keep supporting each other, we will get through this.
