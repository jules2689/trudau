# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Videos and reports that have surfaced from across the country over the past few days are disturbing, and they bring to light the systemic realities facing far too many Canadians.
Later today I will be speaking with cabinet and to the RCMP commissioner.
We need to ensure that each of these individual cases is investigated properly, but we also need a larger reflection on changing the systems that do not do right by too many indigenous people and racialized Canadians.
We can't solve all of this overnight.
We need to make a change and we need to start today.
No matter who you are, COVID-19 will have had an impact on you in one way or another, because everyone has been affected by this pandemic.
and as we mark national accessibility week, we're reminded that some people have been hit especially hard, whether it's buying P.P.E. Or covering the cost of support workers, many Canadians with disabilities are facing unexpected bills that can be hard to pay.
To help cover these costs, todayi can announce that we're introducing a one-time, non-taxable payment of up to $600 for Canadians with disabilities.
We're not stopping there.
We're establishing a national workplace accessibility stream to help people with disabilitiesfind and keep a good job.
and we're funding five new projects across the country thatwill help people get supportive devices to overcome barriers in the workplace.
I know that Minister qualtrough will have more to say about all of this later today.
 

[voice of interpreter] today I AM announcing a one-time, non-taxable payment of up to $600 that will be paid to Canadians with disabilities to help them pay their unexpected expenses during the crisis.
We are making a national workplace accessibility stream to help people find and keep a good job.
We are investing in projects across the country to help people with disabilities to overcome barriers in the workplace.


[end of translation] earlier today we received the job reportfor may.
The numbers show that more Canadians returned to work last month, but that many, many people continue to face a reallytough time.
That tells us that we are movingforward, but we need to stay focused on getting people back on the job.
That's why we extended the wage subsidy over the coming months and have approved over 300, 000 applications to support millionsof jobs.
There's still a long time to go, but we're starting to see some progress.
Roughly 1.2 million Canadians who were accessing the Canada emergency response benefit no longer need this help.
This is encouraging news, but we're nowhere near done.
In order to move forward, we need a Canada-wide plan on safely and effectively restarting the economy.
Having the right approach and resources to back it up will determine where we are, not justin the coming weeks, but into the fall and winter.
Canadians have sacrificed too much over the past couple of months to lose the progress we've made.
As we restart, we must do so safely, with all the right precautions in place.
We know that the provinces and territories are under a lot of pressure right now and are facing real financial challengesbecause of this pandemic.
We want to help as much as possible.
We must move quickly and carefully to get this done, to support the services Canadians rely on, and to get our communities back up and running.
That's why our government has already taken action across the board on this restart.
Now we're making a substantial offer to keep supporting this work.
Yesterday, at our 12th first ministers' meeting since this crisis began, I brought our government's commitment to the table.
The federal government is ready to contribute $14 billion more for the things that all Canadians need.
As you go back to work, we want to make sure you are protected wherever you are.
Here's what the premiers and I will work on for a safe restart agreement, which would cover thenext critical six to eight months.
We're talking about more personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines so they can focus onsaving lives, instead of worrying about their safety.
We're talking about making sure that businesses have the P.P.E. They need so that everyone canadian is safe on the job, no matter where in the country theygo back to work.
We're talking about child care, so that every parent knows there's a safe place for their kids.
Because when moms and dads get back to work, they shouldn't have to worry about how their kids are doing.
We all know that there are too many seniors who have gotten sick from COVID-19. Along with our elders, there aremany people who are especially at risk if they get the virus.
So we want to provide immediate assistance so that the most vulnerable are protected.
We're also talking about sick pay of up to 10 pay for workers who currently don't have benefits, the federal governmentwould provide the funds needed to make this happen.
and we're talking about support for cities and municipalities, so that when Canadians get back to work, they can count on the services they need like public transit and community services.
I'm looking forward to working with the premiers to make this happen.
Provinces and territories are facing different realities, so flexibility will be important.
But here is the bottom line.
For seniors and people who need extra support, for kids and for workers, this plan is for you.
With this safe restart agreement, we're proposing a standard of support to keep every canadian right across the country safe and healthy as we get our country back on their feet.
 

[voice of interpreter] we need a plan, a plan for all of Canada to restart the economy safely and efficiently, because by developing the right plan and having the right resources, we will be able to determine not only where we'll be this summer, but also this fall and this winter.
Our government has already takensteps to that end.
and now, we are offering to do even more to support that work.
Yesterday, at our 12th first ministers' meeting since the beginning of the crisis, I made a proposal to My colleagues.
The federal government is prepared to provide $14 billion to restart the country safely and carefully.
This is money that will be used for personal protective equipment for workers including those working in the health carefield.
It will be money to pay for child care, to provide more funding to municipalities, to pay for sick leave, and to support the most vulnerable, such as seniors, who are living in long-term care facilities.
Of course the situation is different from one province to the other.
Our plan will reflect that, but this is the important part.
We are here to ensure the healthand safety of all Canadians right across the country as we restart our economy.
At this time, our greatest priority is to help people get through the crisis.
We are also thinking of what could happen not only in the coming months, but in the comingyears and decades.
The global environment day reminds us that we cannot build a better future if we don't havea plan to fight climate change.
Our government has taken ambitious commitments in that area, and today we are followingup on that.
We are announcing 16 new initiatives on nature conservation across the country.
Half of those projects will be led by aboriginal people and theidea is not only to protect our environment, but to support local economies and create good jobs for Canadians.


[end of translation] we are living in unprecedented times, but this is not the first momentthat Canadians have been called to work together.
This weekend, as we mark the anniversary of d-day, we remember all those who fought and died defending the values that we hold dear.
Like the brave men and women of the canadian armed forces today, our veterans served with courageand selflessness, and they served together.
Just as we stand here this morning because of their sacrifice, canadian troops stoodon juno beach because of those who came before them, because ofthe allied forces who had this same week four years earlier completed the rescue of over 300, 000 soldiers trapped on the beaches of dunkirk.
It was a remarkable operation.
and not just because of the number of lives that were saved, but because of the number of people who helped save them.
Hundreds of everyday men and women gave their boats to rescuetheir fellow citizens.
They would have never succeeded alone, but together they changedthe course of history.
and 80 years later, as we face our own fight, their stories stand as a reminder to us all.
Right now, we each have a role to play.
As a business owner, using the wage subsidy to keep your employees on the payroll.
As a young person helping your community through a Canada summer jobs placement.
Or even just by staying home when you can and following physical distancing when you're out.
No matter what you're doing to help, thank you.
If we keep working together, if we keep supporting each other, we will get through this.
Merci.
