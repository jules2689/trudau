### Summary:


For many small business owners and the workers being able to re-open is welcomed news.
That's why we brought in new, targeted support to get businesses going again.
Use the Canada emergency wage six did -- subsidy to rehire your workers, access alone through the emergency business account to adapt to new realities and contact your redevelopment agency where we've boosted funding if you don't qualify for other supports.
Thousands of business owners have already navigated the process and are getting the help they need. You'll find a section that lays out all of the programmes based on what your need is, from rehiring staff, to accessing credit.
Your business matters, to your employees and to our country.
We're creatinging the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance programme.
This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords so that they can reduce by 75% the rent for small business tenants that have lost the majority of their revenue because of COVID-19.
We're asking that landlords absorb 25% and tenants pay the rest with the support of programmes like the ceba.
For larger retailers who are also working on a new support and will have more details to share soon.




Whether you work at the restaurant around the corner or at an office downtown, your job is how you support yourself and your family.
In addition to our support for small businesses, we've also brought in help for companies of every size.
Last week, we launched the large employer emergency financing facility to provide bridge loans for the country's largest employers.
These loans will be delivered through the Canada development investment corporation in cooperation with innovation, science and economic development Canada and the department of finance.
Loans will be designed with a clear goal -- protecting jobs and helping our economy rebound.
Businesses can go online to cdev.
We are making loans available so that they can weather this storm and continue to employ millions of hard-working Canadians.
I want to end this morning by reminding parents that when you receive your Canada child benefit payment today, it will include an extra $300 per child.
