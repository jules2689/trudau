Star 1 for questions.




**Reporter**:

Bonjour, Mr. Trudeau.



**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Monday, we should be seeing the house re-open.
I'm not sure that's what you want.
That's what the conservatives want.
and you've seem to have lost your last ally, the NDP Now the bloc quÉbÉcois is also asking for specific things.
Will you give them this so that parliament can return normally? and what I'm talking about are changes to certain programmes and help for small businesses.
I'd just like to correct you, lena.
We definitely want to continue to defend our democratic institutions and to ensure that our parliament is working.
That is very important, not in spite of this crisis, but because of this crisis.
We need to have a parliament that works.
and for a number of weeks now, we have been getting together three times a week, twice virtually and once in person to allow members of parliament right across the country to ask their questions, to make a contribution and since the beginning of this crisis, those contributions from all the different parties have helped us to shape the support correctly to help millions and millions of Canadians.
So, yes, we definitely want the work of parliament to continue in the house of commons.
and right now there are discussions happening between the parties as to what the best way to do that would be. Given COVID-19. and those conversations are continuing.
But I can point out to you that all parties, including the liberal party, want us to have an opportunity to ensure that parliament is working properly.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think the important thing that we have seen over these past weeks that our parliament continues to function.
We've been meeting three times a week, twice virtually, once in person, to ensure that M.P.s across the country can be able to share the concerns of their constituents, ask questions of the government and its programmes and highlight solutions that will help Canadians as we move forward.
and from the begining, we've had tremendous input from all parties that have helped us make sure we're getting it right, to help millions of Canadians right across the country in this moment of crisis.
We want to make sure that we are functioning as an effective parliament during this time.
Not in spite of the crisis, but because of the crisis.
and that is why we're working right now with other parties in the house to try and figure out what the best way for us to move forward, to continue our democratic processes, to continue to have a strong, functioning parliament and democracy while at the same time ensuring that we're keeping everyone safe.



**Interpreter**:

Follow-up? lena, follow-up? Ok.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Now for small businesses, are you prepared to do more? I'm sorry, you were cut off at the beginning, Lena.
Could you repeat your question? sorry.
Yeah.
It's not working so well today.
I was saying the bloc quÉbÉcois is asking for specific things that you make changes to the emergency response benefit and more help for small businesses.
Now you said you would be doing something, but it hasn't happened.
So will you exceed to the requests being made by the bloc quÉbÉcois? well, we're continuing to show a lot of flexibility about the emergency benefit.
We know we need to help more Canadians and that is what we're doing, by working with the other parties.
and with Canadians.
With respect to fixed costs, the biggest one is business's rent.
and the announcement we're making today regarding the commercial rent assistance programme for small businesses will help a great many of them out there.
But we're continuing our discussions with all the political parties to have a functioning parliament.

Next question, aptn.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Hi. Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.
Sorry.
I'm having a problem with My phone here.
So, with provinces and economies opening up, first nations communities are remaining closed.
Now do you support these extra measures, even though they create tensions with nearby jurisdictions?



Prime Minister Trudeau's from the very beginning, our focus has been on keeping Canadians safe.
and with particular emphasis on people who are more vulnerable and we've seen that, because of challenges around health delivery, existing challenges and inequalities, indigenous community across the country are at a greater vulnerability to COVID-19 than others.
That is why we put in place measures early on to help these communities protect themselves and be supported in this pandemic time.
We know that, as economies start to re-open, as activity picks up across the country, we're going to have to make and local jurisdictions will have to make very careful decisions about how and where to re-open and we need to make sure that every step of the way people are working with all local stakeholders, including and specifically indigenous communities and leadership to ensure that we're not bringing in greater risks.
As much as we want the economy to re-open and things to get back to normal, we need to put the safety and security of all Canadians at the forefront of everything we do.



a follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
As a follow-up on a different note, this pertains more to federal than provincial prisons.
But in terms of early release programmes getting inmates with history of respiratory illnesses out of jail, now with the relaxing of restrictions, is that not a priority anymore and will -- I was wondering will Minister blair bl at the committee update today or when will he be there?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we've continued to look very closely at how we can ensure that federal institution like our correctional facilities are kept safe.
We are looking at various measures and have brought in a number of measures to keep both inmates and staff at those facilities safe.
We continue to adjust as time goes on and as things become more necessary or less necessary, we will stay active on a daily basis.



Thank youful next question.

Next question.
Kristy kirkup with "globe and mail". line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
You've addressed the issue of increased economic activity today.
Spain has made the mandatory wearing of masks, except for children.
is the mandatory wearing of masks being considered by Canada's committee of chief public health officers from across the country?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I know public health authorities are continuely looking at the research and the best way for Canadians to protect themselves.
I believe they will have further recommendations on masks in the coming hours.
Reality is the best thing for people to do is to remain socially distanced.
To keep two metres apart, to stay at home wherever possible, to wash your hands regularly and frequently.
But in situations where you cannot physically distance to two metres, you know, people are encouraged to wear masks and I will allow public health authorities to make that announcement a little later today.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

I believe that we all know that the best way to protect our self is to keep two metre's distance from others and to remain at home as much as possible.
But in situations where we cannot do that and we cannot keep our two metres' distance from others, it can be helpful to wear a mask.
The public health agency of Canada will be making an announcement in the coming hours on this matter.



Just a follow-up, quick.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
Just a quick follow-up, Prime Minister.
You've been seen wearing a mask, including in your office, for example.
Can you just paint a picture for Canadians about your personal approach to mask wearing.
When are you wearing a mask, how are you wearing a mask?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Obviously everyone's situation will be different and we always need to pay attention to public health authorities.
When it is possible for me to keep two metre's distance from people, that is what I prefer to do. In situations where I'm either walking through the halls of parliament, and going to My office and coming in proximity to people, I've chosen to start wearing a mask.
I will be wearing a mask as I go into parliament this afternoon.
For our in-person sitting.
Once I AM at My desk in parliament and two metres separate from everyone else, I will take off My mask so I can engage in parliamentary discourse.
But as soon as I leave My seat and walk past people and walk through potentially busier hallways, I will be wearing a mask.
That is My personal choices that is aligned with what public health is recommending.
I think we all need to adjust to what works in our circumstances and keep safety at the forefront of what we're doing.




**Interpreter**:

I think every person will make his or her own decision about their behaviour while at the same time following public health advice, we hope.
But in My case, when I move through parliamentary buildings and I will be going to parliament later for in-person session, when I'm walking down the hallways or when I go into the house of commons, I will be wearing a mask.
When I get to My seat, because there will be two metres' distance between me and My colleagues, I will take it off in order to take part in question period and upon leaving I'm going to put it back on again.
I do that when I'm moving around because it's not always that easy to keep two metres' distance from others and in such cases, I want to wear a mask.
But I'm inviting Canadians to reflect on how they can protect themselves and protect others while following public health advice.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to come back to parliamentary work.
It's been six weeks now -- more than six weeks that parliament has been suspended.
But we are also talking about six weeks of virtual sessions.
Now the bloc is talk about coming back sooner in order to make up for lost time.
Now do you think it's absolutely necessaries to make up for the lost time? well, I think those are things that we're all thinking about and will be discussing with the other parties.
Of course, we had an election platform on which we were elected and we would like to deliver on that platform.
At the same time, we know that COVID-19 has resulted in profound changes in the way the country is working in 2020.
So, there will be adjustments made.
and when it comes to parliament, whether it's for next month or the month to come, we are now in discussion with the other parties and I think it's important that we continue to sit for a number of weeks now we've been sitting three times a week, virtually and in person.
and that has been extremely important.
and we need to continue to allow members of parliaments to do their job.
Follow-up? I'd like to ask for a clarification.
I understand that there are discussions under way, but you personally, do you believe that the lost time has to be recovered this summer or do you think it still won't be time to do that because of the cry -- crisis? what are your personal views as to the next possible scenario? well, that will really depend on our discussions with the other pears and -- parties and how well we can move forward with pieces of legislation in the coming months.
Which bills will need to be introduced in the coming months and so forth.
I would like to be more clear.
But the fact is that the situation changes from week-to-week and it is possible that we will have to meet more frequently as a parliament so that we can do what needs to be done.
and ensure that all Canadians are safe and healthy.
With respect to the house of commons, now there is one request that is being made and that is with-regarding the need for an economic date.
The bloc is asking for that to happen.
In June.
Are you prepared to negotiate on that? and in terms of a hybrid parliament, now whether some people sitting virtually and others in person.
What do you think about that? well, I think it is an interesting idea.
We've seen that happen in the united kingdom.
and the house of commons has said that they could explore that option.
and I think it would be a good way of allowing parliament to sit both in person and also allow others in the regions to participate virtually so that their constituents are being represented in the house of commons.
So it is an interesting idea and the discussions are continuing.
With respect to an economic update, we have always been transparent about our investments and about what we're doing now.
Certainly things change every single week in terms of our economy and we will certainly want to share our plans for the economy until the coming months.
But, of course, we are working every single day to have a clear idea of what could happen.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think there is a lot of interest in a hybrid parliament model where some people will be there in person, where others will call in via video conferencing screens.
There are ways of making it work and ensuring that M.P.s from every corner of the country get to participate and make sure their citizens are reflected in the debates that go on in parliament and not just those who live near the national capital region.
Obviously these are discussions that continue but there are models that are effective out there that we should look at adapting for canadian use.
In regards to where our economy is going, our government has been open and a transparent about all the various measures we're putting forward.
It is till -- still very difficult to predict where our economy might be six months from now or three months from now.
We'll continue to work on sharing with Canadians a picture of what the future could look like.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Now on Twitter, president trump is talk about an in-person g-7 meeting.
Would you be prepared to attend? first of all, it is important to point out the importance of the g467 and the importance of meeting with other countries in order to fight this virus and talk about the economic recovery globally.
So that is very important.
We need to have a meeting and we already had a virtual meeting a few weeks ago.
and it's important that we have another one in one way or another in June.
With respect to the proposal of an in-person meeting, we will be looking at what the americans proposing.
-- Americans are proposing.
We'll look at what the conditions might be, what the health protocols would be. But this is an interesting idea.
But I think we need a lot more details before we can make a decision.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think it is extremely important that we continue to have leader-level summits.
We had a g-7 leaders virtual meet ago few weeks ago where we talked about this important situation we're in and we're going to need to keep talk about not just how we get through this COVID-19 pandemic, but how we restore the global economy to its right.
-- right.
-- right.
Rightful activities.
We need to keep meeting as leaders, whether that's in person, we'll certainly take a look at what the United States is proposing as host of the g-7 to see what kind of measures will be in place to keep people safe, what kind of recommendations the experts are giving in terms of how that might function.
There are lots of discussions to come.
But we look forward to having those discussions with the american hosts.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Tom parry, CBC.
You're asking landlords to take part in this programme that you are bringing in. We've heard reports of some landlords who aren't taking part, refusing to take part.
Doug ford was very forceful on this yesterday.
Are you having conversations with the premiers about putting more pressure on land lords to try to get them to take part in this programme?



Prime Minister Trudeau's I think we all understand that this is a crisis that is hitting really hard on businesses right across the country.
and we know that if our economy is to come back, we need a large number of those businesses to hold on and to make it through this pandemickful that is why we are providing commercial rent assistance to landlords and tenants and we really hope they will take us up on it. We know that if many businesses aren't able to make ends meet and do go under at this point, it will be slower to pick up the economy and that will be bad for Canadians and also be bad for landlords.
It will also be bad for building owners who will see a slower regaining of economic activity and, indeed, with many people discovering that we can work from home to a much greater degree.
There may be a lot of vacancies in commercial buildings over the coming months and years.
Who knows exactly what the post-pandemic world will look like exactly.
and that is why making sure we're supporting the businesses we have now to be able to stay in their spaces as we grow -- as we slowly restore our economy is going to be important and we certainly expect landlords to be part of this solution.
 trep



**Interpreter**:

We know that it is very important to ensure that the economy is make a strong recovery.
There are too many business, too many people out there who have lost their business because they don't have the necessary support.
To get through this crisis.
and if that happens, the recovery will be much slower and harm the entire economy.
and it could also really harm land lords who own buildings.
So, it is our hope that building owners, landlords, will take advantage of these measures to help their tenants get through this crisis.
So that we can recover strongly as an economy.
In a crisis like this, we have to be there for each other and that is what I expect of landlords.



**Reporter**:

Police say they've made 2, 000 home visits for people coming back into Canada, making sure that they're complying with the self-isolation rules.
You were talking about yesterday bringing in more measures when nonessential travel is allowed.
Other countries have brought in monitoring devices.
is that something you'd look at or other options first? what wr* -- where do you stand on that?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think we know that a key part in re-opening and keeping our economy going and controlling future spreads of COVID-19 will involve being very, very careful that we're not importing new cases.
Even as our economies open up, even as border restrictions are potentially loosened down the road.
We want to ensure that new cases aren't arriving and spreading through the general population.
We're in discussions to ensure that we do have the capacities to do that as we look at economic re-opening.
Those conversations are ongoing.



**Reporter**:

You spoke a moment ago about rent relief for landlords.
Why not give that relief directly to the tenants? why not just bypass the land lords if they're reluctant to start using it?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We know that the solution involves bringing new community and a groups together.
The landlords need to be a part of the solution on this.
We need them to understand that they do have a deep, vested interest in keeping their renters in those spaces, that if more businesses go under because of COVID-19, we're all going to be worse off.
and that is why this approach, in concert with the provinces, is going to be the right approach to do it and we implore and expect landlords and building owners to understand that we all are in this together.
We need to be there for each other and this program is there to help them and to help small businesses.



and as provinces re-open and parents are expected to go back to work, child care is an issue.
I know that is a provincial matter.
But I'm wondering what discussions you might be having with provinces in terms of child care to help out those parents.
and are you concerned about the lack of child care in this country and what impact that may have in terms of re-opening the economy?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As a party, we've long been concerned about the lack of child care spaces across this country.
We know it's a challenge in the best of times for families to find that balance between care for their kids and the jobs they need to support their families.
That's why, when woe formed government in 2015, we moved forward with historic investments in child care agreements with the provinces to increase the accessibility of child care.
In our last platform, getting re elected, we made more commitment on child care, and working with the provinces to invest in programmes that will help more parents and more families and grow our economies and our communities.
We need to continue to do that, particularly right now.
We will be there to work with the provinces as we re-open and respond to child care needs.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Molly Thomas, CTV national news.
While your government has flexed its fiscal fire power, as you call it, no government has unlimited money.
So, your government will ultimately choose who gets the lee ff money so how comfortable are you in this new economy choosing the winners and the losers?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

It's important to highlight with the new lee ff programme, the government is there as a lender of last resort.
Large businesses, unlike the small businesses that we've been very generous and direct to with the Canada emergency business account, large businesses have much greater access to credit on the international credit markets, through the big banks, and that is why we're encouraging them to make available the credit facilities that they have right now.
If they are in a situation where they cannot access that credit, they can turn to the government for funds through the lee ff programme.
But they are loans that come with conditions around governance, around paying proper share of taxes, around a plan for climate change.
These are the kinds of things that we expect as Canadians when our taxpayer dollars go towards supporting businesses.
So, we are there as a programme, but there are many conversation and discussions that are going to happen within companies as they look at the best way to weather this storm.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, switching gears a bit.
The united nations said today that Canada has an obligation to secure Turk enlts release and repatriation of a 5-year-old orphan girl in northeastern syria, especially now with COVID-19 posing an added threat.
She has family here in Canada.
What is your government going to do to get amira out of that overcrowd refugee camp?



Prime Minister Trudeau's we have been working on this file for many months now.
We know that it is an extremely difficult situation for the family.
We're making sure that we're going through the proper processes, but we also understand the importance of being that country that is consistently there to support people in difficulty around the world.
We're trying to do our part, even in difficult situations and I want to thank the extraordinary public servants who are working through this pandemic to help.
Merci.beaucoup.



**Operator**:

We will now open the telephone and floor toquestions.
We will start on the phone, as usual and over to you.
Merci.
Thank you.
and the next question is fromlina dibb.
Please go ahead.

**Question**:

Bonjour.
Good morning, Dr. Njoo, could you explain the difference, please, between what you'resaying now, recommending thatnonmedical masks be warn and what you were saying up until now about masks.
I don't quite understand thenuance.
Could you please explain it?



**Answer**:

Thank you for thequestion.
In fact, there isn't that much difference between what Dr. Tam and I have already said.
We are continuing our conversations with our provisional and territorial counterparts and with the science evolving, we're saying that it is a supplementarymeasure.
As we've said many times, medical grade masks must be reserved for healthcare workers, but for the general public, if we find ourselves in circumstances in which it's not possible to maintain two metres of distance from other people, it is an extra layer ofprotection.
and it depends on thecircumstances, too, however.
The epidemiology varies from one region to another.
Obviously if you're using public transportation in Montreal, that's a completely different situation from being in theyukon up north.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

My next one is foryou, Dr. Tam.
So what exactly has changed for you now to say we recommend? because you are saying that the mask does not protect the person that is wearing it. I AM assuming that this is still the case and what has changed for you now to go the extra step and just say this is a goodidea, this can be done and now we recommend that you do this.



So that's a specificrecommendation.
I think the previous language was more permissive.
So I think just to rewind Little bit, the chief medicalofficer's position from the start was that, of course, these masks protect others.
So if you're wearing it, you'reprotecting other people against your droplets.
So at the start, it was obviously someone who is sick, who is coughing or sneezing, ifthey're going to go out or have to go to a medical appointment, for example, they need to cover the cough and wear a facial covering or mask.
That is for the sick person.
So it's when we got more evidence about asymptomatic andpresymptomatic individuals and that although we don't fully understand their role intransmission, it is an added layer of protection, even for people who don't have symptoms to have to wear a mask to prevent transmission to others.
and even though the evidence space hasn't changed too much, and particularly as people have generally been staying at home and now that we're reopening or restarting a lot of theactivities, the chief medical officers melt that they can recommend this for people who cannot maintain that two-metredistance.
and more specifically, if, ofcourse, there's a virus --there's been a communitytransmission in yourjurisdiction and as Dr. Njoosaid, jurisdictions felt thatthey need to do that riskassessment because there's someprovince and territories thathaven't had communitytransmission and others who haveclearly Havel and continue to have community transmissionactivities.
So they will do their individualrisk assessments in tems of thevery specific recommendationslocally.
But I think from ourperspective, it is an addedlayer of probes.
Protection.
So if two people aregmasks, I'm protecting you andyou're protecting me. So I think as more people to goout in the community, you canimagine there will be morepeople on public transport ormaybe more people -- some of theretail stores are beginning toopen, for example, and you can'tpredict whether you can maintainthat two-metre distance, thenit's recommended that you wearthe nonmedical mask or facialcovering.



**Operator**:

The next question is from mike blanch from thecanadian press.
Please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

I guess this is question for Dr. Tam.
We've seen radical different approaches in the two largestprovinces, Ontario and Quebec, on reopening and especially when it comes to schooling and we heard what Doug ford saidyesterday.
How do you explain the differences in approach toreopening, easing the restrictions and these two highly afflicted in two ofcanada's largest provinces?



So at the federal level and working with the province andterritories, essentially, the chief medical officers, we have provided guidance and criteria, but obviously, the provinces want to retain their own ability to adjust their approaches even if the global context, I don'tknow that there's an absolute right pathway down this curve.
As I said, people have to do whatever they do cautionly and slowly using the best information they have and that if they were reopening or loosening measures, they need to have the best systems to detect whether that has lead to any increase in cases or clusters.
So I think whatever pathway down this curve, there is no one size fits all and there is a certain element of uncertainty, but if you do it more cautiously and monitor it and adjust as needed, that is the key principle.



**Operator**:

Follow-up.

---

**Question**:

Well, then, how do you square the differencesanyway? there are two similar provinces, similar sets of circumstances.
Does it surprise you from scientific point of view that two extremely different conclusions can be reached under these circumstances?



Well, I think as the localjurisdictions, I think the public health is also trying to take a holistic approach, not just balancing the effective public health measures, but looking at the negativeconsequences, as well.
You need to have some balance.
You need to bring back certain activities and certain measures, getting people outside, forinstance.
The outside is less risk because we know transmission generally occurs and generally transmission to large number of people occurs indoors but there may be good reason why things are being opened in order to support the community in their local context, as well.
It's a balance between the need to reduce a spread of disease compared to all of the other needs from a health, social and economic perspective.

---

**Question**:

Obviously the provisional authorities know more what's happening on the ground than Dr. Tam and myself and they know what's happening on the ground and so we can see in the province of Quebec thatwhat's happening on the island of Montreal and how they may be relaxing their measures, youknow, maybe in a slower faction based on the epidemiology ofwhat's happening, that's a primeexample.
That even within a province, there needs to be a careful look at what's happening locally to make the best decisions based on what they know in teams of theepidemiology.
Thank you.



**Operator**:

The next question.

---

**Question**:

My question is foryou, Dr. Tam.
I think I have an idea of the answer but I would like you toexplain.
Why is your recommendation to the nonsurgical masks, why is it only a recommendation and why are you not making it mandatorycanada-wide to wear a mask when we go outside? is it a question ofjurisdiction? is it a question of therewouldn't be enough masks to makeit mandatory? it is a question of rights andcan you explain why it remainsonly a recommendation?



The medical officers of health needs to look at their own particular context in terms of whether they have evidence of community transmission and some areas actually don't and have actually never had communitytransmission.
It's very different from, say, maybe comparing Montreal andtoronto to Yukon or the P.E.I. Might be different.
So they need that eight to makethose recommendations.
The public transportationsystems might be different, forexample and, so, they need theability to do that riskassessment and recommend it fromtheir perspective.
From the federal perspective andtransport Canada, of course, given the federal jurisdiction, did make the wearing ofnonmedical masks mandatory onthose conveyances.
So that is within the federaljurisdiction.



Maybe I would just add, the interest in terms of the use ofmon medical masks by the generalpublic, but one of the issueswe're also, obviously, with our counterparts and territories are looking at closely is the unintended consequences.
If people think wearing a ma skin public, they don't need to follow all of the other public health measures that we've been underlining so many times in guarding the physical distance of two metres, ET cetera.
So that's one of the things, ithink, we need to underline, that this is, quote, supplementary measure, people can use to protect themselves when it's different to maintain the physical distancing of too ometres.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

As a follow-up, Dr. Tam, so that as youmentioned previously, it wasalready suggested to wear anonmedical mask when we gooutside and now it'srecommended.
and in places like Quebec, forexample, it's been stronglyrecommended for a week alreadyand we see that people are notnecessarily wearing it outsideat the grocery store or in otherlocations or they can't socialdistance.
So what exactly can you do aspublic health officials to ensure that something actuallychanges on the ground? your language is changing, butpeople aren't wearing it more.



I can't speak to the local jurisdiction and they will adjust their approach as needed.
But I think from certain publicopinion, research, ET cetera, Canadians are wearing more mask sand they are more -- the social cultural shift is beginning tooccur.
So part of what public health is doing -- the concept is one, ithink, of reciprocal protection and so I think for Canadians, thinking of it as I'm protecting you and you're protecting me ISS very key concept.
We have to gain the trust off of the Canadian public and get their buy-in to do all of this.
and mandating is one measure, which some jurisdictions mighttake if they have to, but forthe most part, I think that theshift is occurring in thepopulation, as well, which ithink is great.



Thank you, doctor.
We'll turn to the room for aquestion.

---

**Question**:

I'm with the national post and thepan-canadian public healthcarenetwork, which you're chair of, wrote a report in 2016 calledthe blueprint for fedderratedsystem of public healthsurveillance.
It recommended the province andfeds work close together andsaid there were gaps in how theyshare data and differences inhow they collect data and I'mwondering what progress has beenmade in implementing that reportto a more aligned system betweenthe provinces and the federalgovernment.



Yes.
So I think data is extremelyimportant, obviously, to any outbreak and pandemic is to thisscale.
To from a regular outbreakperspective, we have verywell-run mechanisms.
a key concept is that we reactfast, information is shed.
But something of this scale andthe respiratory domain, that'sobviously some gaps, particularly reporting to thenational level that we do have to address.
Some of it is timeliness, butsome of the fields can not becompleted by the jurisdictionsat the home when we look at thecompletion rates.
So we are actively trying tovery hard to figure out, well, what is needed? is it more support at differentlevels? can the system be made moreefficient? because efficiency in the systemhelps our frontline publichealth workers, as well, busydoing certain things that theremay be system efficiencies.
Of course, data comes from anydifferent areas and thecomplexity of the landscape.
Some data has to come fromhospitals.
It has to come from labs andlocal public health units andso, I think it is absolutelyrecognised and also at the firstminister's level that this is anabsolutely another chance for usto improve on what we're doing.
But I think capitalling on thecapitalizing, we need to give itrthe next piece.

---

**Question**:

What were the barriers in bringing this datatogether? is it jurisdictional, that provinces don't want to ease upon their control of healthcare? do you think not having shared data has hindered our ability to respond to this pandemic?



So it is a fedderrated system and this is a local level-upsystem and we collaborate to getdata and that's always been theconstruct.
The most important thing is atthe local level, they have thedata they need to actuallyrespond to the identification ofcases and the follow-up ofcontacts which we all know isvery important and that's thekey.
There's reporting to thejurisdiction level that has to be -- that is under thejurisdiction of the province andterritories.
and from the province to thefederal level, as we at thefederal level don't do theday-to-day case management, thatthe data is needed and the datais useful to the localjurisdictions and they have beenactioning and they have beenproviding advice, public healthadvice on the local information.
But it is important to get thenational picture and to be ableto provide that to policymakers, as well.
So I think we have the basicinformation, but I think whatpeople needed and asking for nowis what we all this aggregation, more in-depth analysis.
We have things like age or sex, but there is a need to havefirst nation's innuit metis dataas well as ethnicity data, as well.
That's what we need to work on. Because if you're fine-tuningyour policies to supportvulnerable populations, that'simportant.
We do have data, for example toprovide measures or policies orprograms to those at risk whichis the seniors and those withunderlying medical conditions, et cetera.
So that data is available indriving the response indifferent jurisdictions andlong-term care, but it'simportant to take that nextstage so that we can furthersupport particularly vulnerablepopulations.



Thank you, next question, CTV.

**Question**:

Dr. Tam, understand more evidence of asymptomatic symptoms has influenced a massrecommendation, but did we drop the ball here? I mean, I think of smallercountries, the Czech republic, Vietnam have had mandatory masks in place for some time.
Do you regret this decision and could we have prevented the spread here?



I think the decision was taken to ask people to stay athome.
The quarantine periods, the isolation of periods and quarantining of contact has been the mainstay.
So we have effectively stopped and decelerated.
So when I say the tried and true public health measures, those are the identification casescontacts, isolation quarantine, hand washing and physical distancing has worked.
So this is an added layer on top of that and I do think that Otis important as we begin to reopen -- now, people no longer are staying at home.
More people will be going outside and public transit maybe more crowded as a result.
This will help us reopen and add another layer to that, how do you go out safely message, ithink.
But the message the canadiansmust remain all of those previous measures with this as an added layer of protection and so then we will still have to collect some information.
The kind of data to show the efficacy on top of everything else might actually be the centre because multiple things are happening, but it would be interesting to look in thecanadian context what this has produced and as people adopt this measure no widely.

**Question**:

So no regrets? we need to flexibly, you know, change our measures as we get more information, but as I'vejust said, it's always been if you were infectious, and that was at the beginning when we thought the majority hadsymptoms, you do put a face covering on to preventtransmission.
If you're even at home looking after a sick person, but themask.
So I think adding on this lay eras we learn more was the appropriate thing to do. and I think we need to focus on the here and now.
Maybe in all future respiratory outbreaks this will be the actual norm to do and so, ithink, we need to sort of look forward to what might be the approach in Canada goingforward.

**Question**:

So you said on average we're testing about28, 000 people a day.
a week is a half ago, I think it was 26, 000 on average and we'reup to a small goal to 60, 000 and what is the hold-up here?



So 60, 000 is the capacity that is already there for public health labs.
So your question is, why are we only doing 28 or maybe higher? some days it is higher and this is a bit of an average.
and so this is something that the highest levels ofgovernments, a lot of this, in talking with the chief medical officer in British Columbia, they said their level of infection has come down andthere's no one with much in the way of a respiratory illness.
They will, of course --everybody is widen their community testing to include even mild symptoms and sometimes people are not actually showing up and so it depends, I think, on the access, the uptake of the testing on the ground.
Not necessarily because theydon't have the capacity, but also because of what the local medical officers feel to be inline with where they are in theepidemic.
Having said that, looking atabsolutely, how do we appropriately increase thetesting? for example, you have seen in certain provinces, they'relooking at the vulnerablesettings, the long-term carelooking at testing and people inthat setting, whether they'resymptomatic or not and thepeople who work there.
So there's systematic pilots orsurveillance done injurisdictions and we'll sharethat information across thecountry to see if people canlearn from each other as to whatis the appropriate area forincreasing testing.
So all of that is at play.
The key is you need to have asensitive enough system todetect any resurgence of casesand clamp down on the contextand that is the fundamentalprinciple.

Next question,<I> </I>toronto star .

**Question**:

Dr. Tam, that leads to what I was going to ask you about.
Specifically, since you talked on so many topics about the need to respect jurisdictions.
I'm curious, what exactly are the elements that the federal level has proposed as a national framework on testing and contact tracing that the prime minister said was tabled last week toprovinces?



So I think all province and territories know that some of the three fundamental aspects --so the criteria and the indicators are laid down in the recommendations or the guidance of the special advisorycommittee, which is the public health foundation for whichtesting, contact tracing and then isolation and quarantine is the fundamental public heal thunder pinning or principle for this next phase.
and so, everybody knows that that is absolutely critical.
Everybody knows that we have to increase capacity to detect any resurgence is build a capacity towards an increase if we're to see that in the fall.
We hope that we can clamp down on any sparks and torontos.
Intnand the suppression to sparks iskey.
I think the federal government'skey role, I think, the Prime Minister has offered resources, support to the provinces as needed to ramp up the capacity.
We are supporting, of course, swabs, reagents, if there's need for any other furthersupport, as well.
and looking at what else the provinces need.
We provide guidance, of course, and these are updated asappropriate.
So to look at what population needs to be tested over time, as well.

**Question**:

The national framework on testing proposed, sit overstating the case to say framework on how testing should go forward? you came up with guidelines that you came up with weeks ago.
is there something new on the table or no?



So I think that speaks to the higher level commitment that ISS wider strategy.
That is not just, of course, technical guidance but looking at supplies and other resource sand support that would berequired.
But fundamentally, we've always had a strategy for laboratorytesting, which is founded on public health guidance and that changes over time.
So at the beginning, it was started more at travelers because that's where the epidemiology was at. The peak of the epidemic didn'tpeople are asked to stay at home if they have mild symptoms.
So at that stage, the testing approach and strategy is focused on the sickest people and areas of outbreaks like long-term careand healthcare workers.
As we begin to get this firstwave under control and into thisrecovery, reopening phase, it'sabout widen, then, that testing, for example, to people with mildsymptoms who would never sort ofin the previous phase wasnecessary tested.
Now we're expanding the testingto particularly symptomatic butwith mild symptoms, as well as avery low threshold for testingder certain high-risksettings, whether it's long-termcare, shelters, indigenouspopulations at higher risk ofthe severe impacts.
and so, this is fundamental to the strategy.
and, also, then, how do we widensurveillance and havingsurveillance systems which arebuilt upon respiratory illnesssurveillance systems? maybe there are othersurveillance approaches that we can take.
We call those pilots orsurveillance activities, whichcan take into account, forexample, testing of asymptomaticpeople.
So that is the actual approachwhich varies and will beadaptive and I think an adaptivestrategy, which is now movinginto the next phase.
At the same time as doing that, ramping up our capacity in everysingle channel that we can.
So the other aspect of thestrategy is that right now, there are three modalities we'relooking at. One, the existing ramping up ofthe laboratory base pcr testingand that is the key to testingwhether you have the infectionnow.
Widening that from the lab baseto point of care, so that's apart of the strategy, gettingpoint of care tests, gettingsupplies and particularly tocover the rural and more remoteareas.
That is still awork-in-progress.
We're getting gene express, COVID-19 2 express kits.
You have seen in la loche, Nunavut and others having thesesupplies.
So point of care particularly tocover those areas are veryimportant.
Thirdly, you've header theimmunity task force, sirologywill become the third componentof the testing strategy.
One, the primary key aspect ofthat, as you probably alreadyher is to conduct the surveys touncover how much of thepopulation -- what is theprevalence and how much of thepopulation has been infected.
That's important for policydecisions, not just now but as we get a vaccine, for example, in the future to know what thepopulation immunity is and wherewe might be going withvaccination strategies.
