# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

and because of those actions and those choices, in many parts of the country, we're getting this virus under control.
It doesn't mean we can let down our guard.
But what our progress does mean is that where it's safe to do so, we can gradually and a carefully restart some of our activities.
For many small business owners and the workers being able to re-open is welcomed news.
Of course, this is not without its challenges.
People need help getting back on their feet.
That's why we brought in new, targeted support to get businesses going again.
Use the Canada emergency wage six did -- subsidy to rehire your workers, access alone through the emergency business account to adapt to new realities and contact your redevelopment agency where we've boosted funding if you don't qualify for other supports.
Thousands of business owners have already navigated the process and are getting the help they need.
and if you're not one of them yet, we're making it simpler to find out what's available.
Go to the COVID-19 page at Canada.
Ca. You'll find a section that lays out all of the programmes based on what your need is, from rehiring staff, to accessing credit.
Your business matters, to your employees and to our country.
In fact, it matters to our whole economy.
So a concern for you is a concern for us, too.
and that brings me to the question of your rent.
Paying rent on your space might be a problem right now.
We hear that so we're taking action.
We're creatinging the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance programme.
This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords so that they can reduce by 75% the rent for small business tenants that have lost the majority of their revenue because of COVID-19. If you are a landlord and you and your tenant are eligible, please apply.
Go to cmhc.
Ca to get the details on what information you'll need when the application portal opens, starting may 25. Once this launches, you'll receive your relief quickly.
Our government, along with the provinces and territories will cover 50% of the rent.
We're asking that landlords absorb 25% and tenants pay the rest with the support of programmes like the ceba.
For larger retailers who are also working on a new support and will have more details to share soon.
These are challenging times.
But together, we can protect jobs and make sure that our economy bounces back.
and that will be good for everyone.




**Interpreter**:

We are in the process of introducing the Canada emergency commercial rents assistance programme.
As part of this programme, landlords will be able to receive a forgivable loan to reduce by 75% the rent paid by small business tenants and if they have lost the majority of their revenues.
Go to the site of the Canada mortgage and housing corporation to see what you need to apply to the programme once the portal launches on may 25. You will receive the support you need soon afterwards.
Our government, along with the provinces and territories, will be covering 50% of the rent.
We are asking landlords to cover 25% and tenants will have to pay the rest through programmes such as the emergency business account.
For larger retailers, we are in the process of developing new support measures and will have additional details on that very soon.
Together, we can protect jobs and take action to ensure that our economy makes a strong recovery.
and that is good for everyone.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Whether you work at the restaurant around the corner or at an office downtown, your job is how you support yourself and your family.
and no matter what you do, no matter how many other people your workplace employs, we need to protect that.
In addition to our support for small businesses, we've also brought in help for companies of every size.
Last week, we launched the large employer emergency financing facility to provide bridge loans for the country's largest employers.
As of today, applications for this financing are open.
These loans will be delivered through the Canada development investment corporation in cooperation with innovation, science and economic development Canada and the department of finance.
Our priority is that this programme be fair and effective.
Loans will be designed with a clear goal -- protecting jobs and helping our economy rebound.
Businesses can go online to cdev.
GCC.
Ca for more information on the application process.
I want to be clear -- we are not offering companies a bailout.
We are making loans available so that they can weather this storm and continue to employ millions of hard-working Canadians.




**Interpreter**:

Starting today, businesses can apply to receive funding through the large employer emergency financing facility.
For more information on the application process, businesses are invited to go online and consult the cdev.
GCC.
Ca website.
These loans will be granted through the investment development corporation of Canada in cooperation with innovation, science and economic development Canada and the department of finance.
Our priority will be to ensure that the programme is fair and effective.
So, we have set ourselves a very specific goal -- protecting jobs and helping the economy to rebound quickly.
But I want to be clear.
This is not a blank cheque for businesses.
We are granting loans so that they can get through the crisis and continue to employ millions of Canadian right across the country.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

No matter who you are or where you live, we're here to support you.
I want to end this morning by reminding parents that when you receive your Canada child benefit payment today, it will include an extra $300 per child.
This is money to help you through this very tough time.




**Interpreter**:

Wherever you are or wherever you live, we are there for you.
When you receive your Canada child benefit today, you will be receiving $300 more per child.
This is money to help your family get through this difficult period.
and I'd just like to say a few words to parents.
It's not easy raising children these days.
But you're all doing a great job.
Despite all the challenges out there and the problems we are facing together as a society.
Our parents are doing a wonderful job every single day.
So, continue your great work and we will be there to support you.
Together we will get through this.
Thank you.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll now go to the phone for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?



I'm great, thank you.



**Rosemary**:

I will admit My pro-winnipeg bias by getting you on today, given I'm from there and I do like going to the forks when I'm back in town.
What struck me about the story that I read on our website was your approach to rent on a day when this commercial rent programme has opened up. Can you give me a sense of what you decided to do for the various stalls and businesses inside the forks?



Yeah.
So when, you know , the pandemic hit and we were looking at what was going to potentially ham over the months or coming months, we made a decision to not charge our tenants rent.
and it wasn't a decision that we came to lightly.
But we are also an organization that has additional revenue sources.
So it was something that we were able to do for our tenants the.
and our thought process was that we wanted them to be able to come back.
We wanted them to have the best chance of being around once this pandemic was over.



**Rosemary**:

Your additional revenue sources come from where? from government funding? how are you able to make that work?



No, we're financially self-sufficient revenue-based organization.
We are the stewards of the forks site, which is 50 acres.
We own and operate the forks market, but we don't own and operate the rest of the buildings on the site and that includes the canadian museum for human rights.
There's a hotel here, a children's museum, a theater for young people.
We also own and operate all of the parking on the site as well and they have land leases in the rest of downtown.
While we're financially self-sufficient, we have additional source of revenue and that also didn't mean that we weren't, you know, affected in terms of our own teams.
We laid off about 90% of our staff.



**Marcy**:

Were you able to qualify for the wage subsidy programme?



We weren't able to qualify because of the way that we are structured.



**Marcy**:

Ok. So, you've taken this personal hit on how the company works, the company that runs the forks.
Meanwhile, what is the state of the companies inside the organization? the tenants.



Well I've spoken to every single one of them over the last couple of weeks and we've given them the option as opening right now as restrictions ease in Manitoba.
Our food vendors can open and we just can't have seating inside.
So we have a beautiful 50 acres outside that you can take your food out to and we were able to open our outside bar as well.
So, so far so good.
We opened on Friday.
and slowly they're starting to come back and people are starting to come back.
Le



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
You are ahead of the game in terms of Ontario and other places in the country.
That is for sure.
What are you going to do going forward for rent? you didn't force them to pay right now.
But at some point, they have to start paying again.
How are you approaching that?



Right.
We have a slightly different relationship with our tenants anyways, than probably most other landlords.
We're more participatory than we are probably than other places.
We take percentage rents so when there is a sale, then we will make something off that sale and that helps us run the building.
So that's what we're looking at for now.
and at some point, when it is required that everybody open, we'll be returning to more normal rents.



**Rosemary**:

When you hear the Prime Minister today announcing this portal will finally be open, where landlords have to take on some of the rent and tenants do and the governments will back some of it, but only starting now, what do you make of that programme? I don't know if it would have helped in your case, if you would have qualified.
Does it make sense for landlords, sdmaoung-- do you think?



You know, I can't speak on behalf of other landlords and because we have additional revenue sources, we were able to make this decision.
So, you know, we're all in unchartered territory here.
Maybe it would have helped us and there are other tenants on the site.
But I can't say for sure.



**Rosemary**:

So, just give me -- are there people around? are you seeing people? are people coming to the forks?



Yeah! yeah.
I mean, it was a beautiful weekend here.
It was 28° over the weekend.
and I was may long.
You know, normally on a may long weekend, we have 30, 000 people through the and enter the doors of forks market.
I would say we had over the entire weekend about 2, 000.
So, people are definitely -- you know, they're coming to enjoy the public space, which is what we're normally known for and now they can grab a hot dog and a beer at the same time.



**Rosemary**:

I wanted to get you on because I found it to be a creative solution at a time when people were looking for different kinds of ways to keep going.
Thank you so much for making the time today.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

That's Claire McKay, the vice president of corporate and community services with the forks, north portage partnership in Winnipeg.
All right.
Over the weekend, you may have heard the Prime Minister announce that the first clinical trials will begin on a potential vaccine here in this country.
Researchers at dalhousie university will conduct that first trial and Dr. Joanne Langley is a vaccine investigator with the Canadian centre for vaccinology and she joins me from Halifax.
Good to see you.



Hi, rosy-, thank you for having me on.



**Rosemary**:

That is a cool title -- vaccine investigator, I must say.
[laughter]tell me what you and your colleagues have managed to do so far.



Well, we do vaccine evaluation research here at the Canadian centre of vaccinology and we're going to explore sites across Canada as part of the Canadian immunization research network and this is part of Canada's preparedness for emerging infectious diseases and so we're going to be doing phase one starting with this particular vaccine as soon as the vaccine is here and we have our research ethics and we have protocol and lots of people who heard the Prime Minister's announcement who are contacting us and would like to participate.



**Rosemary**:

Oh, really?



We have research nurses here.
We have a whole complement of staff who will greet participants and take them through this trial in a very safe and careful way.



**Rosemary**:

Interesting.
So, do you have any sense of numbers of how many people put up their hand and said I'm willing to try this out to see if it works?



Hundreds so far.



**Rosemary**:

Wow.



That have just contacted us. We don't have an a official notice on the website because we don't haves research ethics approval but I'm sure there will be lots.
We will see a vaccine trial for Canada's vector vaccine and we had thousands.
and we actually inquired with them about why they participate.
and the main reason is people want to see science advance and they also have this altruism about helping people in another part of the world in the case of Ebola, because Ebola illness wasn't here in Canada.



**Rosemary**:

Wow.
Yeah.
So, of course, you know, we've heard the Prime Minister talk about and others talk about how far away we are from a vaccine.
We know there are about 100 or so on the go in different stages around the world.
What is the sort of timeline for how this will work for our clinical trial here?



So, we anticipate that, if all goes well, we could start enrolling participants in the next couple of weeks.
Then this is the phase one trial so it is an early trial.
It goes shoely.
-- it goes slowly.
We look at safety data over seven days, 14 days and make sure all the participants have maintained their good health and then proceed with the next step of the evaluation.
So, we're looking at different doses of vaccines and numbers of doses.
If people need one dose or two dose.
So I think at this time with the pandemic, things are very accelerated and the whole scientific community is more willing to expedite their review of data as it arises, to approve things, provided they're safe and effective.
We could being looking at a phase three trial where we will have thousands of people potentially in 2020, if all goes well.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
It ha able a real story of global partnership between scientists that has been quite remarkable.



Mm-hmm.



**Rosemary**:

If you were going to -- I don't know if you want to put some money on it, but how long are we from a vaccine, do you think, given that there is this sort of unprecedented collaboration around the world?



Mg hmm.
Well, at the point where you're in a phase three trial, you are enrolling thousands.
Tense of thousands and even up to 100, 000.
So if the emerging data from that study was re-assuring, then you could actually enroll people in a rather large phase four trial where it would be open to the general public.
But you would still be doing monitoring to look for adverse events that are rare and will not be identified until you've enrolled a million people or so. At that point, it would be available to a large percentage of the population.
With the pandemic 2009 vaccine, the government authorized a vaccine in a special way with an a interim order so it wasn't this slow process of, you know, 10 to 15 years to approve a vaccine.
So, that kind of -- that regulatory pathway might also be available for this vaccine.
Given the urgent health need.



**Rosemary**:

Are you, doctor, opt mystic? -- optimistic? maybe you need to be in your job, but are you opt mystic that we'll find a solution to this?



I AM optimistic.
There are a lot of different vaccines being investigated, different kinds of mechanisms of engaging in the immune system, different ways of presenting the antigen and, you know, over 100 different types of products are in development and we need all of those trials because sometimes things are just surprising when they get into humans, unexpected things happen.
It doesn't work or there is a side effect or painful at the injection site.
I'm comfort that scientists will be able to figure out a few vaccines that will be efficacious.



**Rosemary**:

I know you worked in this field for quite some time.
As you said you worked on the Ebola vaccine.
I know you worked on the pandemic plan for this country.
Did you just expect that this would happen one day or is this all a bit surprising to you as it is to the rest of us?



It's certainly some kind of pandemic that was anticipated.
Probably the scope of this with the amount of societital implications.
We probably didn't expect it to be -- to have this type of broad effect on our entire population.
But it was on the list of things that could happen.
The reality of it is something.



**Rosemary**:

That's quite right.
Doctor, thank you for making the time.
I know you're very busy and I don't want to take away from the work that you are doing and our thanks as well for doing that work.
It's so important.
Thank you so much.



My pleasure.
Thank you so much.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
That is Dr. S Joanne Langley with the Canadian centre for vaccinology and she is in Halifax today.
We'll take a short break now.
On the other side, we'll hear from public health officials.
Remember, we are expecting some sort of news on mask wearing in this country as well as the COVID-19 sitting in parliament.
The Prime Minister will be there.
We'll take a short break.
I'm rosemary Barton.
You are watching CBC news network.



**Rosemary**:

I'm rosemarybarton here in the nation'scapital and thanks for joining us on CBC news network." we're here with all of your latest COVID-19 news this hour.
Ottawa has unveiled the new support for commercial landlord sand tenants that will start, applications start to be received next week.
The Prime Minister says thecanada emergency commercial rent assistance programme will provide forgivable loans to reduce rent by some 75% for commercial businesses.
Questions are already being asked and raised, though, about whether this help might becoming too late for some businesses that may have already been forced to close because they weren't able to pay their rent and we'll have live updates from governments across the country and health officials, too, throughout the day.
Justin Trudeau also told us this morning that we can expect to hear new direction on mask wearing from public healthofficials.
As we stand by to bring you the briefing from our chief publicofficer, Dr. Theresa tam and thecovid committee where they will be asking questions of the Prime Minister.
We'll bring that to you in the next hour and I'll bring in mycolleagues, Massey kapelos anddavid Cochran.
I don't know what we'll hear about masks.
But I thought it was interesting to hear the prime minister reflect on why and how he is choosing to wear masks right no wand I know we have a camera headed up to catch him on hi sway in. We've seen him a few time swearing masks, namely at thefuneral, the memorial held for the helicopter crash.
This picture here was when he was talking to Ottawa public health officials.
Limited in terms of space buthe's wearing it more regularly when he feels he can't maintain that physical distancing.
It was interesting to hear him reflect on that.



**Vassy**:

He said, basically, for today, he's going into the committee in-person inparliament and evolves into asitting and he'll wear the mask, he said, on his way there.
When enters the building, he'lltake it off when he hasappropriate physical distancingto answer questions or what haveyou and he'll put it on as heexits or as soon as that part isdone.
I think that the guidance fromdr.
Tam is highly anticipatedand I would say that onlybecause he's seen in otherjurisdictions.
There would be blanketdirections.
You should be wearing them ifyou go here or there.
It's very clear and especiallyimportant, I think, for thatquestion to be answeredexplicitly by public healthofficials and they have beentalking in the past month or sois here is what it does and whenit might be appropriate to useimprovement.
It. If there was an explicit pieceof advice, as businesses reopen, it's especially reopen becausewe've heard from a number ofbusinesses what they should bedoing and expecting exfrompeople when they're shopping orgoing into outlets.
I talked to mayor tory callingfor specifically this, veryconcrete advice or guidance frompublic health officials that isconsistently applied.
He said that consistency is whatis most important.
So I'm eagerly awaiting to hearfrom Dr. Tam on that, as well.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Tam speaks with her provisional counterparts and they would have to agree on where they would be on the advice of masks, ofcourse.
It took awhile for any advice to be given at all in this country.
Culturally we're not used to wearing masks.
Although, you see it a fair bit right now.
It will be interesting to see whether it's a, mandatory like in jurisdictions like new yorkand where it's mandatory, ifit's on transit, in stores.
David, obviously, you see people more and more wearing them and sometimes in places where you'reconfused.
But why are you wearing a ma skin the park where there's nobody near you.
But it would be get to get clear advice to make the bestdecisions.



**David**:

I'm unclear on the jurisdictional enforcement, whether that would fall to the provisional health authorities or local health authorities.
I the suspect that may be theapproach.
It way the public health agency has operated to provide national benchmark guidance and have it strengthened or reduced based on the circumstances.
Whatever advice from Dr. Tam, ican't imagine it will be scalingback.
It's undoubtedly going to be an escalation and I think the Prime Minister wearing a mask as he went into parliament today, Guy who is comfortable in the symbolism of his job, that was gesture to show to the country, this is what you need to do. The science and opinion on this from the public health agency ofcanada, here is a video, our colleague was running the camera for me and we heard this would happen and he got his gear.



**Rosemary**:

He's that kind ofguy.
[ laughter ]



**David**:

It's not the sort of thing we see.
The head of the canadiangovernment wandering in public and we're used to see him getting out with security to keep him safe, but never wearing mask.
Not necessarily to keep him safe but the others around him safe.
This is the public health guidance on masks, is that my mask keeps you safe and My mask keeps me safe.
Having a clear set of guidelines from Dr. Tam with that visible example of the prime minister there will be an interesting message to send to the country as more and more parts of canadatentatively reopen economically.
Those workers you see, every time you go for your grocery or refill your prescriptions, they deserve whatever protection the country can give them and even if it's marginal or major, it'snot too much of a sacrifice to take when you look at the risk that minimum wage workers aretaking.



**Rosemary**:

Last week there was a picture on his officialphotograph's Instagram account, a space where you won't get distance from the security rcmpofficials who have to be withhim, RCMP officers who have to be with him and he was wearing am ask in the back there, too.



**David**:

and there'splexiglas, too.



**Rosemary**:

and you can seethe way that he, too, was having to adapt his life.
I mean, the other issue, iguess, would be where are you getting the masks? there are Mon medical grade masks and it took a month to get any masks arriving at My house.
It's an issue whether people can procure them, if you're at abusiness, if you have to wear them and all of those issues.
Dr. Tam is arriving here and we will wait to hear what her advice is and I will come back to both of you and we will take you inside the house of commons when that gets underway, as well.
But we don't want to miss out on what Dr. Tam has to say.
We'll pull away from this once the Prime Minister starts, if need be, and we can come back toit.
We'll buy time on medicaltherapist.
Therapies.
We won't get through this on hope alone.
For the weeks and months ahead, we'll need to continue to pro peach other up with creativity, kindness and patience.
When it comes to summerreopening, keeping our two metres is a must, and outside spaces are better than inside.
Small bubbles of core contacts are better than big and goodhandwashing is the right accessory for all venues andoccasions.
Thank you.
Merci.



Bonn jour.



Good afternoon, as usual, Will start with the latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada.
There are now 79, 491 cases including 5, 955 deaths and40, 342 or 51% now recovered.
Labs across Canada have tested over 1, 372, 000 people pertesting.
and about 5% testing testing positive overall.
We are now testing an average of28, 000 people daily and these numbers change quickly and are updated regularly oncanada.
Ca/coronavirus.
As Canada's COVID-19 pandemiccontinues to slow and provincesand territories proceed withcareful reopening plans, we arethinking more and more about howto proceed.
Through the springand summer moeand patience will be our biggestvirtues during this time.
Until effective therapies or avaccine is widely available, ouraim must be to carefully balancethe direct risks associated withcovid-19 epidemic activity withthe unintended health, socialand economic consequences.
Now that means reopening tolessen negative consequenceswhile maintaining core publichealth practices to keepcovid-19 activity to a lowlevel.
For the spring and summermonths, strict adherence to thepublic health basics of physicaldistancing, handwashing andcough etiquette must continue asthe bear minimum.
In addition, where COVID-19activity is occurring, use ofnonmedical masks or facecoverings is recommended as anadded layer of protection whenphysical distancing is difficultto maintain and we will bepublishing recommendations todayand staying home when sick is amust always and everywhere.
If we can all maintain thesemeasures, we stand the bestchance of keeping COVID-19activity down through the springand summer.
This will give us more lead timeto work on a full range ofpreparedness activities inreadiness for whatever may comethis fall and winter.
As well, suppressing diseaseactivity throughout the summerwill continue to buy time forresearch and innovation onmedical therapies and vaccinedevelopment.
We know that this may not be thegrand reopening we might haveliked, but we will not getthrough this on hope alone.
Wore the weeks and months ahead, we'll need to prop each other upwith creativity and kindness.
When it comes to summerreopening, keeping our twometre's distance is a must.
Outside spaces are better thaninside and small bubbles of corecontact are better than big andgood handwashing is the rightaccessory for all venues andoccasions.
Thank you.
