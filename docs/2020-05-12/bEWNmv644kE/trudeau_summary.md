Announcing new measures to support seniors during this pandemic.
This means that across the country, almost seven million seniors will get the help that they need.
and to better support the most vulnerable seniors, we will give an extra $200 for people eligible for the guaranteed income supplement. I.s., you will get an additional $500 in total to help you.
Our government is also investing an additional 2k4r0r million for the new horizons for seniors programme.
a few weeks ago we boosted funding so organisations can provide delivery services and help seniors stay in touch with family during the pandemic.
So, we're making another investment today to create more programmes to help isolated seniors and improve their quality of life.
Now there is no question that COVID-19 has been taking its toll on seniors, both emotionally and financially.
Including how we care for seniors in Canada.
There are serious, underlying challenges facing these facilities and, in the coming months, the federal government would be there to help the provinces find lasting solutions.




Every Canadian, no matter where they live or what they do, has a role to play in supporting our seniors during this pandemic.
a lot of people, especially single seniors, are feeling really lonely right now.
Consider writing a letter or a postcard to isolated seniors, volunteer with a local organization to fight the isolation of seniors.
