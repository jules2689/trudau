# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to note that earlier this morning, Minister Gould afoundsed a contribution to the vaccine initiative, Gavin, the vaccine ahindsing, Gavin and the global polio eradication initiative.
These organisations deliver vaccines to the world's most vulnerable, saving millions of lives.
Most recently, they are developing to respond to disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Once the COVID-19 vaccine is available, Gavin will help get it to the people who need it. and that will keep us all safer.
Because in our interconnected world, to end this pandemic for good in Canada, we have to end it everywhere.




**Interpreter**:

As we know only too well, the last few weeks have been particularly tough for seniors and their families.
Our parents and grandparents are more at risk of catching COVID-19 and of suffering the most serious consequences.
Right across the country, the long-term care homes and seniors homes have been the most hard-hit by the pandemic.
Exposing the failures of a system that must be strengthened.
But the challenges of the pandemic for seniors are not just limited to what's happening in seniors homes.
The lockdown is weighing heavily on seniors across the country.
They spend a lot of time alone and separated from their families.
and because they're supposed to not go out as much as possible, they can't use public transit.
They rely on delivery services to do their errands and often that means they can't take advantage of sales in stores.
It's hard on their morale as well as on their finances.
So today, our government is announcing new measures to help our seniors get through this crisis.
First of all, if you receive old age security, you will be receiving $300 more to help you with the cost that you've had to incur as a result of COVID-19. Right across the country, we're talking about almost seven million people who will be receiving more money in the coming weeks.
and to help those seniors who are most vulnerable, we will also be providing an additional $200 to all of those who are eligible for the guaranteed income supplement.
That means that if you are receiving both o. a.s. and the g. I.s., you will receive $500 more.
Our government will also be granting $20 million more to the new horizons for seniors programme.
We did make changes to that programme several weeks ago, to allow organisations to adjust their services to, based on the realities of pandemic, and help seniors remain in contact with their families.
So, we're again investing in that programme to provide for more activities that will counter the isolation of seniors and improve their quality of life.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Announcing new measures to support seniors during this pandemic.
First, if you're receiving old-age security, you will get an additional $300 to offset some of the extra costs you've had to cover because of the virus.
This means that across the country, almost seven million seniors will get the help that they need.
and to better support the most vulnerable seniors, we will give an extra $200 for people eligible for the guaranteed income supplement.
If you are receiving o. a.s. and g. I.s., you will get an additional $500 in total to help you.
Our government is also investing an additional 2k4r0r million for the new horizons for seniors programme.
a few weeks ago we boosted funding so organisations can provide delivery services and help seniors stay in touch with family during the pandemic.
So, we're making another investment today to create more programmes to help isolated seniors and improve their quality of life.
Now there is no question that COVID-19 has been taking its toll on seniors, both emotionally and financially.
and with today's announcement, our government is taking action to alleviate some of the stress they may be feeling.
But there is a lot more work to be done.
Not only to find short term fixes, but long-term solutions.
COVID-19 has exposed some uncomfortable truths about our society.
Including how we care for seniors in Canada.
We've seen heartbreaking tragedies in long-term care facilities and nursing homes across the country.
Overworked staff, understaffed residences, grieving families.
There are serious, underlying challenges facing these facilities and, in the coming months, the federal government would be there to help the provinces find lasting solutions.




**Interpreter**:

Since this crisis began, we have witnessed heartbreaking scenes in long-term care facilities and seniors residences across the country.
Overwhelmed caregivers, overcrowded residences and families in mourning.
These facilities are facing significant challenges.
and in the coming months, the federal government will be there to help the provinces address those challenges.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Every Canadian, no matter where they live or what they do, has a role to play in supporting our seniors during this pandemic.
It starts with following public health recommendations.
You know the drill -- stay home, washing our hands and keeping a safe distance from others when we go out.
That's how we can protect the physical health of our parents and grandparents during this pandemic, but let's not forget about their mental health.
a lot of people, especially single seniors, are feeling really lonely right now.
So call your grandparents, ask them how their day is going, how they're doing, and how you can help.
Consider writing a letter or a postcard to isolated seniors, volunteer with a local organization to fight the isolation of seniors.
We need to be there for those who have built this country for the rest of us and that's what Canadians will continue to do. and, together, we will get through this.
Merci.



Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll go to the phone for questions.
One question, one follow-up. Over to you, operator.
