First question, TVA.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
With respect to support for seniors, the amount you are announcing today do not reflect what some groups were asking for.
Some people were asking for monthly increases.
is this something that you could do? similar to what you've done for students? well, from the beginning of this pandemic, we've known that seniors are the most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19. and that is why we brought in so many measures as a society to try and protect our parents and grandparents.
By staying home and by preventing the spread of COVID-19 right across the country.
At the same time, we took concrete measures through United Way, through g. S.t. Tax credit that helped a lot of seniors.
and today we're moving forward again to help these seniors who are feeling a lot of anxiety and having to incur extra costs.
Of course, from the very beginning, we have been focused on the people who have lost their income.
Such as workers who lost their job or students who will not have a summer job this year.
and be unable to pay their tuition next year.
But as you can see, we will be there for everyone, all members of society who need our thoep hep them get through this crisis.
That is what Canadians do. We help each other and that continues today.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the beginning we erect niezed that seniors are as a result negotiable COVID-19 as a disease.
That is why we talked about the need to protect our partners and grandparents by slowing the spread of the virus, by keeping people safe.
The same time, we did move forward on direct measures to support most vulnerable seniors through organisations like the United Way and the g. S.t. That was increased is going to help -- help significantly large number of seniors.
But today we're announcing more help.
Because we recognize that every week, seniors are out of pocket a little bit more for delivery costs for groceries or other things that they're challenged with, which is why we're stepping up on sending seniors the help they need.

**Interpreter**:

With respect to the long-term care facilities, Mr. Singh was saying that private homes should be nationalized.
is this something that you're? inger what do you see as solutions for the tragedy we're seeing in seniors homes? simply transferring money to the provinces or do you feel you should play a more active role as the federal government? first of all, it is not up to the federal government to provide a solution with respect to these long-term care facilities.
This falls within provincial jurisdiction.
At the same time, we will be there to help and to support the provinces in looking at the various options.
I think Canadians across this country are asking just how we should be looking after our elderly and in the coming months and years there has to be improvements.
But it will be up to the provinces to determine what needs to be done and the federal government will be there to support the provinces in terms of the assistance they need and the changes they wish to make.

Next question, Canadian press.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Yes.
Thank you for talking to us today.
The deputy Prime Minister suggested yesterday that traffic between the United States and Canada is bound to increase as states and provinces re-open.
What specifically is the government planning to do to deal with an increase in inbound photographic the United States, considering the risk of infection?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We're going to continue to be very careful about vectors of infection into Canada, that means continuing with restrictions on international travel.
At the same time, we have brought in measures that means anyone coming in to Canada, returning residents particularly, will need to self-isolate for two weeks.
We are looking at stronger measures to make sure that we're following up appropriately on people coming over.
Because as we know, as economic activity starts to ramp up and restrictions are loosened across countries, it is likely that we see a few more people either returning home or a few more people trying to cross the border.
We need to make sure that the measures that we're bringing forward are going to keep Canadians safe.



Follow-up, please.



**Reporter**:

Given the recovery challenges that lie ahead, is now the time to ensure all Canadians, especially nonsalaried workers have access to affordable child care?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think one of things that we've seen particularly when many of the very first jobs lost during this crisis were ones held by women, dis portion Natalie held by women t need for child care has never been made clearer.
That's why we will continue to work with provinces and municipalities on ensuring that there are affordable child care spaces across the country.
Over the last five years, we've made significant investments in child care and we'll continue to do that.
It is a responsibility that we share with the provinces and we'll don't work with them to ensure that they are able to deliver the kind of child care that is needed for their society.




**Interpreter**:

We recognize that daycare centres are absolutely essential for people to be able to work and the fact is that, from the beginning of this crisis, many people have lost their jobs and, of course, when we're going to want to re-open the economy, we'll have to ensure that there are enough spaces in child care centres from.
The beginning of our mandate five years ago, we were there helping to provide daycare services and we'll continue to be there and discuss this with the provinces to ensure that we have a better daycare system across the country.

**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
You announced yesterday the big business programme will require companies to produce reports on how their actions contribute to national climate change goals.
The initial reaction is that most energy companies are already producing reports like this.
is this a matter of asking companies to maintain their existing level of climate reporting or asking them to do something beyond that.
If so, what would that look like?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As you pointed out, there are many companies in the energy sector that are already taking seriously the need to plan for the longer term, to plan for reducing emissions and fighting climate change.
But not all of them and that is why we needed to make sure that, as we move forward on support for large employers across all sectors that they are also, in all sectors, not just the energy sector, thinking about the challenge that climate change pose to their company and to their future.
and have a response for it.



**Reporter**:

Again on the loan programme, it is clear that large companies that are -- that have been convicted of tax evasion don't qualify.
But yesterday in your comments, you went further and said that the government will watch for, quote, aggressive tax avoidance.
What does that mean?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think Canadians expect that if we're going to be putting taxpayer dollars, public money towards supporting these companies, that they be paying their fair share of taxes.
We recognize that companies have often very complex ways of managing and structuring their revenue and their portfolios.
But if they want to apply for the large enterprise emergency financing facility, they are going to have to demonstrate a level of transparency that shows how they organize their structures so we can make determinations around whether they are, indeed, paying their fair share of taxes before we put in Canadian money.
Ok. 



**Interpreter**:

We recognize that many large corporations have different structures in order to minimize the taxes they have to pay.
But Canadians do expect that people who are receiving public money should pay their fair share of taxes.
So, we're demanding a certain amount of openness and transparency from those companies so they can show us that they paid their fair share of taxes and are not using certain means to try and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.
We want to ensure that if they're receiving public money, they are and have been making a proper contribution through taxes.



More questions from the phone.

**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
You announced a succession [inaudible] financial assistance for workers, for families and an improvement to the c. B. there was support for students today and seniors.
Now how do you explain the fact that seniors have come at the very end of this long list of measures you've brought in? no, quite the contrary.
We always recognize that seniors were the most vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their health status and their age.
and that is why, right from the beginning, we brought in measures to protect them.
By encouraging people to stay home, not to go and see their grandparents, by helping them through organisations such as the United Way or giving them more money through a g. S.t. Tax credit.
and we have been there to support seniors.
But at the same time, today, we are going even further in supporting them.
We will be sending a $300 million cheque to seniors across the country with a $200 bonus for all of those who are also receiving the guaranteed income supplement because they are the most vulnerable Canadians.
We have to support all sectors of the economy and we recognized right from the beginning that people who had lost their income or lost their paycheques are students who would not have a summer job.
Starting in May.
They needed immediate help from the government.
But now we're very pleased to be able to help seniors who are incurring additional expenses and this will help.
Follow-up? yes, with respect to the border between Canada and the United States, we assume that there are discussions about re-opening the border and renegotiating the agreement that goes to may 21. But in that area, My question remains will you or will you not re-open the border on may 21. Well, as you've seen from the very beginning, our discussions with the United States are extremely important in terms of ensuring that restrictions are in place, but also for ensuring that essential goods and services can continue to cross the borders in these difficult times of COVID-19. and that is why we're in constant discussion with the United States on issues such as the border and other shared issues.
and I can tell you that those conversations are always very positive and constructive.
Christian noel, radio-Canada.
Seniors are among the most vulnerable people and they're facing increased cost that they can't necessarily pay.
and yet you're only giving them a one-time payment.
a maximum of $500.
and some will be receiving less.
Why do you think that $500 in your heart? is that enough for our seniors? well, we know that a there are many people out there who have lost their source of income as a result of this pandemic.
They've lost their paycheque.
Students will not have their summer job.
Workers will not be able to make any money, money that they were relying on in order to pay for their groceries or pay their rent.
Seniors are not generally in a situation where they have lost their income.
But they are facing additional costs, including additional stress and anxiety because of their health status and their vulnerability to COVID-19. and that is why we recognize that giving them additional help will make a big difference.
We're giving $300 to all seniors who qualify for o. a.s. and $200 more for people receiving g. I.s. But yourself in the place of a senior who will be receiving $500.
If that lasts a year, that means $41 a month or $10 more a week.
What do you want them to do with so little money? well, we know this is an unprecedented situation and we're taking action now and for the months to come.
Obviously if the situation continues for six months or a year, we will have to introduce new measures and have additional reflection on how we're going to support seniors, young people, businesses, workers.
The help that we're providing now is short-term help for the emergency we are facing.
As you've seen, as we move forward, we will always be adjusting our action whenever necessary to ensure that people receive the help they need.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

One of things we've seen in this unprecedented situation is we need to remain flexible and support people with what they need when they need it. Obviously if this continues for another six months or year, we'll have to continue to make adjustments and extend many programmes.
But right now what we're looking at is the short term support that is needed to get Canadians through this so that we can come out the other side and restart the economy soon and we won't need to look at what we might need to do in six months if we're still, heaven forbid, all locked down still.
We want to get through this.
We want to get through this quickly.
But we know that we need to support people right now as we get through this and that is what this extra help for seniors will help with.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, Chinese Canadians, including human rights advocates Anastasia Lin, say community members are under pressure from the Chinese government for their influence networks around the world, like united front.
They fear for family members back in china if they speak out and they also say that they don't have any support here in Ottawa.
and I'm just wondering what your government is doing to expose and stop the insolence of the united front here in Canada.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The Canadian government has always highlighted concerns around human rights and respect for basic human democracies and liberties with every country that we engage with around the world.
Including china.
At the same time, we're strong supporters and defenders of the right to free speech, the right to protest t right to express themselves here in Canada and elsewhere around the world.
We will continue to defend human rights while at the same time, looking to protect Canadians everywhere around the world.
and this is something we'll continue to do. 



**Interpreter**:

We've always been very clear in our defence of human rights and freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and freedom of demonstration and we will always defend the canadian's rights to do that.
In many, many different circumstances, we have defended human rights with the Chinese government.



**Reporter**:

The agreement to shut down the Canada-United States border expires next week.
a number of provinces said that they don't want that border to re-open.
Do you -- is there a time period as to how much longer we expect that to be closed and what about the tourism sector that relies so heavily on visitors from the south?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We have taken necessary measures to keep Canadians safe.
That has been our priority and because that has meant negative economic impact for many sectors across the country, we have moved forward with supports for worker across the country.
But our priority needs to be keeping Canadians safe and that is the spirit in which we have engaged in constant and constructive dialogue with the Americans to talk about shared interests, including the border and I have no doubt we'll have more to say in the coming days on how we continue to move forward in a way that keeps Canadians safe.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Olivia stefanovich.
CBC news.
What does Canada need to see on both sides of boards easier before you consent to allowing nonessential travel?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think we all are focused right now on ensuring flattening of the curve, recreation -- decreasing of the cases of COVID-19 so we can restart certain sectors of economy.
That must be done gradually and with tremendous vigilance and we need make sure that we have the mechanisms and materials in place to deal with any further spreads or spikes in COVID-19. Preventing transmission from outside of Canada into Canada once we have control ed the spread within Canada will be an essential part of ensuring that we don't fall back into a second wave that could be as serious as this wave we're going through or even more so. So we're going to be very, very careful about re-opening any international travel, including the United States, before we feel that it is time.




**Interpreter**:

We know that what we're trying to do now is protect Canadians.
By preventing the spread of COVID-19 within Canada.
As a result, we must control the transmission between Canadians and ensure that in Canada, we are massively reducing the number of cases.
That being the case, of course, we'll be vulnerable to cases coming from outside and that is why we have to be vigilant and attentive as to how we can ensure that COVID-19 does not come into Canada and prevent a second wave that is as bad or worse than the one we're in now.
So we will be very attentive and be very cautious when it comes to re-opening international travel.

Wet'swet'en chiefs are calling for the resignation of Carolyn benefit note because she failed to consult with leadership over a memorandum of understanding which they're calling your government to reject.
What is your response to these calls and will the virtual signing scheduled for may 14 of this memorandum of understanding still go ahead?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to begin by thanking Minister Bennett for the extraordinary work that she has done over the past months, and continues to do on a very difficult issue that has gone on for decades now.
The challenges facing the wet'swet'en are cog -- significant in terms of how they engage and work with the federal government and we'll always be there as a partner to listen, to work with them and to continue moving forward on the path to reconciliation and partnership.




**Interpreter**:

First of all, thanks to Minister Bennett for her leadership and the approach she took in working with the wet'swet'en on these very difficult issues.
That have been around for decades.
and as the federal government, we will always be there to work with the community, to try and support them and help them, to address the challenges they are facing.
We know that the path to reconciliation has to go through partnership and we will be there.



**Reporter**:

Yesterday you said that the fed era government would be the lender of last resort to these companies that come to the federal government asking for money.
That means that banks, private investors and pension funds, they will have presumably said no to these companies, we don't want to in in you.
Do you think that the federal government is taking on too much risk if the market has said no to these companies already?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

There are big companies in Canada who employ thousands upon thousands of Canadians for whom the than er private lieutenanters might have of whether or not it is profitable is not the only issue that a government needs to look at. We know that if significant numbers of Canadians lose their jobs for good because of COVID-19, if big employers go under purely because of COVID-19 because they didn't have the liquidity to make it through this, then our economy will not only be worse a off a, but we'll have more trouble coming back.
That's why the government has put forward this large employer emergency financing facility to make sure that those companies that, if they were to go under because of COVID-19, you know, and impact on the livelihoods of thousands of Canadians for whom it would not be their fault, our government needs to be there.



**Interpreter**:

We recognize that there are large corporations that employ thousands and thousands of people.
and that there would be a long-term and injurious effect on our economy if they failed as a result of COVID-19. As a federal government, we have to be there for workers to ensure not only that our economy can come through this, but that it can rebound afterwards, and, therefore, we'll be there to provide liquidity to companies that cannot find that on private markers because we know that the impact on the canadian economy and on workers is just too greet allow them to fail.



You expected these companies need to be transparent with the federal government in terms the of tax evasion and other things that they've done.
Will you commit that the federal government will be transparent about the programme itself and make both the terms of the deal and amount of money given to these companies can completely public so Canadians can evaluate the deal that your government has done?



Prime Minister Trudeau's every step of the way, we've been open and transparent about the aid we've put forward during this unpress dened time and we'll continue to share with Canadians the information on what we're doing, to make sure that Canadians are kept safe and our economy is able to come roaring back afterwards.
