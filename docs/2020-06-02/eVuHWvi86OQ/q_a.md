Yes, Prime Minister.
Thanks for talking to us today.
I want to know what, if anything, your government plans to do to help Canadians and activists leave Hong Kong.
is Canada going to give advocates safe haven?



**Answer**:

Canada is place for people fleeing persecution and violence.
We look at cases and systemic challenges in response to that.
I know our system is doing just that.
 [voice of interpreter] for a very long time, Canada has given refuge to people fleeing violence around the globe.
We have a system in place to look at such cases and look at the issues involved and make the right decision.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Prime Minister.
a question on hockey first.
Will a Canadian study be able to present the playoffs or will that be too complicated?



**Answer**:

We know there are three cities that are interested in bringing in the NHL players for the playoffs, but first of all we need to ensure we are protecting our communities and our citizens.
So I know that the discussions are underway between the governments and the NHL, but it's too early to say what that will be. Many people would like to see this happen, but at the same time we need to make sure we're doing the right thing to protectcanadians.
[end of translation] I understand discussions are ongoing between the NHL, the government, and public health authorities.
Anyone would love to see game played in any number of canadiancities.
At the same time, we need to make sure what we're doing is keeping Canadians safe every step of the way.
That's why discussions are ongoing between public health and the interested parties.
 [voice of interpreter].

**Question**:

On the situation in the United States now, what do you think about using the army against the protesters and using tear gas At photo op?



**Answer**:

I think all canadiansare looking at this with concern and horror.
I think we all have to know that systemic discrimination, anti-black racism, and intolerance still exist in Canada.
These are acts of violence, but we're also talking about microaggression.
This is something that people face every single day.
We have to look at ourselves carefully, look at our systems, and work together to improve things here for Canadians of different origins.

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
On another topic there are some foreign ministers who are asking you to publicly denounce the annexation of certain territory by Israel.
I'd like to know what your comment is on this and why you haven't been more vocal on this.
Why haven't you denounced this?



**Answer**:

Well, I have been very clear that we continue to support a two-state solution andthat we do not agree with unilateral action on either side.
Of course we're very worried about the annexation being proposed by the israeli government.
I made that point directly to Prime Minister netanyahu and hisalternate PM benny ganz, when ispoke to them a few weeks ago.
We know the best way to address these challenges and to achieve peace in the middle east is through dialogue among the interested parties and not through unilateral actions such as this.
[end of translation] we are firmin our commitment to a two-statesolution as a country.
I have highlighted, both publicly and directly, to Prime Minister netanyahu and alternateprime Minister benny ganz the importance of staying away from measures that are unilateral andour deep concerns and disagreement with their proposedpolicy of annexation.
We think that the path forward is a two-state solution, reachedto by dialogue between the parties involved.
Anything that is unilateral action by either side is unhelpful in the cause of peace.

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] as a follow up, I understand that you're denouncing this, but is there something Canada can do? impose sanctions or bring pressure to bear on them? can we go further than just denouncing this kind of action so things don't get worse?



**Answer**:

Well, I made the point directly to Israeli leaders that we're very concerned about these actions and that we believe this will delay any progress and represent barrier to any progress in the middle east.
So we must work together based on dialogue and respect and this kind of action is of deep concern to us. [end of translation].

**Question**:

Hello, Prime Minister.
The final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls was released that concluded a genocide has happened in this country.
Do you believe that indigenous people have faced a genocide?



**Answer**:

I believe the situation indigenous people have faced for centuries is appalling and needs to stop.
It was called cultural genocide, which is strong words, and there are strong words necessary to talk about the continued injustice towards indigenous peoples which is ongoing in Canada, which is why we need to do better.
As a country, we need to work with indigenous partners on the road to reconciliation.
We need to be there in respect and partnership.
That is what our government has pledged to do.



is as a follow up.

---

**Question**:

Yes.
What word would you use to describe this? you mentioned cultural genocide.
What word would you use to describe this?



**Answer**:

You know, I think the words that we continue to focus on is how we use "reconciliation, partnership, shared stewardship of the land," how we reach out a hand to fix the grievous historical wrongs.
We need to be focused on building a better present and future.
That means recognizing the past, but also putting in place the partnerships to move forward.
There are lots of words that can be used.
We need to use them and move forward.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, molly Thomas, CTV national words.
We have less than 10% of n95 masks that we have asked for across the globe, a fraction of the gowns and gloves we need.
How far away are we from domestically supplying all the P.P.E. In Canada, are we 20% there or 50% there? how far along are we?



**Answer**:

From the very beginning we have worked hard to ensure our front line workers across the country get the P.P.E. They need.
We have worked with partners around the globe to make sure our workers are protected.
We've restarted domestic production of many of these items so that we don't have to be just reliant on overseas imports.
That has worked very, very well.
We continue to have enough supplies to supply the provinces in their needs right now.
As we reopen, we know we're going to need more, as more and more industries begin to restartand need P.P.E. That's why we're continuing to ramp up production, we're continuing to ramp up the scale of importation.
We will continue to ensure that there is enough P.P.E. Right across the country.

**Question**:

Hi, Prime Minister, tom Perry, CBC.
You've been reluctant to comment on the words and actions of the United States president, but we have Donald trump calling for military action against protesters.
We saw protesters tear gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo op. I'd like you to comment.
If you don't want to comment, what message do you think you'resending? ?



**Answer**:

We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States.
It is time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen.
It is a time to learn what injustices continue, despite progress over years and decades.
It is a time for us as canadiansto recognize that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day.
There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of colour, Canadians who are racialized differently than they do others.
It is something that many of us don't see, but it is something that is a lived reality for racialized Canadians.
We need to see that, not just as a government and take action, but we need to see that as Canadians.
We need to be allies in the fight against discrimination.
We need to listen.
We need to learn.
We need to work hard to fix, to figure out how we can be part of the solution on fixing things.
This government has done a number of things over the past years, but there is lots more todo.
We will continue to do that because we see, we see you, we see the discrimination that racialized Canadians live every single day.
 [voice of interpreter] of course we are watching what is happening in the United States with a great deal of concern.
We know that this is a time where people have to listen and learn and take action.
But here in Canada, we also are facing major challenges.
Systemic discrimination exists in this country, and that means that our systems, our institutions, and everything that we have in place in this country does not provide for equal treatment of Canadians of different origins.
Understanding that reality, truly understanding it, not just seeing the contrast with the United States and saying, oh, well things are a lot better here.
But actually saying we have major challenges here in Canada as well and we have to act to eradicate them.
That is what brings us today to reflect on everything we can do as individuals, as allies, to understand the lived reality of Canadians of different origins and to be there to help them, to support them, to listen to them, to work with them, to build a life founded on respect for eachother.

**Question**:

Why, though, are you so reluctant to comment directly on the words and the actions of the United States president?



**Answer**:

My job as the Canadian Prime Minister is to stand up for Canadians, to stand up for our interests, to stand up for our values.
That is what I have done from the very beginning and that is what I will continue to do. Canadians need a government that will be there for them, that will support them, and that will move us forward in the right direction, and I will do that.
 [voice of interpreter] Canadians need a government that will be there to defend them and to protect them and support interests and values of Canadians.
That's what I've always done and will always do. [end of translation].

**Question**:

Prime Minister, in 2017 a u. N. report on anti-blackracism in Canada found continuedconditions deplorable.
They talked about the inequitiesthat continue in Nova Scotia 30 years after segregation ended.
One of their recommendations wasfor your government to issue an apology for Canada's history of slavery and other historical inequalities and to issue reparations.
Why haven't you done that and will you do that?



**Answer**:

Over the past years our government has worked closely with the black community, with members and leaders in the community to respond to the very many tangible things that need to be done to support black Canadians to counter the systemic racism and systemic discrimination that continues to exist within Canada, within our institutions, everything from micro aggression's to acts of violence are part of the daily lived reality for far too many Canadians.
What we're seeing in the United States and what canadiansare speaking about here in Canada underlines the fact that we need to act.
Acting means many things.
Yes, we've created more funding for community organizations.
We've invested in statistics Canada to collect more dis aggregated data.
There is more to do. We're working with the black business community to make sure there is better access to capital for young entrepreneurs so there are economic opportunities going forward.
We need to take a hard look at our institutions and structures, to make sure that those barriers that may be invisible to many ofus, but far too present for black and racialized Canadians are addressed.
We will continue to work with the black community on the things we need to do.  [voice of interpreter] for a number of years now, we have been working with the black community right across the country to respond to its needs and to address what they are experiencing every day.
We have provided additional funding for community organizations.
We are helping statistics canadato collect better data, more specific data.
We're also investing to support black entrepreneurs from variouscommunities.
These are investments we're making to build resilience in these communities.
That is important as well.
We will continue to work with the community on issues of concern to them.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

My question is veryspecific.
You say you've had time to talk to leaders in the black community, people in the black community, and you've had this report now for almost three years and you still can't answer this question.
Will you issue an apology and will your government roll out reparations?



**Answer**:

We will work with the black community in this country as we have to respond to their priorities.
There is a lot to do in Canada and we will do it in partnership with them.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] yesterday you talked about the efforts being made to collect ethnic data on various groups.
Now, is there a blockage happening in certain provinces and when can we expect to get that more specific data?



**Answer**:

We're working with the provinces on data collection at this time.
This is an issue we have been working on for some time now, collecting ethno-graphic data issomething we've been working on and we're trying to address thatneed now.
The reality is for much of the data we've already collected, it's much too late to go in and look at more specific, detailed information.
We have to change our systems quickly to be able to do that.

**Question**:

There's some information that air Canada would like to get out of the transaction with air transat.
Now, what can you tell us about that and can you do something to ensure that air Canada can now withdraw from that transaction?



**Answer**:

Well, we're in a difficult context at this time and that's the case for many businesses.
We know that the decisions being made by businesses in this situation are not necessarily ideal.
We will continue to work with the airline industry to support Canadian travellers and we will be looking at this specific transaction between air Canada and air trans at to see what needs to be done to make sure Canada remains a competitive country globally for airline travel.

**Question**:

You and your government have defended the W.H.O. Repeatedly and refused to say whether you trust the data china was providing early on. Even your health Minister has accused journalists of questioning the data pummelling conspiracy theories.
I'm wondering, do you believe the chinese data can be trusted and do you believe the W.H.O. Was wrong to praise the regime even though they weren't gettingthe information they needed early on?



**Answer**:

I think there are questions that need to be asked about the W.H.O. and china and other country's behaviours through this.
We need to focus on doing everything we can to keep Canadians safe and to end this pandemic not just in Canada but around the world.
The W.H.O. Remains an important partner and ally in doing that.
There are answers we need going forward and those questions willbe asked and answered as we moveforward.
