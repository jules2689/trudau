# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada on this Tuesday addressing the country.
He's now going to head to parliament to the west block specifically to take part in thecovid-19 committee which will start at noon.
We are expecting the Prime Minister and the other leaders of parties to make remarks about the racism and the protests and the rallies we have seen in thiscountry, but of course in the United States.
That's where I will bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and the cbc's David Cochrane.
Our own tom Perry asked a question of the Prime Minister to try to get him to respond to the remarks made by the president last night and then the behaviour of the president last night, having protesters tear gassed from the lawn of the white house so he could cross the street and head into a church.
It took the Prime Minister some 21 second to come up with a response.
It was an interesting response and it was an interesting 21 seconds to see the Prime Minister's mind sort of click through what he could and could not say about that.
Vassy, I'll start with you.



**Vassy**:

That's interesting.
Normally I look down and take notes during it. I wasn't watching it. I heard the pause and thought something was wrong with My ear piece.
It ended up being 21 seconds before the Prime Minister answered the question from our colleague tom, which was very specific.
It was based on what you described, Rosie last night, when the president stepped out into the rose garden and labelled the protests and what was happening in the United States and the violent side domestic terrorists.
There was back-lash to that.
As you mentioned, police unleashed tear gas and pushed protesters away for him to walk to a church for a photo op with a bible.
That was the scenario tom was asking the Prime Minister to comment on. While he did pause for 21 seconds, there was no specific comment on the president or on the president's action.
Instead, the Prime Minister echoed what he said earlier and already earlier in the press conference, which was a focus onlooking inward in Canada on the systemic racism that exists hereand what kinds of actions peoplein this country and the governments what action they cantake.
Tom followed up by saying why aren't you going to comment.
He responded by saying he standsup for canadian values.
The situation is different.
I remember multiple situations where the president would do something and the prime ministerwould be asked to comment on it. He would talk about his job being to advance the interests of Canada and to stand up for canadian values, but rarely comment on what the president said.
There was an interesting exchange.
We are anticipating statements from him and other party leaders in the house of commons in abouthalf an hour.
There was an interesting question from the "the globe andmail" about a report out from the u. N. I had an opportunity a few months ago to read some of that.
There were some recommendations on considering reparations in this country or formally apologizing for the history of slavery in this country.
Some of the other recommendations around anti-racism measures from that committee were actually implemented by the government, but as you could see from the answer by the Prime Minister, onreparations, for example, or a formal apology, there has been no specific work done.
That same committee later on commented on some of the deficiencies in representation in political appointments for minorities in this government and in past governments.
I think that's another topic that should be discussed going forward.
I think those questions to the government are very genuine as well.



**Rosemary**:

David, before I get you to weigh in, I'm going to play it again in case people didn't see it. I can see some discomfort on the prime Minister's face in contemplating how he's going to respond to that.
That's My interpretation.
I'm not sure if that's what's happening.
Anyway, people can look and decide for themselves and I'll get you to weigh in. Here is how that exchange unfolded.

---

**Question**:

Tom Perry, CBC.
You've been reluctant to comment on the words and actions of the United States president, but we do have Donald trump now calling for military action against protesters.
We saw protesters tear gassed yesterday to make way or a presidential photo op. I want to ask you to comment and if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you'resending?



**Answer**:

We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States.
It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen.
It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.
But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day.
There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of colour, Canadians who are racialized differently than they do others.
It is something that many of us don't see, but it is something that is a lived reality for racialized Canadians.



**Rosemary**:

I will say, it's not just the discomfort and the sort of maybe self-censoring he was doing in his brain about howfar HF can go. Even the words "we watch in horror and consternation," that is not a condemnation of the president's actions, but it certainly gives you a peak into how the Prime Minister is viewing events as they unfold inthe unite States, some of whichare being fuelled by the president's comments.



**David**:

The way tom phrased the question, he said if you refuse to comment on the words and actions of the president, he paused for 21 seconds and then gave a long answer that did not comment on the words and actions of the president of the United States.
It has been a standard operating procedure of this government in its second mandate to avoid direct conflict with Donald trump whenever possible.
This is rapidly becoming a situation where we all saw this photo op, where they used mounted police officers, rubber bullets and tear gas to drive away peaceful protesters.
I should add some of the clergy that work in that church were there providing medical aid to people, protesters, to do with tear gas and P.P.E. spray.
They were forced out of their church by the actions of the federal police force.
These were not municipal, Washington, d. C., police officers who did this.
These were federal officers called in by the white house and the administration.
They have that authority in Washington, d. C., because it is a city, not a state with a governor.
It has a special status inside the United States, where they have their authority to bring in their federal police officers to do this sort of thing.
We have seen criticism coming to the United States from other foreign leaders.
Australia is asking why a cameraman for an Australian TV station was punched in the face in the events that preceded that photo op. Germany's foreign Minister has concerns about what has happened to German reporters.
We are hearing of reports being roughed up or detained by policeofficers.
It is easy I think for the Canadian government to criticize china for what is happening in Hong Kong, though people would say they're not nearly as forceful enough about their criticism of the Chinese regime because they are far away.
It is difficult when it's your ally and biggest trading partner and you're right across the border.
Tom and I were both with him on the plane during the black face scandal and he seemed more composed and able to answer those questions than he was now because of the anxiety that comes from the possibility of antagonizing Donald trump.
a time for great tension of that president and getting into his field of vision and antagonizing him is a very risky proposition for people right now, especially when we're counting on the United States to do things like mutually keep borders closed.
There's still a pandemic going on, even in the United States when those people are gathering due to anger.



**Rosemary**:

Tom did follow up. and he said he stands up for Canadians.
An interesting moment in time.
I'll come back to you, Vassy anddavid.
Another question the Prime Minister got, and this has been part of the conversation that links these questions of race and pandemic together around collecting data that better reflects race in this country, that reflects race at all in this country, frankly.
There's been lots of questions to the Prime Minister, to ministers, to the public health officer about why that didn't happen, what limitations that has on showing us how the pandemic may have affected different communities in this country.
Arjiman sajikki joins me now.
So good to see you.
Thanks for making the time.



**Interview**:

Thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

We have been on an doff talking about this through the pandemic.
This was raised by indigenous communities that we have a picture of things for indigenous and first nations people on reserve.
But it continues to be an obvious hole I would say in our understanding of the pandemic.
Can you tell me why that exists.
Why is that hole there?



**Interview**:

Yeah, it's a great question and I haven't been able to figure that out entirely, except that it is true that there seems to be a reluctance in Canada to document, document what's happening in our own society on an access of life and race that is so clearly embedded in all aspects of our society.
It's unfortunate that we're reluctant to put Kansas city, as I said, on facts that we know to be true.



**Rosemary**:

The Prime Minister was asked about this and he saidit's sometimes even hard to get age and gender, forget about race, which is also an issue.
Tell me about how that race-based information would help us contain the pandemic, would help us make systemic changes to health care, any of those things.



**Interview**:

If we look at places where data on race is readily available, like the United States, it's clear two things are happening.
One is you have the ability to say a lot about, a, what the situation is. B, what could be done to make the situation better.
Then to say, okay let's reflect on what our society is actually doing in relation to the data and the facts we should be doing in order to combat these inequities.
On the other hand, it's also clear from the United States that the data isn't enough.
It's not that advocating for race-based data is this pie in the sky attitude that if we onlyhave the data, then we'll fix everything.
No, not at all.
It's that the data helps us to hold policy makers accountable.
It helps us to understand our own society and then to have facts as an engine for the discourse of what's happening toracialized communities in Canada.



**Rosemary**:

For policy makers, it would help them make better decisions.
If you can focus in on a neighbourhood where people are affected differently, you can make better policy.
Wouldn't it be as simple as that?



**Interview**:

One would hope so. Sometimes data and facts help policy makers make decisions and they make decisions according to data and facts and sometimes they don't. So at the very least it helps us to understand what the facts are in relation to what policies are being made, but you're right, it would help us make better decisions.



**Rosemary**:

The city of torontohas revealed some information around neighbourhoods.
The island of Montreal, we've done reporting on communities hit and we know the population make-up there so we can extrapolate certain things.
We obviously would like to see more of that, but how would thatinformation then be used by people like you in understandingthings?



**Interview**:

Definitely would like to see more of that.
I think there are two parts to that.
One would be to have more regular collection of race-baseddata and greater availability.
The data that they collect only goes to a small set of people who are circumscribed to look atthe data, instead of letting thedata become part of the living conversations being had by the media, by scientists, and so on. Scientists like me use that datato try to ask deep questions about how policies are affectingcommunities, whether we should be making different decisions.
It's really important, because as scientists we have some independence and we aren't fuelled to the same extent by particular agendas.
It's really important that we have access to the data so we can provide a clear indication to Canadians, to the media, and to the public about what's happening in canadian society, who's being affected, how can wechange that, and so on.



**Rosemary**:

The only place really right now where we get that is the census in any detailed way.
is it racism itself, the fact that we don't gather this information? is it as simple as that or discriminatory? how would you characterize it?



**Interview**:

Yes, I think the best way to characterize it is the people who have the institutional capacity to make decisions about what data we collect and don't are not affected by these issues and may even have some incentives not to have that out there for the public.
The incentives to have the data to show systematically and factually what's happening in terms of inequality in Canadian society across racial groups, it's likely to be very damning evidence, very damning in terms of facts that are presented.
and at the very least, we can sort of surmise that the people making decisions around this sort of think twice whether they want those facts out there.



**Rosemary**:

Arjuman siddiqi, if you for joining us.



> we did hear there from the Prime Minister on the country's ongoing attempts to beef up our P.P.E., our personal protective equipment.
We know that is happening through purchases in other countries, but also through shoring up a domestic supply chain.
It has now become even more important, not only for the frontline workers and medical communities, but also people in private businesses because they are also in need of P.P.E. As economies continue to reopen.
Karen minicor works at a companyin Quebec that has signed an agreement to mass produce medical gowns for health care workers.
Thank you for joining us.



**Interview**:

Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

You signed a contract with the government.
Gowns are not talked about as much as masks, but also extremely important right now.
How many gowns were you commissioned to make? where are you at with that contract?



**Interview**:

The contract we have is for a six-month period.
We were contracted for more than11 million gowns.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
and how difficult -- you were already doing this kind of work, but how difficult was it to move from what you were doing to whatyou're doing now?



**Interview**:

Our specialty is uniforms.
We're doing not necessarily medical.
This is a new niche.
But we have a great supply chain across Canada that we were already producing 80% of our items here in Canada.
We were able to change direction of most of our suppliers to produce uniform items to gowns.



**Rosemary**:

As I said, we talk a lot about masks and a lot about gloves, not so much about gowns.
What's your understanding about how important and needed they are for front line workers?



**Interview**:

They are very important.
They allow for protection from water penetration and the pressure.
Level one would be for front workers and two and three -- as the risk increases, then you have a different type of gown that has a different type of fabric and sewing to protect thepeople.
We are also doing washable gowns so they can be reused.



**Rosemary**:

Interesting.
If you hadn't got this contract with the government, was your company on the verge of being affected by the pandemic, or were you going to be able to continue producing? what are some of the challenges you face as a company?



**Interview**:

We support around 4, 500 workers as subcontractors in Canada.
a lot of our plants had reduced operations, but we are an essential service.
We were operating, but at lower capacity.
This helped a lot of our subcontractors to reopen to produce these gowns.
and supporting jobs and supporting the economy.
It's a great thing.
We're quite glad.
As well, we had the expertise onhand.
We have an in-house lab and an expertise in textiles.
We were able to turn around quite quickly and producing it locally quickly.



**Rosemary**:

You do things for national defence and Canada post, so you're already sort of contributing to the country.
is this different? have you heard from your employees about how they feel to contributing to keeping people safe during a pandemic and being part of that Canadian team approach?



**Interview**:

Absolutely.
I was actually at the warehouse where we were cutting some of the fabrics for our suppliers.
Talking to one of My employees, she said she wakes up happy to be contributing to the cause andhelping.
a lot of the suppliers are open during the weekends.
When we called them and there was a first time for a requirement, it was Easter weekend.
They reopened quite quickly to help.
It's a great thing.
The community of industry helps each other in this time.



**Rosemary**:

It is nice to see.
It is one of the small silver linings in this.
Karin bibeau, thank you for making the time.
That was the v. P. of sales for logistic uni corp in Quebec, making gowns.



> I want to squeeze in another interview before the briefing from the cabinet ministers.
We are also expecting the COVID-19 committee to start off around noon with the Prime Minister and other party leaders in west block.
They will be making comments about race and racism in light of what we are seeing in the United States and how that has bled over into this country and some of the calls for action in Canada as well from black Canadians.
Let's talk now about another way that we are in this country trying to find a way to move forward and contain the pandemic.
Dr. Pubahat jag is an epidemiologist based in Toronto and he's leading a study that's testing the blood of 10, 000 Canadians for checking for COVID-19 antibodies, which is so interesting and really part of how we will get out of all this.
Nice to see you, doctor.



**Interview**:

Thank you, rosemary.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me how you're testing Canadians and what you're looking for.



**Interview**:

We're trying to understand a simple question.
How many Canadians are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. We will work with a reputable polling company, Angus Reid polling company and select 10, 000 or more Canadians who will be able to fill out a simple online form whether they had symptoms and ask whether they would agree to receive a simple kit at home which we would send them.
They do a little finger prick and put it on special paper and mail it back to us. Then we would be testing for antibodies to see if there is infection or past infection against the virus that causes COVID-19. We want to do this right across the country, and in particular we want to get a good sample of older Canadians because those are the groups that have been the most vulnerable to the effects of the virus.



**Rosemary**:

It's not necessarily people who tested positive, but people who had symptoms?



**Interview**:

That's right.
Well, we want to get everyone.
One of the problems of understanding the epidemic is if you simply rely on the test results, like the swab they do of your nose, those are sick or health-conscious seeking.
So then you don't get a true picture of the population.
We ask everyone if they have symptoms or not if they would contribute to the study.
What we have said in turn is theresults of the test we'll give back to the people.
We'll be able to tell them whether they are highly likely to have been infected, somewhat likely, or unlikely.
The reason we have that scale iswe don't want people to say these are immunity passports.
It will give us a very good sense of how many Canadians are infected, what's the distribution across the country.
Because we plan to ask people, can we come back to you in six months, we'll be able to answer key questions.
If I've got antibodies against the virus, how long does it last? does it fall away quickly like the common cold virus or stick around longer.
That's a key question that helpsus prepare for a second wave.



**Rosemary**:

How quickly can you get this done, doctor? I haven't had symptoms of COVID-19, but I'd like to know if I have antibodies or if I've become immune to it. How quickly can you get this done because lots of Canadians are interested to know the answer to this question.



**Interview**:

We want to get this out quickly as you've outlined in your show.
We think most Canadians peaked in April.
Typically it takes about a month before your body starts producing the antibodies that fight the virus and show in yourblood.
That would be about mid-may.
We don't know whether it falls very quickly or sticks around.
If we assume it falls quickly, we need to get the samples in quickly.
That's what we're hoping to get the kits out starting this week and into next.
The testing strategies have to be done carefully because you don't want wrong or misleading results, as has happened in someof the United States studies.
We'll do that carefully drawing on health Canada-approved tests and others.
The goal is perhaps by the end of June, early July, we can start to get some results from the study.



**Rosemary**:

That is very quick of course.
Everything is happening at a rapid speed in the scientific world right now.
Let me end on this question and you sort of alluded to it. Once people have this information, they shouldn't then assume that they are immune to the virus or that they can walk around and not physically distance or not wear a mask.
That is not the right way to interpret the information.
is that right?



**Interview**:

What we're asking Canadians in the study to do is help share their data.
They get some information that would be helpful to them, but by sharing our data, we get information that protects seniors and the most vulnerable.
In a war on COVID-19, we all have to be good citizens.
By sharing the blood, we're able to get an insight into how we can best fight the virus, and protect particularly seniors because that's been the big worry is hospitalization and deaths in our older citizens and ways of preventing that.



**Rosemary**:

Dr. Prabhat jha, thank you for your time.
He is an epidemiologist in Toronto.



> if you want to check in on the situation in Quebec, I should tell you that there is a briefing happening right now with the Quebec premier.
You see him there, franÇois legault.
We are waiting for the federal briefing, but if you want to watch that one, you can do that.
CBC.
Ca is where we're streaming briefings from across the country.
Quebec is under pressure, though the testing numbers have gone up significantly and that is encouraging.
CBC.
Ca is where you can continue to watch that.
I'm rosemary Barton here in Ottawa.
As we wait for the federal briefing with the deputy Prime Minister and other health officials to talk about what the prime Minister alluded to in his briefing to the country about an hour ago, specifically the updates on the state of P.P.E. Acquisitions here, meaning that personal protective equipment that we have been trying to procure from different countriesand to create in our own country, as you heard from our previous guest who has switched to making medical gowns.
We will hear from Minister anitaanand.
We are expecting the Prime Minister and the leader of the official opposition and others to make speeches in reaction to this call to look at racism inside our country and elsewhere, obviously spurred by the death that happened just a week or so ago in the United States, but now which hasled to widespread protests in the United States and in this country too.
I'll bring in My colleagues, thehost of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and the cbc's david Cochrane.
I don't know if you want to talkabout procurement.
We are expecting to hear from the Minister where we are at with that.
I would say that the pressure orthe complaints from provinces have really sort of tempered off.
That might be because we are in a different place with this pandemic.
There is private industry, regular citizens, things that are not medical grade.



**Vassy**:

The premiers have acknowledged this idea as the economy reopens, the need for that personal protective equipment will increase.
I thought it was interesting how the Prime Minister framed it in the vein of the announcement on municipalities.
This is part and parcel how jurisdictional issues are being smoothed over and the provinces and the Prime Minister or the federal government are working together to try to secure that P.P.E. He offered a little bit of an update on some of that procurement.
For example, 10 million gloves, 100 surgical masks.
There are still issues.
There wasn't an update there, soi will be looking for that in this briefing on n95 respirators.
a large number of those that have arrived are not up to canadian standards.
It will be interesting to hear what Minister anand says.
Something else I'm looking for from Minister navdeep Bains is about an industry council.
This will give us an indication of what industries they're looking at. The reason I raise it as an areato pay attention to, airlines, the tourism industry, we know there are particular industries, even oil and gas, that have beenhit extra hard.
Everyone has been hit, but thoseindustries in particular will see the effects of this pandemiclast for years, according to aircanada, for example.
What suite of measures is the government considering for thoseindustries beyond the programs that they've already offered, beyond, for example, the big loans to big companies.
I spoke with the transport Minister last week.
They haven't ruled out a bailoutfor airlines.
Will this group be looking at that.
I think we'll be getting an ideawhere the group is heading or what possible measures are in terms of who comprises the group.
That's something I'm looking outfor.



**Rosemary**:

David, anything you'll be listening intently for?



**David**:

One of the big concerns with the Meg Lanzhou decision in British Columbia about an attempt to have her extradition case thrown out is whether or not china would change its posture in terms of dealing with Canada in the delivery of P.P.E. Supplies.
I know we've had some problems with quality of the n95 masks coming out of there, but it is an important part of the supply chain for Canada as it tries to backstop at the federal level the supplies at a provincial level in industry.
I have been speaking with government sources and to their relief there has been no change.
There was some concern when menglost and faces a possible extradition to the United States, in retaliation ofwhat is happening with the huawei executive that there might be restrictions or more difficult in getting into china, getting into shanghai, getting materials to the warehouse and getting them on the plane and getting them out.
To this point, they have not seen any interruption in that.
That is a good thing.
To Vassy's point, we haven't heard the urgent cries from provinces.
So it seems like it has stabilized.
The big thing is the n95 masks coming from the United States.



**Rosemary**:

I have to cut you off because the Prime Minister is inside the house of commons speaking.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Prejudice, discrimination, and violence is a lived reality for far too manypeople.
It is a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate, inequality and injustice against people of colour.
As a country we are not concerned bystanders watching what is happening next door, we are part of it. The calls for justice, for equality, for peace have found echo in our communities because anti-black racism is happening here everywhere in Canada, everysingle day.
This is something that our own staff, cabinet ministers, and colleagues face even in these halls.
Over the past few days I've heard many of these personal stories directly from them.
I'm not just talking acts of violence, I'm also talking aboutmicro aggression which many of us may not see.
That is the daily reality of fartoo many racialized Canadians and it needs to stop.
When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past, mistakes I regret and continue to learn from.
I want to thank My colleagues, community leaders, and fellow Canadians for opening My eyes towhat is really going on in our communities and helping me both better understand privilege and power.
I'm not perfect, but not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing.
It's not an excuse to not step up, to stand up for each other, to be an ally.
I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician.
I'm not here today to describe areality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt.
I'm here because I want you to know our government is listening.
We hear your calls for justice, accountability, and equality.
We acknowledge your anger, your frustration, your heart break.
We see you.
 

[voice of interpreter] since coming to power, our government has taken several concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, and injustice across the country.
We are working with community leaders to bridge persistent gaps in Canada.
For example, we granted $9 million to support programs for young black Canadians.
We have made sizeable investments to allow the public health agency to allow more mental health services to those who have experienced racism or inter-generational trauma.
We are helping community actionsto obtain funding for the purchase of equipment or for rentals.
We created the anti-racism secretariat with a budget of $4.6 million to eliminate systemic obstacles, particularlyin terms of employment, justice, social participation, which perpetuates injustice.
We have made some progress, but we know that this work is far from over.


[end of translation] over the past five years, our government has worked with communities to recognize and address injustice.
We've taken action to support community organizations, invest in better data, and fightracism.
While we've made some progress, there is still so much to do. Here are the facts in Canada.
Anti-black racism is real.
Unconscious bias is real.
Systemic discrimination is real.
For millions of Canadians, it istheir daily lived reality.
and the pain and damage it causes is real too.
Mr. Speaker, every canadian who has felt the weight of oppression.
Every student who has the courage to demand a better future.
Every student who marches and demands and fights from vancouver to halifax expects more than the status quo.
They expect more and deserve better.
 

[voice of interpreter] the government of Canada has much work to do, but we're ready for it. We're ready to work with our colleagues from the opposition, with community leaders, and withcanadians to make our country a more equal and fair place.
There is never any place for racism here, and we are going tostop at nothing to eradicate it from coast to coast.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.


[applause].



The honourable leader of the opposition.



Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
We have all been affected by theheart-breaking killing in the past week of george floyd in the United states.
The video is painful to watch.
No one should ever have to pleadfor help while a crime is being committed, ignored by other members of law enforcement.
 [voice of interpreter] the marches, sit-ins, protests, and sadly in some cases riots, but I hope it has sparked conversations.
Racism is real, it is painful, and it is unacceptable.
[end of translation] Mr. Chair, the tragedy has sparked sit-ins, protests, riots, but I hope it has sparked conversations.
Racism is real, it is painful, and it is wrong.
No one should ever feel unsafe because of the colour of their skin especially around police officers who have a duty and responsibility to uphold the lawfor all.
Here in Canada we are fortunate to live in a country that is welcoming, tolerant, and inclusive.
Canada was a beacon of so many escaping slavery during the United States civil war.
Our nation has benefitted immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudice and discrimination to serve their communities and to make Canada abetter country.
Lincoln alexander was the first black member of parliament and went on to become the first black cabinet Minister.
John weir was born into slavery in south carolina, but followingthe american civil war brought the first cattle to Alberta and spearheaded the cattle industry.
Josiah henson who escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario.
and viola desmond.
Black Canadians have representedcanada with excellence and prideon the world stage.
Like harry jerome who represented Canada in three olympic games and won a bronze medal in 1964.
He would go on to become a teacher in British Columbia, serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation.
Throughout our history, black Canadians have put their lives on the line for their fellow Canadians, bravely serving around the world in the armed forces.
While there are many things we can point to in our history withpride, that is not to say we have a perfect record.
Nor are we immune to the threat of racism or that anti-black racism is just an american problem.
Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignored, and sadly not just in our past.
Every day there are people who experience discrimination or racism in some form.
Throughout this pandemic, we have seen a troubling spike in anti-asian racism.
No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour oftheir skin.
Nor should places oft worship be broken into or desecrated like the synagogue in montreal.
 [voice of interpreter] conservatives condemn all acts of anti-semitism, racism, and discrimination.
In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutelyno place for intolerance, racism, or extremism of any kind.
[end of translation] conservatives condemn all acts of anti-semitism, racism, and discrimination.
But the violence and the destruction we have seen in response are not the answer.
Millions of people are protesting peacefully across the United states and in Canada.
We must always protect the rights of those protesting peacefully and within the law for a just cause and separate them from those who exploit tragedies to commit acts of violence.
As Mr. Floyd's brother terrence said, violence will not bring his brother back.
Instead, he has called for peaceand justice and urged the crowdsto educate themselves and to vote.
Out of such tragedy, Mr. Speaker, that is a powerful message how we can use our democratic rights to effect change.
In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is no room for intolerance, discrimination.
We are all made in the likeness of god and because of that we are all equal and infinite valueexists in each of us. Ke is an incredibly diverse nation.
Canada stands on the lands of the first nations, inuit, and metis.
We are built on rock-solid values of enduring values, democratic values and fundamental and universal human rights.
 [voice of interpreter] they all came here because Canada is built on solidvalues.
Democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights.
[end of translation] protect these values because they are what set us apart.
They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot.
There are those that say diversity is our strength and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture.
Diversity is the result of our strength.
Our strength is and always has been our freedom.
 [voice of interpreter] our diversity is the result of our strength and our strength is and will always be our freedom.
[end of translation] the freedomfor people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions andthe opportunity to live in peacewith those around them.
The freedom to live your life with equality under the law regardless of your race or economic background.
The economic freedom that so many governments around the world deny their people.
It is that economic freedom thatensures that hard work pays off and gives people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their path in life.
Generations of canadian who trace their roots around the world have built Canada into thegreatest country, the true north, strong and free.
 [voice of interpreter] in order to ensure we remain free, we must continueto fight efforts that infringe on our freedoms.
Minority rights must be protected.
Religious freedoms must be protected.
Freedom of expression and the right to protest peacefully mustbe protected.
[end of translation] in order to ensure that we as a people remain free, we must fight efforts to infringe on these rights, including racism and injustice in Canada and around the world.
Minority rights must be protected.
Religious freedoms must be protected.
Freedom of expression and the right to protest must be protected.
As john diefenbaker said, free to stand for what I believe right, free to oppose what I think wrong, free to choose those to govern this country.
I pledge to uphold this for myself and all of mankind.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
[applause].



The honourable member for beloeil-chambly.



[voice of interpreter] thank you very much.
George Floyd is not a victim of racism, but another victim of racism.
At a time of crisis when contempt causes us to be afraid of disease, for thousands of people who are taking to the streets to express their outrage, here in the political sphere we're going to have to be cautious once again in terms of the words we choose because we're particularly given to interpreting the words of others.
Today our duty is to express our solidarity and our sadness, our indignation, our anger, but also, and most importantly, I would say from the wonderful black community in Quebec, our friendship.
We have to try to be heard by all humans.
Every time we talk about this, there's a part of me that comes out, the kind of unofficial anthropologist that I AM reminds me that racists don't exist.
There are certain genetic traits that manifest themselves that create cultures.
Racism expresses first and foremost through the aggression of what we presume to be the culture of others, differences.
Differences that all too often, when they frighten others, are too many.
We have to learn to live equally, fairly, in our diversity, which in itself is something extraordinary.
Governments in the United States have all been racist.
Racism was obviously expressed through their history and in their institutions.
This has left a trace.
This is the only thing we can call systemic racism and systemic discrimination.
I'm concerned that anyone who suggests that we're all collectively enrolled in systemic discrimination or anyone who thinks that they are virtuous barrier between ourselves and the victim, I don't think the Canadian government is racist, the quebecgovernment is racist, I don't think our municipalities are racist either, but there can be traces of odious things in our institutions.
These taint our relationships with people who are of various origins or people who have been here before us. So systemic racism does probablyexist.
We can't point out people, but we have to review our view of what can be discriminatory.
Today belongs to George Floyd.
Today belongs to blacks in the United States today belongs to blacks in Quebec and Canada.
We're not going to do politics at the door of a funeral.
We are going to allow the indignation in the United States itself and we'll allow those who need to speak to speak with one voice with peace.
All those who are peaceful are legitimate.
Nothing that is violent is legitimate.
The Prime Minister announced his desire for concrete measures to fight racism.
The first measure should be to show our solidarity and friendship.
I would propose as a priority to quickly process files for asylum-seekers, particularly here from black individuals and people of other origins as well who express their desire to participate in the Quebec nation.
We have the power and the duty to do so and let's do it tomorrow.
Let's do it right away.
But we'll be able to put our work into action.
This will make us more credible.
In the meantime, our duty is to stand up for those who are afraid, stand up against those who are making them afraid.
Thank you, chair.
[applause].



The honourable member for Barnaby south.



[voice of interpreter] thank you, Mr. Chair.
Many Canadians were shaken to see the violence due to the murder of George Floyd.
The murder of George Floyd reminds us that racism, anti-black racism, is still verypresent and hits hard.
Anti-black racism is not only present in the United States it is present here as well.
Systemic racism to blacks, indigenous peoples, and other visible minorities is present, racial profiling, economic inequalities, social inequalities, hiring discrimination -- [end of translation].



Now we will hear from the Minister of innovation.



Good afternoon.
From the very beginning --



[voice of interpreter] -- into action and into justice.
We have to do more than just calling for peace.
I think we have to call for justice.
Justice is the only path to creating a better world.
[end of translation] when people around the world saw the killing of George Floyd, it left all of us shaken to our core.
It was chilling.
The casual violence of anti-black racism, the callous taking of another human being's life.
It hurt to the core.
There was pain, there was sadness, and rightly so, there is anger.
There is frustration.
This isn't just an american problem.
This is just as much a canadian problem as well and something that continues to exist across this country.
Anti-black racism, anti-indigenous racism is real.
Black people and indigenous people have suffered violence and have been killed at the hands of police here in Canada.
I think about regis paquet in toronto and the calls for justice for regis.
a trans black woman who was killed in suspicious circumstances in an interaction with the police.
I think about stewart kevin andrews, a young indigenous man killed in an interaction with the police in winnipeg.
The anger and the frustration ishow many more people need to diebefore there's action? how many more speeches will be made? how many more protests need to happen before something is done.
How many more times will people plead to breathe? how many more times will they plead to live? what we're talking about is basic human dignity.
How many more voices have to ask, demand, plead, beg for basic human dignity? people are angry.
They're feeling like enough is enough.
Why do they need to keep on asking? why do black people, why do indigenous people need to keep asking to be treated like a human? why? you know what, people are done with pretty speeches, particularly pretty speeches from people in power that could do something about it right now if they wanted to. I'm standing in the hall of power, the chamber of commons, with a Prime Minister who has the power to not just say prettywords, to actually do something about this.
The Prime Minister of this country has the power to go beyond pretty words and pretty speeches and do something.
Now, I don't have all the answers.
I don't think any one person does.
We're going to have to come up with those solutions together, but there's certainly some things we do know.
Martin luther king said peace isnot merely the absence of tension.
Peace is the presence of justice.
That's what we need.
We need justice.
People should plan, plot, strategize, organize, and then mobilize.
Cardib.
Put it this way, anotherway to take power is by voting.
What do we vote for? we vote for a government to takeaction.
I call on the Prime Minister in this hall of power.
If the Prime Minister believes black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending racial profiling in our country? [applause].



**The Hon. Jagmeet Singh**:

If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over policing of black bodies? if the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over incarceration of black people in this country? now, if the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will he commit to ensuring there is race-based data to make better decisions, will he make sure there is better access to education and health resources.
The Prime Minister has access todo these things.
He needs to get it done.
If the Prime Minister believes that indigenous lives matter, heneeds to end the profiling of indigenous people, the over policing, and the over incarceration of indigenous people.
If the Prime Minister believes indigenous lives matter, the Prime Minister can stop taking indigenous kids to court, he canstop delaying the action on the the calls for justice on the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.
If the Prime Minister believes indigenous lives matter, he can make sure there's access to clean drinking water, education, and housing right now for indigenous people.
People are angry because they'redone with pretty words and pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now.
People don't want peace.
They don't want an absence of tension.
People want the presence of justice.
People want justice.
People deserve justice.
People need justice.
Justice is what people will get.
Nothing less will do. Thank you.
[applause].



**Rosemary**:

Those are statements from leaders inside the house as they respond to the protests -- the anti-racism protests we've seen in this country in the United States



> let's go now to the briefing in Ottawa where cabinet ministers and public health officials are going to take questions.
We've arrived just in time for that.
Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland.



My own experience in government.
I cannot say that every single question I AM asked by a journalist is welcome or easy toanswer.
But I AM absolutely convinced that the fact that journalists are present to bear witness, the fact that journalists are present to hold governments to account makes governments better.
Freedom of the press is an essential human right and it is an essential element in making democracy strong.



[voice of interpreter] in french now please, deputy Prime Minister.



**Answer**:

That is a very good question.
As a journalist and a politiciantoday, I've reflected a great deal on this issue.
I must say as a politician I cannot say that I warmly welcome every single question that I receive.
There are difficult questions obviously, however, I can say that I'm more persuaded now than ever at having strong journalism and freedom of the press is essential for democracy.
Because of the presence of journalists to bear witness to what is happening, who are present and have the power to ask questions of the government, every democracy, including ours, is stronger.
Journalists and journalism are essential for democracy.
Thank you.
[end of translation].

**Question**:

and this question is for Minister anand.
The government has ordered close to 40, 000 ventilators, but only 203 have arrived, a number that's remained the same for weeks now.
is there a problem.
and in terms of n95 masks, millions have been directed outside of the health care system.
Where are they being redirected and are you allowing the resale of them to the public?



**Answer**:

Thank you so much for those two questions.
The first question relating to ventilators is a good one.
You're right, we have received just over 200 ventilators.
The contracts that we have in place for a large portion of the remainder are in place with Canadian manufacturers, as both Minister Bains and I have discussed at these pressers in the past.
They will be arriving over the next month as these companies, some of which are retooling, some of which are starting up todo the ventilator production are doing just that.
So you will see the numbers of ventilators on our chart, on ourwebsite, increasing over the next month.
I will say that those ventilatorprocurements are in addition to the existing stock of ventilators that the public health agency of Canada has.
Of course provinces and individual health care systems are making their own procurement's across a range of P.P.E. and other equipment as well.
On the kn 95 masks, 2 million have been made available.
We are still in the middle of the crisis especially from a procurement perspective.
All of our procurements at the current time are based on federal and provincial orders that have come into us for delivery out to the health care system.
There is a demand for P.P.E. Outside of the health care system.
We are currently devising a means by which we can be more broad based in terms of suppliesand use of P.P.E. Across Canada.
Thank you so much.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



**Operator**:

[voice of interpreter] question from Le devoir."

---

**Question**:

Mr. Bains, this question is for you.
You've announced the composition of your industry strategy council.
Just a moment, please.
Now, on the industry strategy council, that will help you to consider future perspectives, but what about workers? are they not part of the industrial strategy? are they just going to be subject to the implementation of these strategies? hello? hello?



Yes, he is answering now.



**Answer**:

Thank you for your questions.
The council's objective is clear.
We must have a strategy that can help the situation for workers, an improvement.
It's not just about the sectors.
It's about the workers.
Our strategy is an opportunity to have conversations with workers as well.
That is why we've mobilized leaders of every industry that can propose solutions for workers.

---

**Question**:

The workers, you don't want to hear from them? there's no union, there's no workers' group represented on your council.



**Answer**:

Once again, the council represents the industry and the private sector.
The private sector creates the right atmosphere for workers.
We will mobilize workers through unions in Canada, absolutely, yes.
I will work with My colleagues at cabinet as well.
We will engage unions throughoutcanada.



Thank you, Minister.
Operator, next question, please.
[end of translation].



**Operator**:

The next question is from Alex bell from the Toronto star." please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Hi. Thank you so much for taking My question.
Just on the syringe order, when will these syringes start arriving? just the second part of that fordr.
Tam, if I can.
Do you think that in order for vaccine to be effective that it needs to be mandatory that we have 37 million syringes coming in, that all of Canada must be vaccinated when this arrives?



**Answer**:

Thank you so much, Alex, for that question.
The contract for the syringes ISS new contract.
The delivery schedule is still being determined.
I will say that we are planning ahead for the eventual discovery of a vaccine.
So the need for those syringes at this very moment is not as high as we are seeing across other P.P.E. Items.
Having said that, we are workingto procure supplies, including those syringes, and other supplies that would be needed for the eventual discovery of a vaccine and it's administration throughout Canada.
But for the health aspect of that, I'll turn it over tr Dr. Tam, who may have more to say on vaccine administration.



So I think we don't know that we need to plan ahead for that eventuality.
We have a committee, the national advisory committee on immunization, that will be looking at the framework for prioritizing the provision of vaccine to Canadians.
There's no requirement or mandatory policy from the perspective of the federal government.
It is not something that we've provided, even in, for example, the last pandemic of 2009.
We do account for the maximum number of Canadians who may wish to be vaccinated.



Alex, follow up.

---

**Question**:

Yeah, just moving to the -- I guess this is for Minister Bains, the rapid testing kits.
Obviously there was a hope from getting some from the Ottawa company, spartan, I think recently that kind of fell through.
When will we see or when can we expect to see rapid testing kits in use in Canada with these new research agreements?



**Answer**:

Thank you very much for your question.
When it comes to testing, we know that it's important for the restart of the economy to ramp up our testing.
We know that meeting canadian's solutions for proper swabs and serology.
What I announced today are low-cost point-of-care diagnostic testing kits.
These will be used for clinics, airports, particularly for ruraland remote communities.
The objective is to get quick, rapid test results.
This is early stages.
This is a prototype with a proofof concept that is going to be developed.
It still needs to be approved byhealth Canada.
So this is a bit of a long-term play.
It is not something that will beup and running in the next few weeks.
It will take months.
The other thing is to complementthe other testing initiatives as well and really to mobilize our innovators across the country who are highly skilled at comingup with different solutions.
This is a byproduct of a challenge that we put out to industry to come up with new solutions.
Looking at saliva-based solutions which is easier.
We need to go through the due diligence particularly with health Canada to make sure we have the appropriate setup in place for clinics, for airports, for rural and remote communities.
This is a longer-term play.

**Question**:

The Prime Minister has mentioned and Minister Duclos even mentioned in his remarks that we should be better allies for black Canadians.
I think that many black Canadians and activists would agree that being a good ally means calling out people for what they perceive as injustice.
Why has the government not been more forceful in its rep reprimand of president trump's dealing with protesters and his calling in of the army to deal with protesters.



**Answer**:

Thank you for that question.
It's a really important one.
I would like to start by being very clear that racism exists here in Canada.
As we heard jean-yves say a moment ago, systemic racism is real.
Anti-black racism is real.
and unconscious bias is real.
As a canadian politician, as a canadian leader, My focus is on Canada and it is on being clear with our government and with Canadians that this is not a problem to which we are immune.
It is a problem here in Canada.
It is our job today to listen tocanadians, to listen to black Canadians, and it's time for us to act.

---

**Question**:

I must note in the questions previous and the answer the Prime Minister gave and the response you gave here, you haven't mentioned president trump by name.
Are you concerned about blow back from the United States if we are to get involved in an issue like this?



**Answer**:

What I AM concerned about actually is Canadian complacency.
It's important for us to set our own house in order and for us to be aware of the pain that anti-black racism causes in our own country, of the reality thatwe do have systemic discrimination here in Canada.
I think that we as Canadians, all of us, need to take this very traumatic moment for many people in the world as an opportunity to look at what we are doing in Canada and to work hard to do better.



[voice of interpreter] thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Operator, one last question on the telephone, please.
[end of translation].



**Operator**:

Our next question is from "la presse."

---

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] thank you very much.
Hello to all.
My question is for ms. Freeland having to do with the United States.
Over the last few days, have you had any conversations with an American counterpart, such as Mr. Pompeo, in order to express Canada's concerns about what's happening south of the border?



**Answer**:

I did have dialogue with an American counterpart in the last few days.
However, we discussed concerns about international trade.
and free trade.
It was a very specific conversation.
[end of translation] we're in constant touch with our americanpartners.
I very specifically have some communication with American counterparts very specifically about trade issues.



[voice of interpreter] Melanie, a follow up?

---

**Question**:

Yes.
Ms. Freeland, as a follow up, I would like to ask about the laser operation in Quebec's nursing homes.
Has an agreement been established between the federal government and the province of Quebec?



**Answer**:

That's a very important question.
I would like to start by saying just how much I appreciate the vast amount of work that the women and men of the Canadian forces have put in. I AM proud of them.
I think all Canadians should thank the Canadian armed forces for what they are doing.
I think we can say that we are talking about saving Canadians' lives here.
As you know, we are discussing with Ontario and Quebec to determine how much more time thecanadian forces will remain in place.
The Prime Minister was clear that this is not a long-term solution.
We must find solution s solutio because the canadian forces cannot stay there for ever.
We are working on resolving the situation with the provinces.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
We have time for one last question.



**Operator**:

Question from "the Canadian press."

---

**Question**:

Hello to all of you.
My question is for Minister an and and perhaps Minister Bains.
You would like Canadians to be self sufficient when it comes to personal protective equipment.
is Canada following the trajectory that was initially drawn? are we still going to need to import materials from other countries, such as china?



**Answer**:

I would like to start and then give the floor to Minister Bains.
We have a constant flow of goods coming from various sources, both nationally and internationally, in order to maintain the supply chain.
We have contracts with national and international suppliers.
We need to prioritize the maintain of -- maintenance of this equipment for Canadians.
That is important in the short and the long term.
We are being aggressive and proactive in our approach for Canadians.
Navy.



Thank you, Anita.
I agree with My colleague.
We will continue to manufacture essential equipment.
For instance, we have 700 businesses throughout Canada who are manufacturing essential equipment for Canadians.
I AM sure that our capacity will continue to grow.
[end of translation].



**Rosemary**:

We're going to pull away from this federal briefing that is wrapping up. I will wrap up with My colleagues Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
The bit that stood out for me as a potentially encouraging, although in no way anything concrete behind it, the idea that Canada is working to procure 37 million syringes if there is a vaccine one day so we can all get it was a bright light in an otherwise not the best day in terms of what people were having to talk about and deal with, which was primarily speeches around anti-black racism or racism, both in this country and the United States.
That's where we started things off inside the house of commons with speeches from all leaders, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Speeches from all leaders.
I found one specific point echoed through all of them, that was to again not be in denial, that this is only a problem in the United States, but it does exist here in Canada.
There were slight variances in the approach.
At the end of the day there were some pushes, for example, from NDP Leader, jag meet Singh, to see more concrete action in that vein and promises from the Prime Minister to take more concrete action.
It's to follow up in the days and weeks to come.
That's where I would be looking.
It was interesting to see a question to the deputy Prime Minister follow up on a question to the Prime Minister from our colleague tom Perry, in which he paused for 20 seconds and then answered about what happened in the United States.
There was a hesitancy in the answer from Chrystia Freeland.
She answered in very much a similar way as the Prime Minister and did not really acknowledge the actions of the president, but said My interpretation of My job is to focus on what's happening here in Canada and the idea that we don't deny the existence of racism is here and we have to fight it. She did not address the actions taken by the president.
She did pause a little bit, just not as long as the Prime Minister.



**Rosemary**:

The line that stood out from me from the Prime Minister was, I'm sure the last thing you want to hear is another speech from a white politician.
That's probably true, but he wanted to say something because his government wants to listen and understands the anger.
Of course jag meet Singh is the first leader of any political party who is a person of colour.
His speech was a little bit different.
It was certainly more emotional, given some of the lived experiences he's had.
I thought he made some interesting points calling on the Prime Minister for action.
Generally there are speeches where you talk about your thoughts and opinions, but he demanded some action from the government, David.



**David**:

I thought jag meet singh's speech was the most personal and probably the most powerful of the speeches, raising the specific questions of how many more people will have to ask to be allowed to breathe and live, what will it take for people to take action.
I'm tired of pretty speeches and want concrete action.
That's what we're seeing south of the border in the United States.
I think it's encouraging to see that conversation taking place in the house of commons.
The challenge, I suppose, is whether that conversation extends beyond the scripted and well-timed, and well-thought-outand written speeches of today and does it move into actual concrete action that makes a difference in the live of racialized Canadians.
That's the challenge and the test that all the leaders are laying out for themselves in their speeches today.
As jagmeet singh said, it's going to take more than a prettyspeech to have any kind of a meaningful effect.
It was too, I picked up on the same thing as Vassy, when the deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, was asked to comment on the United States, she said as a canadian politician, My focus is Canada.
She is the Minister of foreign affairs and also for Canada-United States relations, she has a lt of things to enforce on that aren'tjust internal.
It was interesting with the Prime Minister, the deputy Prime Minister, and the speeches, the government wants to speak broadly on the issue of race andnot specifically on the actions of the United States government, in particular the president.
They want to look inward at issues in Canada, things they can control, and not get into a contest to be the loudest voice condemning the actions of our neighbour to the south.
They are in a difficult spot.
Trade is happening.
Essential medical supplies are coming from the United States.
That border is closed right now, but it is still a lifeline in this pandemic.
Very difficult for them to satisfy the political urges of people who want them to say tough things about donald trump and still maintain the relationsthey need to keep the supplies coming.



**Rosemary**:

Maybe our own personal urges to say tough things about Donald trump that in a political environment becomes more difficult.
Thank you for your coverage, Vassy kapelos, later on "power & politics," and David Cochrane, wherever he may turn up today.
Wrapping up our coverage today, much of the focus today by the government, the Prime Minister says they're watching with horror and consternation what is happening in the United States I'm rosemary Barton.
Andrew Nichols picks up our coverage.
Thanks for watching.
See you tomorrow
