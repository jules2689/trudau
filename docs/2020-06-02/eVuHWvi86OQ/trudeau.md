# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I will be in the house of commons to speak about what know is on a lot of Canadians' minds.
For now I want to address the role that us leaders have to apply.
We need to fight racism, discrimination, and injustice.
Being an ally is taking a hard look at our existing systems and being committed to doing the necessary work to fix them.
Our government is ready to take action.
 

[voice of interpreter] this is the result of systems and not only on the other side of the border, but here in Canada, in our communities, and in our own country.
This has to stop.
People who have never been subject to discrimination or racism have a very important role to play in all of this.
We have a responsibility.
We have a responsibility to recognize the injustice in our lives and to take concrete action that reflects our solidarity toward other citizens.


[end of translation] as we move through this pandemic, I know a lot of Canadians are wondering when their community will be able to get back up and running.
The short answer is it depends on where you live and how things are going for your city or region.
That's why every province and territory has their own plan to restart.
As I said yesterday, defeating COVID-19 is something we must dotogether.
Our government knows that, which is why I've been collaborating with the premiers on a shared approach moving forward.
Yesterday we took a first step with some funding for municipalities.
Of course help for cities and towns is just one piece of the puzzle.
We know that provinces and territories also need secure on securing personal protective equipment and other vital supplies.
Here too we're stepping up. Since day one, our government has been working around the clock to secure vital P.P.E. Just take the fact that we've received more than 100 million surgical masks and nearly 40 million gloves and are continuing to send a whole rangeof supplies to the provinces andterritories.
Or that we've signed a contract for millions of syringes to havethe supplies needed when a vaccine is ready.
Working with suppliers from around the world is key to keeping Canadians safe.
At the end of the day, one of the best ways to ensure we have what we need is to make it righthere at home.
Our government has been working with canadian manufacturers to make that happen.
Over half of our face shields were produced in Canada.
Working with companies like canadian shield retooled to makeadvisors.
They went from 10 employees to 200.
That is a win-win.
We support good jobs for Canadians.
The same goes for testing.
We're now funding four companies working on breakthrough systems.
Deep biologic in Guelph, nicoiasystems in Edmonton and a company in kelowna.
We are including precision biomonitoring, who are setting up a testing kit site in Ontario.
Demand for supplies will go up and Canada must be able to keep up. So whether it's n95 masks or I. C.u. Equipment, we will continue our work with the provinces and territories on thesupplies we need going forward.
 

[voice of interpreter] whether it is to secure individual protective equipment or to support municipalities, we will continueto work with the premiers of theprovinces and territories to ensure that everyone is safe.
We have already distributed hundreds of thousands of items to front-line workers and that began when this crisis erupted.
One of the best ways of ensuringwe have the equipment we need isto make Ito right here at home.
In recent months we have made targeted investments to increaseour production capacity.
Today almost half of our facial shields are being manufactured in Canada.
We've also made progress on testing.
We are now funding four canadianbusinesses whose work could allow us to make a major breakthrough when it comes to rapid testing for COVID-19. We're also supporting the business precision biomonitoringin Ontario, which is setting up a plant that will produce test kits.
We're moving in the right direction, but we must do more.
With the economic recovery, the demand for these types of products will increase.
That's normal.
So we will continue to work withthe provinces and territories to ensure they have enough personalprotective equipment.


[end of translation] to support canadian jobs, to restart the economy, we have to work together.
It's not just as governments, but across sectors too.
Last month we set up the industry strategy council, led by Minister Bains and chaired bymonique leroux, they are taking a deeper dive into the challenges and stressors industry is facing.
Today Minister Bains announced nine business leaders that each represent a different plaure of our economy.
They will meet and discuss regular as we plan our path forward.
 

[voice of interpreter] since this crisis began, we have noted just how important support and solidarityare and that does not only applyto the pandemic.
There are so many issues around the world that cannot be resolved by a single government or country.
I'm thinking about the fight against climate change, for example.
That is a priority for our government and we will continue to take action to protect the future of our children and our planet.
But we cannot do that alone.
The good news is that we do not have to do it alone.
For example, the alliance powering past coal, which bringstogether more than 100 members around the world is doing an amazing job to improve the quality of our air.
Now, the alliance earlier founded by Canada and the united kingdom will be I don't understanding its new members, including the desjardins movement.
It will become the first north american institution to join that alliance.
Canadians are showing the path forward.
Our government will be there to support this initiative.


[end of translation] I want to end by recognizing today is the perfect day to wish everyone a happy italian heritage month.
For generations italians have made our country a stronger and better place.
It comes as no surprise that this community is stepping up tohelp.
Maybe you've been taking groceries over to an elderly neighbour or maybe you were one of many who helped raise $1 million for the italian red cross.
However you're lending a hand, thank you.
It just goes to show that we arestronger together.
 

[voice of interpreter] the values that embody the italian community, hard work, family, generosity, are important to all of us. Today and every single day, we recognize the many ways this community contributes to our country and to our lives.
Happy italian heritage month.
Thank you.
