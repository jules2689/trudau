### Summary:


Being an ally is taking a hard look at our existing systems and being committed to doing the necessary work to fix them.
Our government is ready to take action.
 

[voice of interpreter] this is the result of systems and not only on the other side of the border, but here in Canada, in our communities, and in our own country.
We have a responsibility to recognize the injustice in our lives and to take concrete action that reflects our solidarity toward other citizens.


[end of translation] as we move through this pandemic, I know a lot of Canadians are wondering when their community will be able to get back up and running.
Our government knows that, which is why I've been collaborating with the premiers on a shared approach moving forward.
Yesterday we took a first step with some funding for municipalities.
We know that provinces and territories also need secure on securing personal protective equipment and other vital supplies. Since day one, our government has been working around the clock to secure vital P.P.E. Just take the fact that we've received more than 100 million surgical masks and nearly 40 million gloves and are continuing to send a whole rangeof supplies to the provinces andterritories.
Working with suppliers from around the world is key to keeping Canadians safe.
Our government has been working with canadian manufacturers to make that happen.
Working with companies like canadian shield retooled to makeadvisors.
We're now funding four companies working on breakthrough systems. Equipment, we will continue our work with the provinces and territories on thesupplies we need going forward.
 

[voice of interpreter] whether it is to secure individual protective equipment or to support municipalities, we will continueto work with the premiers of theprovinces and territories to ensure that everyone is safe.
We have already distributed hundreds of thousands of items to front-line workers and that began when this crisis erupted.
We are now funding four canadianbusinesses whose work could allow us to make a major breakthrough when it comes to rapid testing for COVID-19. We're also supporting the business precision biomonitoringin Ontario, which is setting up a plant that will produce test kits.
So we will continue to work withthe provinces and territories to ensure they have enough personalprotective equipment.


[end of translation] to support canadian jobs, to restart the economy, we have to work together.
Last month we set up the industry strategy council, led by Minister Bains and chaired bymonique leroux, they are taking a deeper dive into the challenges and stressors industry is facing.
 

[voice of interpreter] since this crisis began, we have noted just how important support and solidarityare and that does not only applyto the pandemic.
That is a priority for our government and we will continue to take action to protect the future of our children and our planet.
Our government will be there to support this initiative.


[end of translation] I want to end by recognizing today is the perfect day to wish everyone a happy italian heritage month.
Maybe you've been taking groceries over to an elderly neighbour or maybe you were one of many who helped raise $1 million for the italian red cross.
 

[voice of interpreter] the values that embody the italian community, hard work, family, generosity, are important to all of us. Today and every single day, we recognize the many ways this community contributes to our country and to our lives.
