### Summary:



We will extend by 30 days the current measures along the border.
 

[voice of interpreter] this morning I can confirm that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by 30 days the measures currently in place at the border.
As we honour her, we pay tribute to the bravery of all those who served today.
So to everyone who so proudly wears the maple leaf, thank you, you do your country proud, today and every day.
 

[voice of interpreter] in the wake of the tragic crash of a plane of the royal Canadian air force over the weekend, Canadians stand with the family of captain Casey, captain macdougall, and the entire snowbirds team.


[end of translation] as we start to carefully and gradually reopen our economy, a lot of people will be wondering what that means for them.
This is about getting people back to work and giving businesses the confidence to reopen, rehire, and even grow.
Because the way our economy will recover and the way our country will remain resilient and successful is by getting Canadians back to work.
Many business owners are alreadybenefitting from this program to rehire and maintain the crucial link between workplace and employee.
To employers looking to start upagain, please rehire your workers, use the wage subsidy for their paycheque.
For businesses that still need help, today we're taking another step forward.
Today I can announce that we are expanding the eligibility of thecanada emergency business account.
If you are the sole owner/operator of a business, ifyour business relies on contractors, or if you have a family-owned business and you pay employees through dividends, you will now qualify.
For example, for a hair salon owner with stylists who rent chairs, for a local physiotherapist, for an independent gym owner with contracted trainers, this is foryou.
That's why Minister ng is also working on potential solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate through their personal bank account as opposed to a businessbank account or have yet to filea tax return, such as newly created businesses.
Businesses like yours are the backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities.
 

[voice of interpreter] in order to help small business owners cover their expenses, we are expandingeligibility for the Canada emergency business account.
Already more than 6, 000 small businesses have received a $40, 000 loan under this program, but we know that there are more people out there who need help.
So if you are the only owner andemployee of a business, if your business depends on contract workers, or if your business is a family-owned business and you pay employees with dividends, you will also be eligible.
For example, if you have a hair salon where your stylists rent their chairs or you're a self-employed physiotherapist orthe owner of a gym that employees contract trainers, theprogram will be there for you.
We are working hard so people can keep their jobs or return towork, and we're doing that by helping small businesses that are so important in our communities, because that is howcanada can fire up again.


[end of translation] and now some good news that we haven't had enough of today.
