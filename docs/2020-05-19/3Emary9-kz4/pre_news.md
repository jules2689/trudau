# News before the Speech







**Rosemary**:

Hello there.
I'm rosemary Barton here in Ottawa.
Thank you petitioner joining us on CBC news network and streaming online and on our app.
We are standing by for Prime Minister trudeau's address, the first since there was a snowbirds plane crash that killed Jenna Casey and injured the pilot, Richard macdougall.
We are expecting the Prime Minister to address that crash and also expecting an update on the government's response to thepandemic, more information about the Canada emergency business account, on a day when three more provinces are lifting some restrictions and allowing the restrictions to be lifted, here, Ontario, as well as British Columbia.
The Prime Minister will participate virtually in the COVID-19 committee in parliament.
So he starts his briefing a little bit earlier on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
While we wait I'll bring in My colleagues, the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos, and David Cochrane.
Vassy, we are expecting the Prime Minister to talk about these small business loans.
605 businesses have applied for those loans so far.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, he's going to talk about those loans and the main criticism is the people who have been unable to qualify.
If you don't have a payroll between $20, 000 and $1.5 million, if you pay yourself in dividends or you have contract workers, those are ineligible.



**Rosemary**:

Thanks, Vassy.
Here is the Prime Minister of Canada.
