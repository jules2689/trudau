# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We will extend by 30 days the current measures along the border.
This is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe.
 

[voice of interpreter] this morning I can confirm that Canada and the United States have agreed to extend by 30 days the measures currently in place at the border.
This is an important decision which will protect its citizens on both sides of the border.


[end of translation] I also want to address the tragic RAF plane crash in kamloops over the weekend.
Our thoughts are with captain Casey, captain macdougall, and the entire snowbirds team.
This has been a difficult few weeks for members of the Canadian armed forces.
As we mourn, we remember captaincasey as an outstanding journalist woman, a journalist who turned her talents to the forces.
She will be remembered for her professionalism, sense of humour, and kindness.
As we honour her, we pay tribute to the bravery of all those who served today.
Our men and women in uniform are always there for us, serving overseas to defend the values we hold dear, working here at home to care for seniors and lift our spirits with flyovers.
So to everyone who so proudly wears the maple leaf, thank you, you do your country proud, today and every day.
 

[voice of interpreter] in the wake of the tragic crash of a plane of the royal Canadian air force over the weekend, Canadians stand with the family of captain Casey, captain macdougall, and the entire snowbirds team.
As we mourn the death of anotherheroine, we pay tribute to all of those who serve our country.
Every day you make us proud.


[end of translation] as we start to carefully and gradually reopen our economy, a lot of people will be wondering what that means for them.
If you've been laid off, you're probably waiting to see if your employer will start up your workplace and rehire you.
To help them do that, we've extended the wage subsidy through the summer.
This is about getting people back to work and giving businesses the confidence to reopen, rehire, and even grow.
Because the way our economy will recover and the way our country will remain resilient and successful is by getting Canadians back to work.
Many business owners are alreadybenefitting from this program to rehire and maintain the crucial link between workplace and employee.
To employers looking to start upagain, please rehire your workers, use the wage subsidy for their paycheque.
That's what it's there for.
For businesses that still need help, today we're taking another step forward.
Today I can announce that we are expanding the eligibility of thecanada emergency business account.
If you are the sole owner/operator of a business, ifyour business relies on contractors, or if you have a family-owned business and you pay employees through dividends, you will now qualify.
For example, for a hair salon owner with stylists who rent chairs, for a local physiotherapist, for an independent gym owner with contracted trainers, this is foryou.
We will have more details very soon about when you'll be able to apply, but we heard you when you said you needed a hand.
That's why Minister ng is also working on potential solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate through their personal bank account as opposed to a businessbank account or have yet to filea tax return, such as newly created businesses.
As we announced last week, thereis new funding for regional development agencies too that you can contact if you don't meet these expanded criteria.
Businesses like yours are the backbone of our economy and the lifeblood of our communities.
Whether it's with the ceba or the expanded wage subsidy, we'rein your corner.
 

[voice of interpreter] in order to help small business owners cover their expenses, we are expandingeligibility for the Canada emergency business account.
Already more than 6, 000 small businesses have received a $40, 000 loan under this program, but we know that there are more people out there who need help.
So if you are the only owner andemployee of a business, if your business depends on contract workers, or if your business is a family-owned business and you pay employees with dividends, you will also be eligible.
For example, if you have a hair salon where your stylists rent their chairs or you're a self-employed physiotherapist orthe owner of a gym that employees contract trainers, theprogram will be there for you.
We are working hard so people can keep their jobs or return towork, and we're doing that by helping small businesses that are so important in our communities, because that is howcanada can fire up again.
Of course so that we can get through this crisis, we also have to have enough medical material and personal protectiveequipment so that people can stay healthy and safe.
This morning I'd like to update Canadians on personal protectiveequipment.
In recent weeks, we have doubledour inventory of surgical masks and face shields.
This week and in the coming weeks, hundreds of thousands of hospital gowns, face shields, glasses, and swabs will be delivered to the provinces and territories.
We have also received an order of ventilators from zol in the United States.
Because we want that equipment to be produced here in Canada asmuch as possible, we continue toincrease our production capacity.
We now have 15 contracts right across the country to manufacture hospital gowns.
In fact, we will start receivinghospital gowns from the montrealcompany samuelson between now and the end of the month.


[end of translation] and now some good news that we haven't had enough of today.
As of today Canada now has its first university in the north.
Yukon college is becoming the new Yukon university.
As a cornerstone for this step, our government has already provided $26 million for a new science building.
To everyone who helped make thismilestone happen, congratulations, not just for students, but for all of us. This is truly something that celebrate.
Young people have the power to change our country for the better, and it's up to us to make sure that no matter where they live, they have the tools to chase their dreams and succeed.
Today, more than ever, we need their vision and their creativity because that is our path forward.
Merci.beaucoup.
