# Q & A

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] first of all, a question about the border.
Was there more pressure from the provinces to maintain the closure of the border until June? and is it the same thing on the United States, maybe an indeterminate closure of the border?



**Answer**:

Well, we have had a lot of discussion with the provinces over the recent weeks and there is a current desire to keep measures in place at the border.
As you know, that is a source of vulnerability for all of us in terms of cases of COVID-19 coming into our country.
So we will extend the -- those measures and the Americans were completely open to doing that for a further 30 days.

**Question**:

Yes.
I would like you to comment on the reopening of businesses in Montreal.
Do you have any concerns about what's happening in Montreal? and are you comfortable with the idea of doing some shopping in Montreal?



**Answer**:

Well, yesterday I Hadar conversation with a number of small business owners in My riding over the internet, virtually of course, and what I heard from them are their concerns, but also their desire to re-engage and to gradually reopen their businesses.
So I know that some businesses on the island of montreal and right across the country will bemaking the right decisions, willbe very careful.
Of course there are many consumers out there, even if they would like to be able to help their local businesses to thrive, they have some concerns.
So this will have to be done very carefully to ensure that we can reopen the businesses safelyand gradually and I too would like to be able to go to variousbusinesses in the coming days, but it's very important to continue to follow public healthadvice and practice physical distancing.

**Question**:

On this news regarding the border extension, I'm wondering when exactly will Canada open its international borders and do you foresee further extensions to this border closure beyond June 30?



**Answer**:

As we've seen the decisions are very much week to week in this crisis.
The situation is changing rapidly and we are adjusting to what are the right measures for Canadians and getting that balance right to keep Canadians safe and restore the economic activity that we all rely on. We're going to keep making those decisions as time goes on. It was the right thing to further extend our closure of the Canada-United States border by 30 days to everyone other than essential goods and services.
We will be watching around the world and around us as we make decisions about next steps.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that the situation is changing very, very quickly and we have to makethe appropriate decisions depending on the circumstances.
Right now it's important to extend that agreement and the current restrictions at the border for a further 30 days, but 30 days from now of course we will have further discussionsand look at what else is happening around the world and what the situation is across Canada and make the decisions that are right for Canada and appropriate at that time.
At every step we have to make the right decisions depending onthe circumstances.

**Question**:

Just a quick question regarding the lee ff program.
It seems it was delayed since may.
When will this be unveiled and what's the hold up?



**Answer**:

We were pleased to announce the large employer emergency financing facility a number of days ago now.
We're continuing to work with industry and various partners tofine-tune the program so it is the right thing.
It is designed to be a learned of last resort for many big employers.
We know that many companies havegreater access to capital than small businesses, which is why we helped small businesses rightaway and very generously.
But large companies can access borrowed capital on capital markets around the world.
We hope they're going to be ableto do that.
If they're unable to, the leeff will be there to offer them support to lend them money to get through this COVID-19 situation.
We're continuing to work with them on making sure that it rolls out as quickly as possible.

**Question**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Thank you.
I'm wondering if you can tell us what your approach is going to be on keystone x. L. what, if anything, can you do if the democratic candidate is going to cancel the project?



**Answer**:

a couple of years before becoming Prime Minister, I went down to Washington to advocate for the keystone x. L. pipeline.
It has been a long position of mine that we need to get our resources to new markets safely and securely.
That's why I've always advocated for the keystone x. L pipeline.
We saw the previous democratic administration cancel it. and we will continue to work with whatever government gets elected in the United States to impress upon them how important Canada is as a secure and reliable source of energy they require even as we move forward to a different future.
French eds  [voice of interpreter] I have always defended the keystone x. L. project.
Two years before I was elected, I went to Washington to drive home the message that the United States needs the energy we produce.
Of course I will work with whatever government is elected to remind that administration that Canada is a safe and reliable source of the energy that they require.
But we will continue to show that we will move forward responsibly by working with our partners.

**Question**:

My question was what you will do going forward.
I want to pivot to parliament.
Andrew Scheer is calling for more in-person sittings.
What is your position on how or when parliament should return?



**Answer**:

I think, as with everything, we need to be cautious and responsible with how we reopen and restart all sectors of the Canadian economy.
We understand that it is extremely important to have a strong democracy and institutions, not in spite of the crisis, but because of the crisis.
That's why we've been very pleased with extremely effective virtual sittings, combined with in-person sittings over the lastweeks, that have allowed M.P.s across the country to participate in asking questions of the work parliament is doing.
My concern is as we reopen, if we reopen, with reduced numbers without virtual sittings, there will be many, many M.P.s from further parts of the country whowill be unable or unwilling to come to ottawa because of their families' safety.
Therefore, there will be parts of the country that won't be reflected in our democratic institutions.
We've put forward proposals thatcombine both virtual sittings and in-person sittings, continue the approach we have right now.
We look to good conversations with other parties on figuring out that right balance as we move forward safely in upholding the importance of our democracy.



Thank you.
Operator.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Now, what changes have been made to the arrangement between Canada and the United States? ?



**Answer**:

Well, for now we are continuing with the exact same agreement.
Of course there is still discussions underway to determine whether other changes are needed or any adjustments are needed, but for now it's the same agreement.



Follow up?

**Question**:

Yes.
There's a provision in that agreement that has to do with sending back asylum seekers.
is that still in there and do you intend to ask that that provision stay in place?



**Answer**:

Yes, we are continuing with the same measures that were in place for asylum seekers for the next 30 days.
Now, obviously this is a situation we have experienced for a number of times.
We've had irregular asylum seekers coming into Canada and we have been seeking some way to resolve that situation that reflects our values and principles as a country and also working in good faith with our southern partner.
We are continuing our discussions on that, but at every step of the way we will ensure we are abiding by our values and principles.

**Question**:

As provinces start to reopen, testing and tracing can become more important.
We understand that came up in our call with first ministers.
What have you offered the provinces and territories in terms of support on that and what more can you do?



**Answer**:

The federal government has put forward a proposal that recognizes that increased contact tracing and increased testing are going to be key to a reopened Canadian economy.
We need to make sure right across the country that we have a strong capacity to respond wherever there might be a resurgence or a flare-up of COVID-19, and that means having significant resources at the availability of all regions and provinces.
So the federal government has offered to invest in a national framework to lead the way on testing and contact tracing.
We are working with the provinces right now to ensure that it works for all of them, but we're going to be moving forward on ramping up massively our testing and our contact tracing.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that in a reopened economy, it will be extremely important to quickly respond if there's a resurgence of COVID-19 someplace in the country.
So the federal government has decided that there has to be a massive ramping up of our ability to test and also to trace contacts that might have been infected.
So we have offered to increase that capacity across the countryand we will be working with the provinces to ensure that that pan-canadian approach can take hold, but we know that that willbe absolutely critical in the days to come.

**Question**:

When things do start reopening, what kind of infrastructure do you see in terms of testing, tracing, and other things as well, what is it going to look like when we allownon-essential travel across the border?



**Answer**:

These are ongoing questions.
We've given ourselves another month until we have to have the answers to those questions on non-essential travel, but even now we know we need to do more to ensure travellers who are coming back from overseas or the United states, as Canadians, areproperly followed up on, are properly isolated, and don't become further vectors for the spread of COVID-19. We're working with the provincesto ensure that arrival into Canada even now, but certainly when we get to a point when non-essential travel picks up again in the coming months, I guess, we need to have strong measures in place and we are looking at those closely.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] radio-Canada.
I want to take you to the international scene.
There is a petition going aroundthat say that Canada is not worthy of a seat on the u. N. andsome Canadians have signed that, particularly with respect to indigenous issues and so on. Should Canada continue its campaign and do you think that that will weaken our chances?



**Answer**:

Well, I don't think there's any real division on that.
I think all Canadians want Canada to have a strong and reasonable voice on the international scene, and that's what we're always seeking to have.
The security council of the united nations is one means of ensuring that our values are shared and that we can push for more cooperation between countries and more multilateralism.
and we can do that with a seat at the u. N. security council, but it is one way of pursuing our engagement with the rest of the world and not an end in itself.
So with respect to people who disagree with our position on Venezuela, the dictator Mauro is illegitimate and is creating a humanitarian crisis in that country that is sending refugees fleeing to other countries in south America.
We will stand with our friends in south America and our allies there to seek a solution to this terrible crisis.
[end of translation] the u. N. security council seat is a means for Canada to continue its strong advocacy and presence for our values on the world stage.
We know that there is a lot of reflection that needs to be had on how to handle this COVID-19 crisis and how to bring forward a better world in the coming years.
I think when we reflect on the scale of this crisis, many people have compared it to what happened 75 years ago around world war ii. In the years following world warii, we created a range of multilateral and multinational institutions, like the I. M.f., the world bank, the breton woodsinstitutions, that helped the world over the following decadesdevelop tremendous prosperity and opportunity for people rightaround the world.
70, 75 years later we have another crisis that is comparable in scale to that second world war, and there have to be reflections on how we moveforward as a world, how we update and adjust our various multilateral institutions to better respond to the world we are becoming a part of now in a post-COVID-19 era.
Canada's voice is going to be really important as it was around the forming of the bretonwoods institutions, as we create better, more prosperous, fairer world for everyone.
Canada having a voice at the u. N. security council will allow us to continue to be at the heart of those discussions as we move forward as a planet.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] could you be a bit more specific on that in terms of the role Canada plays in the global fight against COVID-19 and have you used this as part of your campaign? and there are some Canadians that are saying that they don't agree.
There is no unanimity in Canada.
How do you respond to that?



**Answer**:

Well, we have managed the situation in Canada quite effectively, but we can learn from our neighbours and our allies around the world, including multilateral fora such as the g7, the g20, la frank phonier, the commonwealth, and other ones.
They are helpful in terms of our ability to understand and move forward safely.
Also, how we can work together on the next steps to defeat thisvirus.
At the same time, it's important to reflect on the fact that this crisis we are now in is often compared to the global crisis that occurred in world war ii and in the years following world war ii a number of international institutions were created to guide us in the coming decades.
They have worked very, very well when it comes to creating prosperity around the world.
Now we have an obligation to think on what changes and improvements to those institutions are now needed, so that we can move effectively towards the 21st century.
Canada should and must be part of those discussions, not only because we are managing to -- managing our economy quite well in the midst of this crisis and reflecting our values around theworld, but because the next steps when it comes to rebuilding a global economy and making a fair world a more prosperous world for all is something Canada can speak to with a strong voice.
That's precisely why we are seeking another means of making our strong voice heard in these international institutions.

**Question**:

Kevin Gallagher with CTV national news.
President Donald trump is threatening to pull American funding from the world health organization and reconsidering his country's membership in thatu.
N. agency.
Now, some European countries have come to the support of the W.H.O. Where does Canada stand?



**Answer**:

Canada believes that multilateral institutions like the W.H.O. Are extremely important, particularly at a time of a global health crisis like this one.
No global institution is perfect, and there are obviouslythings we need to work on and things we need to improve about multilateralism and that is one of the reasons Canada has been so active over the last weeks and months in this crisis to advocate for a rethinking and improvement of our global institutions and situations in line with our values.
We will continue to do that.
We will continue to support the W.H.O., even as we look for improvements to our multilateralsystems.

**Question**:

China has actually pledged $2 billion for the W.H.O. Obviously leading up to this theorganization has faced criticismfor its handling of misinformation at the beginning of this outbreak coming out of china.
So are there any concerns for you that there's such a large influence in the term of fundingcommitment from china to the W.H.O.?



**Answer**:

I think there are always going to be reflections about the relationships between the largest donors to multilateral institutions and the functioning of those multilateral institutions.
I think, as we move through this crisis and particularly come out of it, we will have to be asking questions about the independence and the strength of those organizations to be able to do the kinds of things that are absolutely necessary in keeping everyone around the world safe.
That balance does need to be looked at carefully.
There will be some real questions around china of course in the coming months and years that need to be answered, and we will be part of that.

**Question**:

Janet silver, global news.
Earlier in your opening remarks you commented on the snowbirds crash over the weekend.
Have you spoken to captain casey's family? have they expressed concerns about the snowbirds family and whether or not you think they should be grounded?



**Answer**:

I have had a couple of conversations over the last couple of days with the minister of defence, and I know he and others are closely engaged with the families.
I will of course be speaking to the family of captain Casey and others.
I think there are very good questions being asked by a whole lot of people about safety rightnow, first and foremost by the rcaf.
There is going to be a proper investigation and we're going to allow them to do their work before we make assumptions about what might be the outcome of that investigation.
 [voice of interpreter] I have spoken to the Minister of defence several times over the last weekend about this terrible tragedy, and of course I will be speaking to the families involved.
But for now, we need to allow the royal Canadian air force conduct the investigation as to how this accident could have occurred rather than jumping to the conclusions about the safety of those aircraft.
