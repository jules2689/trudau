# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Good morning.
I want to start by addressing the issue that's unfolding south of the border, which is also having an impact here at home.
For far too many Canadians the images and stories coming out of the United States are all too familiar.
As a country, we can't pretend that racism doesn't exist here.
Anti-black racism is real.
Unconscious bias is real, and systemic discrimination is real, and they happen here in Canada.
Over the weekend we saw thousands of people gather across the country to join peaceful protests against anti-black racism.
By standing together and denouncing the few who would tryto derail these demonstrations, Canadians are sending the message that they will never tolerate injustice.
The young black Canadians, I hear you when you say you are anxious and angry, when you say that this brings back painful experiences of racism that you've faced.
I want you to know that I AM listening and that your government will always stand with you.
Together we will keep taking meaningful action to fight racism and discrimination in every form.
The status quo where people faceviolence because of the colour of their skin is unacceptable.
No parent should have to once again explain to their kids thatthey or their friends might faceracism.
It is time, it is past time for this to change.
As leaders and allies, we must do the hard work needed to listen and learn.
We must ensure that everyone is safe and respected.
That includes journalists who need to be able to do their workon the front lines to expose thetruth and tell the stories we need to hear, and we must as Canadians always keep working together to build a fairer, better, more equitable country for all.
[voice of interpreter]for far too many Canadians, whatis happening on the other side of the border at this time is familiar to them.
Anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, injustice, they are also present in our country.
Over the weekend we saw thousands of people right acrossthe country demonstrating peacefully to stand up against racism by forming a common frontand denouncing those who always try to disrupt these demonstrations, Canadians are sending the message that they will not tolerate injustice.
So now I would like to speak directly to young black Canadians.
I hear you.
I hear your concern, your anger, your pain.
I hear you when you say that this brings back painful experiences of racism and discrimination.
I'm listening to you, and our government is there for you.
and we are taking action to combat racism and hate in all its forms.
The status quo where young people face violence because of the colour of their skin is unacceptable.
No parent should have to once again explain to their children that they or their friends couldface racism.
As leaders and allies, we have to ensure that everyone is safe and treated with respect.
Of course, that includes journalists, who must be able todo their work on the ground to expose the truth and tell the stories that we have to hear.
and as Canadians, we must continue to build a better country, a more equal and fairercountry for all.
[ end of interpretation ]it has been a very difficult spring for many people, and although the path forward won't be easy, things will get better.
Over the last month we've started to see promising signs that the curve is flattening in Canada.
Now the situation remains very serious, but the more we can control the spread of the virus, the more we can begin re-starting.
In many parts of the country, this is already happening.
In others, where the situation remains more uncertain, steps are being taken more slowly.
Every province and territory will have its own approach, but as we move forward with re-starting the economy, we mustkeep working together.
On Thursday, as part of our weekly call, I spoke to the premiers about collaboration on the path ahead.
I'm working closely with them, just like with mayors and other leaders, on what this approach should include, because there are a whole range of issues thatwill require us to take action together.
As I've said before, to keep Canadians safe, to give businesses the confidence to reopen their doors, and people the confidence to walk through those doors, we need to cooperate on country-wide testing and contact tracing.
On this front, we're making goodprogress.
At the same time, our governmentis ready to be a partner for theprovinces and territories in supporting vulnerable people, securing personal protective equipment, and working on child care, to name a few.
In other words, we're ready to be a partner in a safe, effective re-start of the economy.
and today we're demonstrating a first step forward with support for municipalities as they face a cash crunch.
From testing clinics to programsfor seniors, cities and towns provide essential services.
So it's crucial that they have the resources they need.
In response to COVID-19, we willmake available $2.2 billion for municipalities in the coming weeks through their yearly federal support with the gas taxfund.
Normally municipalities receive these payments in two instalments, but we know that cities and towns need this moneyright away as they deal with COVID-19. That's why we're making the full2020-21 payment available now.
Minister mckenna has sent letters to all of her provincialand territorial counterparts to outline how this accelerated process will work, but here's the bottom line.
This is strong support to keep Canadians safe and our communities strong.
and it's support that will give businesses the confidence to reopen, getting hard-working Canadians back on the job.
This is a start.
We know there's more to be done to support municipalities and tosupport the entire reopening process.
In the days and weeks to come, we'll keep working with the provinces and territories on this and on a whole range of other measures.
[voice of interpreter]more than ever we will have to work together to re-start our economy.
Our government will, therefore, continue to collaborate with itspartners to weather this crisis, particularly when it comes to contact tracing and testing.
We are also prepared to help theprovinces and territories protect vulnerable individuals, secure more P.P.E. and to focus on issues such as child care.
We are ready to work together to ensure that the recovery can be a safe one for everyone, and that's why today we are taking afirst step towards that goal by providing support to the municipalities who are currentlyexperiencing liquidity problems.
Today I'm announcing that we will grant $2.2 billion to municipalities in the coming weeks through the federal gas tax fund.
Normally the municipalities receive those payments twice in the year, but this is money theyneed now, to be able to continueto provide essential services.
So there will be a single payment for 2021 that will be provided now.
Minister mckenna has already sent letters to her counterparts in the province and territories to explain this accelerated process.
But this is what is important toremember.
We are making this investment toallow the municipalities to continue to ensure the safety ofcanadians.
We are supporting services that will help businesses to reopen and people to go back to work.
We are also looking at other ways of supporting the vital work that the cities and municipalities are doing across the country.
Of course there is still much todo so that we can start up our regular activities so that businesses reopen their doors and so that people can return towork.
But I know that together we willmake it. Thank you.

Thank you, Prime Minister.
We'll go to the phone for some questions.
One question, one follow-up. Operator?
