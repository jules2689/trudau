### Summary:


Over the weekend we saw thousands of people gather across the country to join peaceful protests against anti-black racism.
By standing together and denouncing the few who would tryto derail these demonstrations, Canadians are sending the message that they will never tolerate injustice.
The young black Canadians, I hear you when you say you are anxious and angry, when you say that this brings back painful experiences of racism that you've faced.
Together we will keep taking meaningful action to fight racism and discrimination in every form.
As leaders and allies, we must do the hard work needed to listen and learn.
That includes journalists who need to be able to do their workon the front lines to expose thetruth and tell the stories we need to hear, and we must as Canadians always keep working together to build a fairer, better, more equitable country for all.
Anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, injustice, they are also present in our country.

Of course, that includes journalists, who must be able todo their work on the ground to expose the truth and tell the stories that we have to hear.
Every province and territory will have its own approach, but as we move forward with re-starting the economy, we mustkeep working together.
I'm working closely with them, just like with mayors and other leaders, on what this approach should include, because there are a whole range of issues thatwill require us to take action together.
As I've said before, to keep Canadians safe, to give businesses the confidence to reopen their doors, and people the confidence to walk through those doors, we need to cooperate on country-wide testing and contact tracing.
At the same time, our governmentis ready to be a partner for theprovinces and territories in supporting vulnerable people, securing personal protective equipment, and working on child care, to name a few.
and today we're demonstrating a first step forward with support for municipalities as they face a cash crunch.
In response to COVID-19, we willmake available $2.2 billion for municipalities in the coming weeks through their yearly federal support with the gas taxfund.
Normally municipalities receive these payments in two instalments, but we know that cities and towns need this moneyright away as they deal with COVID-19.
Minister mckenna has sent letters to all of her provincialand territorial counterparts to outline how this accelerated process will work, but here's the bottom line.
This is strong support to keep Canadians safe and our communities strong.
and it's support that will give businesses the confidence to reopen, getting hard-working Canadians back on the job.
In the days and weeks to come, we'll keep working with the provinces and territories on this and on a whole range of other measures.
[voice of interpreter]more than ever we will have to work together to re-start our economy.
We are ready to work together to ensure that the recovery can be a safe one for everyone, and that's why today we are taking afirst step towards that goal by providing support to the municipalities who are currentlyexperiencing liquidity problems.
Today I'm announcing that we will grant $2.2 billion to municipalities in the coming weeks through the federal gas tax fund.
Normally the municipalities receive those payments twice in the year, but this is money theyneed now, to be able to continueto provide essential services.
We are supporting services that will help businesses to reopen and people to go back to work.
We are also looking at other ways of supporting the vital work that the cities and municipalities are doing across the country.
