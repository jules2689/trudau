### Summary:



Over the last few weeks our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians as we deal with this pandemic.
As I've said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for the people who built this country.
The greatest generation saw us through world war ii and we need to be there to support them properly.
I spoke with premier ford on this earlier this morning to let him know that, of course, we would be there to help as he takes action on improving care for seniors in long-term care centres.
Our government will continue to support ontarians through this and I know this is something the premier will be addressing in greater detail at his press conference later today. This represents hundreds of thousands of items, everything from masks to hospital gowns that we've shipped to our frontline workers.
They will keep people safe and help slow the spread of COVID-19. and for autoworkers in oshawa, this contract will support good, well-paying jobs and an industry that's faced tough times.
We're supporting companies and research centres across the country as they develop new, improved COVID-19 test kits and products.
On this, and on other supplies for frontline workers, I know that Minister Bains and Minister anand will have more details to share a little later today.




Over the past two months we rolled out targeted support for sectors hit hard by COVID-19.
With the growing season under way, farmers are working harder than ever to keep Canadians fed.
This will support the people who put food on our plates while creating new opportunities for young people.
This builds on what we've already done, for connecting Canadians of every age with work in the sector to supporting seasonal workers. Not only because the only way to fruili end this virus in Canada is to end it everywhere, but because as a trading nation, with Canadians who trace their origins to every corner of the planet, we understand better than most how connected the world has become.
More than 300 million people around the world will be out of work. Canada is ready to do our part as we help bring the world together in the fight against COVID-19. On Thursday, I will be convening a high-level meeting with the secretary of the to consider global economic challenges and how to better support developing countries.
We're bringing together leaders from every region of the world, as well as the heads of international institutions, to work on shared strategies to protect the global economy, support our citizens and help the most vulnerable.
To address this pandemic, to keep people safe, to help our economies weather the storm, we need to collaborate.
and with this forum, Canada will be there to help lead the way forward.
