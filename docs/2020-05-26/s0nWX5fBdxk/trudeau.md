# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the last few weeks our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians as we deal with this pandemic.
and as the need for their help continues, we've received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec.
and we will be following up. Members of the Canadian armed forces are doing an incredible job, just like always.
They are serving with distinction for our grandparents, our parents, our elders.
In Ontario, they've made some extremely troubling observations about several long-term care facilities in which they've been serving and we have shared this information with the provincial government.
As I've said many times, we need to do a better job of caring for the people who built this country.
The greatest generation saw us through world war ii and we need to be there to support them properly.
Through this global crisis.
I spoke with premier ford on this earlier this morning to let him know that, of course, we would be there to help as he takes action on improving care for seniors in long-term care centres.
Our government will continue to support ontarians through this and I know this is something the premier will be addressing in greater detail at his press conference later today.
This morning, I also wanted to provide an update in personal protective equipment.
In the last 10 weeks alone, over 40 flights have arrived in Canada carrying much needed P.P.E. This represents hundreds of thousands of items, everything from masks to hospital gowns that we've shipped to our frontline workers.
At the same time, we're also investing in production here at home.
and on that front, today we're taking yet another critical step forward.
I can announce that we signed a contract with general motorss to produce 10 million face masks.
As we speak, g. M. employees are already making these masks.
They will keep people safe and help slow the spread of COVID-19. and for autoworkers in oshawa, this contract will support good, well-paying jobs and an industry that's faced tough times.
On testing, we're also making progress.
We're supporting companies and research centres across the country as they develop new, improved COVID-19 test kits and products.
and for life-saving health care equipment, we signed a new contract for 10, 000 ventilators that are being produced through a partnership between canadian nobel laureate, Dr. Art mcdonald, his team and vexos.
Deliveries will begin this summer, bringing our total of made-in-Canada ventilators to 40, 000.
On this, and on other supplies for frontline workers, I know that Minister Bains and Minister anand will have more details to share a little later today.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

In the last 10 weeks, more than 40 flights carrying personal protective equipment have arrived in Canada.
We're talking about hundreds of thousands of different items, including hospital gowns and masks that have been distributed to our front line workers.
At the same time, we are working with companies right across this country to ramp up our domestic capacity to produce these articles here in Canada.
Today I'm able to announce that we have signed a contract with general motors to produce 10 million face masks.
At this point, g. M. employees have already begun to do that work and the first batch of masks will soon be available.
With respect to testing, we are also making progress.
Right across the country, we are supporting research centres that are designing new test kits for COVID-19. and we're doing the same thing on vents lay toss.
-- ventilators.
We have signed a contract to produce 10, 000 ventilators that will be made through a partnership between art McDonald, his team and the company vexos.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Over the past two months we rolled out targeted support for sectors hit hard by COVID-19. and we know that more needs to be done.
Just look at the food industry.
With the growing season under way, farmers are working harder than ever to keep Canadians fed.
But because of COVID-19, many are having trouble finding workers.
So, today I can announce that our government is funding up to 700 youth jobs in that industry.
This will support the people who put food on our plates while creating new opportunities for young people.
This builds on what we've already done, for connecting Canadians of every age with work in the sector to supporting seasonal workers.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

At the this time of year, farmers are working harder than ever to feed Canadians but because of COVID-19, a number of employers have having a lot of trouble finding workers to help them out.
So we will be funding up to 700 youth jobs in that sector.
That will help out those who feed our families while at the same time creating opportunities for students this summer.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

In the last week, Canadians have been focused on our families and on our neighbours, on our communities and our country.
But we've also been closely engaged with how the world is managing COVID-19. Not only because the only way to fruili end this virus in Canada is to end it everywhere, but because as a trading nation, with Canadians who trace their origins to every corner of the planet, we understand better than most how connected the world has become.
Canadian jobs and businesses depend on stable and productive economies in other countries so it matters to us how everyone weathers this storm.
For so many, this pandemic is devastating.
More than 300 million people around the world will be out of work.
and more than 30 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty.
We can't wait for others to act.
It's not in our self-interest and it's just not who we are.
We can and we must seize the opportunity to do what we can to make people safer and more prosperous, to create an international system who recognizes who's left behind and strives to lift them up. This is no small task.
But I know we're up to it. Canada is ready to do our part as we help bring the world together in the fight against COVID-19. On Thursday, I will be convening a high-level meeting with the secretary of the to consider global economic challenges and how to better support developing countries.
We're bringing together leaders from every region of the world, as well as the heads of international institutions, to work on shared strategies to protect the global economy, support our citizens and help the most vulnerable.
I've been speaking to many leaders about these issues and about the importance of global cooperation.
This includes chancellor merkel of germany and a president macron of france just yesterday and leaders from the caribbean and from across africa, latin america and the pacific.
and to key international financial experts, like Canada's own mark carney, are getting involved, too.
To address this pandemic, to keep people safe, to help our economies weather the storm, we need to collaborate.
and with this forum, Canada will be there to help lead the way forward.




**[Voice of Interpreter]**:

Canada is a trading nation with trading the links with many countries around the world.
Our workers, our economies, depend on a global economy that is healthy, and in the midst of a pandemic, we cannot close our eyes to the world we live in. We must not forget the most vulnerable.
Whether they're people who live in remote regions or people in the Caribbean.
For many of them, the pandemic has been a disaster.
As Canadians, we know that we have a role to play.
We can and we must build a safer and more prosperous world for everyone and ensure that our international system is fair and more equal for all.
This is quite a task.
But I know we're up to it. On Thursday, I will be convening a high-level meeting with the secretary-general of the u. N. and the Prime Minister of jamaica to address the current challenges and look at various ways of helping developing countries.
This will be an opportunity for leaders to get together and develop strategis to protect the global economy, support our citizens and help the most vulnerable.
I discussed those matters with a number of leaders.
Yesterday, I spoke to chancellor merkel of germany and president macron of france and I've also had discussions with leaders from the caribbean, latin america and the pacific region.
Of course, key financial experts as well, such as the canadian mark carney.
They will also be participating.
If we all work together, and we remain focused on what we must do, I know we will be able to get through this together.
and come back strong afterwards.
Thank you.
