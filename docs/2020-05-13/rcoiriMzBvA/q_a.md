**Interpreter**:

Mr. Trudeau, you talked about the re-opening of the economy, but in terms of [inaudible] would you be prepared to issue a recommendation or an order to all Canadians that they should wear a mask when they leave home? well, we are clearly seeing various regions have different realities.
Prince Edward Island, for example, is looking at very different situation from Ontario.
So we have to allow local and provincial authorities to determine which principles should guide their decisions about citizens.
But as we all know, the best way to protect ourselves is to stay home as much as possible and, if we must go out, to keep distance of two metres from other people.
Wearing a mask, according to experts, can help.
But it cannot replace the social distancing that we should be practicing as a priority.
Follow-up? yes, we saw you last week during the ceremony in trenton.
You kept your distance and you were also wearing a mask.
Why did you do that? and I'd like you to comment on the border.
Are the americans resisting the desire to keep the border closed? well, with respect to the trenton ceremony, that was the request of the canadian armed forces that everyone wear a mask at all times.
and this is a recommendation that we all followed.
With respect to the United States, the constructive discussions are continuing with the United States administration and ier can tell you that, so far, that partnership and that collaboration have been excellent and I see no reason why it should not continue to be so.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I can highlight, since the very beginning of this pandemic, the communications and collaboration with our American partners has been exceptional.
Conversations are ongoing all the time on a range of measures, including border measures, and I can tell you up until now that the conversation -- that a collaboration has been exceptional and see no reason for that to change.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, David lundgren, Reuters.
Line open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
On the border, we understand that the two sides have agreed to keep the restrictions in place until June 21. What happens in the future? if you decide the border should be shut and the Americans believe it should be open.
Will you keep it shut?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Right now we're making decisions for right now.
Obviously there are reflections on what next steps could be and might be in different situations and different progress -- progressions of COVID-19. But every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we're react and responding to the realities we see now and that is where we will stay focused.
We are focused on keeping Canadians safe every step of the way and we'll take the necessary decisions at every different step.



As a follow-up?



**Reporter**:

Secondly, secondly, the north way sovereign fund is blacklisting four Canadian oil sands companies.
Doesn't this suggest that the major oil sands have a lot more work to do for you to consider that they're aligning with federal climate goals?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We've seen investors around the world looking at the risks associated with climate change as an integral part of investment decisions they make.
That is why it is so important for Canada to continue to move forward on fighting climate change and reduce our emissions in all sectors and I can highlight that many companies in the energy sector have understood that the investment climate is shifting and there is a need for clear leadership and clear targets to reach on fighting climate change to draw on global capital.



Thank you.
Operator, next question.



**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.
Next question, the "national post". line open.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Yesterday, the Toronto transit commission came out and painted add dire finance picture for the next couple of months and it's says agencies are dealing with the same kind of financial picture.
I'm wondering if you think the federal government will have a role in helping deal with that, especially if it can mean big service cuts or potentially transit systems not operating.



Prime Minister Trudeau's I think we recognize we're in a very, very difficult situation right now where we have asked Canadians to cease a massive part of the economic activity that keeps this country going.
We've done this for the very important and clear reason for protecting Canadians's lives because we know that protecting the health and safety of Canadians is necessary for us to move forward with a strong country, economically or otherwise.
That is why the decision we've taken to keep Canadians safe need to come first.
The same time, we are looking at careful re-openings in gradual ways in different parts of the country and the federal government will be there to support the provinces and other organisations and industries as we look to doing the right way in a way that keeps Canadians safe.
There are going to be a lot of very important and delicate balances to strike over the coming weeks and months and we'll continue to be there to work with all partners to make sure that Canada is getting it right for Canadians.



As a follow-up, ryan?



**Reporter**:

I'm sorry, sir, but on transit systems specifically.
Like the transit control, like o. C. transpoe, do you think the federal government will play a role or is that a provincial responsibility?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

As we know, operation of transit systems is a provincial and municipal responsibility.
As a federal government, we have made significant investments in upgrading and strengthening transit systems across the country because we know it is a key part of both prosperity and moving forward in ways that make life affordable and fighting climate change at the same time for Canadians.
So, we will be there to listen to concerns that Canadians are expressing and different orders of governments are expressing on making sure that our re-opening is successful.
We know that public transit and getting people to work is going to be an important part of our economy moving forward.
But we also know that the challenges posed by social distancing and much greater working from home has come and affected our tranls sit system significantly.
So we're going to have to adjust and the federal government will be there to work with the provinces, including supporting them in their areas of jurisdiction in many cases.



**Reporter**:

Au fran√áois.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Rep we know that urban transit and transit services are important for this country's recovery and there are real challenges there because of physical distancing.
Of course, there are also a lot of people working from home now.
So our transit systems are receiving less revenues and we will be there to support the provinces and municipalities, if necessary.
But we also understand that operating transit systems is a provincial responsibility, not a federal responsibility.
and as I said, we will be there to help because we need Canada to re-open and we want that to be safe and gradual.







**Operator**:

Thank you.
Merci.




**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like us to come back to seniors homes.
You said yesterday that you were prepared to help the provinces meet their challenges, but this is not a federal area of jurisdiction.
How are you going to help them meet those challenges? are we just talking about transferring money to them? well, as I said from the outset, there will need to be conversations between the different levels of government and among Canadians.
In terms of finding ways to ensure that our seniors are not extremely vulnerable as they are now.
The federal government will be there to help.
and this is a federal commitment we made when we send in the armed forces to seniors homes.
But, of course, we did that in partnership with the province.
and we will continue to work with all the provinces in a positive spirit of collaboration to ensure that we are making and doing the right thing for Canadians.
Follow-up? yes, but I suppose that you do not intend to leave the army there over the long-term.
So in terms of your discussions on these long-term care homes, what are you thinking of? sending them more money? and could you explain since the problem is now, why not look a it right now and resolve the problem right now, rather than waiting until we finished counting dead bodis? well, I think we all see that we're in an extreme and urgent situation at this time.
and we have to take all the necessary steps right now to help in these long-term care facilities and that is what we're doing.
That is what we're focused on at this time.
But as well, in the months and years to come, we will have to look closely at the status of our seniors across the country and improve and enhance the systems that support them.
The floridaing have its footer play in that but we intend to respect the fact that this is provincial jurisdiction.



**Reporter**:

In regards to the border, your chief medical officer yesterday said Americans pose a risk to us. When was the last time you talked to president trump about the border and what pressure is the United States putting on Canada to re-open?



Prime Minister Trudeau's I think every country recognizes that, as we control our domestic situation, we are vulnerable to international travelers.
Different countries are facing different challenges.
and as we niang spread of COVID-19, we want to -- we will want to make sure that we're not becoming vulnerable from travelers arriving elsewhere.
That is why we made, you know, strong moves to secure, to close our borders, including to american travelers at this time.
As we move forward, we will continue to work with the administration and I can highlight that the work with the american administration continues to be constructive and positive.
I have spoken with president trump a number of times over the past weeks and our conversations have always been very positive.




**Interpreter**:

I think we all recognize that, as we protect Canadians in the country, through measures that will help to stop.
The spread of COVID-19, we remain as vulnerable to COVID-19 cases that could come from outside the country.
and that is why we're trying to put in extreme restrictions on travel from outside the country, including the United States.
We are pursue ago positive collaboration with the United States administration.
I've spoken several times to president trump in recent weeks and those discussions have always been RR positive.



**Reporter**:

It's exactly two months since you started giving these updates.
I know Canadians appreciate that.
But for obvious reasons we don't have a budget right now.
The p. B.o. Says the deficit could reach $1 trillion by the end of the year.
How much longer do Canadians have to wait to get a financial picture here of how much this is all costing us?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I think Canadians rightly expect us to be focused on the immediate in getting things settled so that Canadians can actually feel safe and look at careful re-opening.
At the same time, we have been transparent every step of the way about the investments we're making and will have, of course, we will continue to share with Canadians our outlook for the future.
We recognize, however, that the situation is changing incredibly rapidly.
and a budget is usually something that projects what is going to happen in the canadian economy for the next 12 months and right now we're having a lot of difficulty establishing with any certainty what is going to happen in the next 12 weeks.
We'll continue working on this.
We'll continue to be open and transparent with Canadians as much as possible.
But we will stay focused on hemming people in the immediate as we move toward a better future.



Au fran√áois.



**Interpreter**:

We know that we're dealing with an unprecedented situation where things change very quickly.
a budget or economic update normally sets out what can we -- what we can expect in the next 12 months.
and right now it is a real challenge to even know what will happen in the next few weeks.
So, we'll continue to be open and transparent.
We'll talk about our projections and expectations for the coming months.
At the same time, we want to remain focused on what must be done right now to ensure that we can have the best possible future ahead of us.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
David akin, global news.
To come back to molly's issue about the border.
Federal agencies have to plan to maintain the current United States-Canada border agencies.
Municipalities on the border have to make some plans about this.
Can you sort of give them some assurance today that the United States-Canada border restrictions will stay where they are until the end of June?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

We are a good week away from the expiry of the current phase of our border restrictions with the United States.
Conversations are ongoing, are cruxive, or productive.
I won't make any announcements today.
But I can say that things are going well and we're confident about being able to continue to keep Canadians safe.



and to come back on molly's question about fiscal updates and budgets.
When we went through the crisis in '08-'09, we've had multiple fiscal updates and we've had multiple budgets because of elections and whatever and it is hard to understand why you could haven't a budget now and update that budget in three months or even a month if you needed to. Why not a budget or at the very least a fiscal update with the promise to update it in a couple of months?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

Again, we have been focused very much on responding to this unprecedented situation.
By getting money into the pockets of Canadians, of workers and families who need it across the country.
Unlike previous recessions or economic downturns, this is a situation that has no antecedents.
It has forced us to choose a massive amount of economic activity in this country to keep Canadians safe.
We continue to work every day on supporting Canadians.
We continue to be absolutely transparent about the measures we're putting forward for Canadians and we will continue to look for ways to keep people apprised on we expect for the coming months.
As we say, things are changing extremely quickly and we want to make sure we're pouting our expert where is they're most useful which is both sharing with Canadians everything we're doing as we're doing it and staying focused on what we need to do right now.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
This week, me cal research institutes across the country will begin to lay off 10, 000 to 15, 000 people who work on health research because they can't get the support of the federal government.
They don't qualify for your wage subsidy programme and that is going to have a cascade effect even ton COVID-19 research that is happening because these research institutes provide the infrastructure that supports that.
Can you explain to me why it is not a priority to keep those critical employees tethered to their employer?



Prime Minister Trudeau's on the contrary.
We have made significant investments in the hundreds of millions of dollars into science and research across Canada.
We know that this is a crisis that is science-based.
It is caused by a medical challenge of COVID-19 and we need to use science to get ourselves through this.
That is why our investments in science, our investments in supporting graduate students, our investments in supporting research institutes will continue.
I'll follow-up on this issue you are bringing up but our focus is on making sure that scientists go et the support they need across the country.
We'll continue to do that.



Thank you.



**Reporter**:

Hi, Prime Minister.
Tom parry with CBC.
Ontario says it will wrap up testing at long-term care facilities in the next couple of days.
Quebec is nowhere near that.
You are a Quebec M.P. can I ask you why do you think the province is having such a hard time with this? and is there anything more you can do to help?



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

The responsibility of the federal government is to support the provinces in delivering their plans for things like testing and P.P.E., their plans for re opening.
We are there to work with the province and ensure that they have the equipment and capabilities they need, whether it has been procuring swabs for testing kits around the country.
Whether it's moving foreward on domestic production of the reagent necessary for producing results from those tests.
The federal government has been extremely active and we will continue to be there to respond to the provinces and their plans and their needs for more testing.
It's snag we know is an essential part of how we move forward on a careful re-opening.




**Interpreter**:

The role of the federal government is to be there to support the provinces, to execute their plan.
Whether it means providing and procuring the equipment they need to do the testing or bringing in the chemicals that are needed to analyze the results.
The federal government has taken many, many steps to be there and support the provinces with their plan.
But when it comes to testing, those issues are determined by the province and the federal government will be there to provide its support and we'll continue to be there for them.



**Reporter**:

Steve chase, "globe and mail". Mr. Prime Minister, your ambassador to china, Dominic Barton, told a group of Canadians last week that china, because of its conduct, is alienating foreign countries and injuring its goodwill abroad.
As Mr. Barton put it in foreign policy jargon, china is accumulating negative soft power around the world, that it is undermining its international influence and the ability to persuade other countries to see thing beijing's way.
You hired Mr. Barton because of his expertise in china.
So, the question for you is, do you agree with his assessment?



Prime Minister Trudeau's I think it is clear that there are many questions for countries around the origins and behaviour in the early days of the COVID-19 situation, particularly questions for china that we've called on to be asked in the coming months so we can get answers.
At the same time, we're seeing a global pan democratic that requires a global, coordinated response and how countries are behaving now towards each other and supporting each other, moving forward in a difficult time is being noticed by everyone and I think it's totally normal that we be asking questions about how different countries are behaving, including china.




**Interpreter**:

From the very beginning, we have known that there would be difficult questions to put to a number of countries, including china regarding the origins and the beginning of this virus and how it turned global.
At the same time, we know that a global pandemic means that there needs to be global answers and the different countries have to collaborate and work together to come through this.
Of course, the countries out there who are not behaving as they should will be receiving questions and people will be drawing conclusions about the way they behaved.
With respect to china again, in recent weeks, you've been very, very cautious every time there is talk of china and you're asked to comment on australia's idea to conduct an inquiry.
Why is that? are you afraid that this will have an impact on medical supplies from china? or do you think that you will suffer reprisals? I can tell you that My responsibility now, and at all times, is to ensure the welfare and safety of all Canadians.
That is My major concern in this pandemic and we must work with everyone to secure the necessary equipment and to establish the necessary partnerships that will allow us to come through this.
Yes, we will all have questions that need to be answer AD in the coming weeks as to how some countries behaved, including china.
But My responsibility every step of the way is making sure I'm doing everything possible to support and protect Canadians during this crisis and that is what I intend to do.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

My responsibility, first and foremost as Prime Minister, is to look out for Canadians, to make sure that we're keeping Canadians safe and healthy and whole as much as possible in good times and in times of crisis.
That is why even though, of course we will have very strong questions to ask of many different countries through how this pandemic began and promulgated around the world.
My focus needs to be on ensuring that we're getting the support necessary for Canadians every step of the way in terms of P.P.E., in terms of testing capacities, in terms of partnerships towards getting treatments and vaccines for this.
My focus needs to be on keeping Canadians safe and that is where it will stay.



**[SPEAKING FRENCH] >> Prime Minister Trudeau**:





**Marcy**:

All right.
That is the Prime Minister of Canada, a little earlier than usual as he will be appearing at the COVID-19 committee that takes place in person on Wednesdays.
I'll bring in My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and the cbc's David Cochrane to talk more about what the Prime Minister had to say.
I guess some good news that you already had yesterday, Vassy, but confirmed now by the Prime Minister for students who are waiting to see when they could tap into their aid.
