### Summary:



I want to turn to what we're doing to help employers keep their employees.
Over the past few weeks, our government has unveiled a number of measures to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis.
We launched the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
We also introduced the Canada emergency business account to support those struggling with cash flow.
So far more than half a million small businesses have received a loan through the Cebu and over 120, 000 employer have be ens approved to receive the Canada emergency wage subsidy for almost two million workers.
The fund willing flow through the six regional agencies with a proportion dedicated to the community futures network to assist businesses in rural and remote regions.
Today, we're releasing more details on how that money will be split between the Atlantic Canada opportunities agency, Canada economic development for Quebec regions, western economic diversification Canada and cannorth.
and here's the bottom line -- these organisations understand the economic realities and specific challenges facing both your region and your business.
If you are struggling but did not qualify for other programmes like the wage subsidy or the emergency business account, give them a call.




From the outset, our government has been focused on getting people the help they need, as quickly as possible.
a few weeks ago, we launched the Canada emergency student benefit as part of our $9 billion plan to help young people get through the next few months.
