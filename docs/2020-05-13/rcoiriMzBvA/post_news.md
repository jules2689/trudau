# News after the Speech



**Vassy**:

They will be able to apply starting Friday t Prime Minister confirmed.
An important note, I was just speaking with somebody who works in the government, in the department with all this and apparently the site explaining how you can apply and what the process will be like will go live today.
If you are a student and watching and interested in that information, I've also heard from a number of people who are concerned that, because they've never filed taxes, they won't be able to use the My C.R.A. Account, which is the fastest way to get this money delivered.
There will be an explanation on the website as well for you about how you're going apply and what you need to do. So, if you're interested and you need that money, go on the website or google it today and I'm sure we'll see the link as soon as it's live.
But that will be live today.
a couple of other things that jumped out at me. First of all, the second part of the announcement was basically where this big pile of money, about $1 billion that had already been afoundsed -- announced by the federal government, where it's going as far as economic regional developmenttal agencis are concerned.
The framing from the government is that if you have not been able to access the wage subsidy or emergency business" -- and thater lot of people have have heard of in that position, mostly self-employed, for example, or those who have contract workers who don't have a payroll that meets the qualifications for either of those packages for financial aid, you will be able to go to these regional economic development agencies.
That is the idea, at least.
That is the way it is framed.
and perhaps be able to access the money that you need through them.
I heard from a number of people who reached out to those agencies to try and see how that is going to work and they did not have the details yet.
Hopefully today it becomes a bit more clear to them and, in turn, to the bhaoem need that money, how they might be able to access it. It's a parcel of money.
Nearly $1 billion.
and finally, Rosie, on that last exchange with the Prime Minister, that is based on a report from the "globe and mail" about a group or grouping, a meeting that Dominic Barton, our ambassador to china had, in which he was critical of china and the wait's acted through this, saying I believe -- he back add rigorous review of the world health organization and that he thought that china's conduct is damaging its own global soft power.
What the Prime Minister was asked specifically from the reporter behind that story, Steve chase, was do you agree with those comments? and the Prime Minister did not address the substance of that question.
He, instead, repeated something we've heard most times he's asked action china which is that the questions being asked are genuine, the time to investigate those questions isn't really now.
But no change in answer there.
and definitely not a specific, you know, is Dominic Barton in trouble or not, time of thing.



**Rosemary**:

We should say it was a private meeting.



**Reporter**:

It was.



**Rosemary**:

Those comments weren't made publicly and the ambassador wouldn't v expected them to be leaked.
You should expect everything to be leaked these days --[laughter]but they are private comments but the private posture of any government about china is different than it is publicly.
Whether it should be is a d*ifrnl thing.
You made a good point about the regional development programme and we'll talk to someone in a minute because the Prime Minister said if you didn't qualify for all the things, give us a call.
We're here for you.
It seems to be the suggestion that this is another place you can go within your region, if you've had problems with the other programmes you pointed out there.
I wanted to talk a little bit about the border, too.
You can go where you want there, day.
I would say after doing some reading this morning, there is more than a dozen states in the United States, including ones along our border, like maine, for instance, who are nowhere meeting what washington has set forward as some of the parameters for re-opening that 14-day decline in cases, and they're still moving forward on re-opening which should give you a sense of what we're dealing with here in terms of the danger next door and doesn't sound like there is a deal yet.
But probably there will be.



**Reporter**:

One of the big challenges for Canada in all of this, there's very few things you can completely control in the middle of a pandemic that's based on a viral outbreak.
But you can take control of your own internal health measures and re-openings to work with the provinces to have.
a coordinated response and that is happening at the first ministers meetings which are happening every single week and then all the various ministerial-level meetings where there is a sense of goodwill and working together and centralizing procurement and coordinating guidelines on re-opening and all of that is helpful internally.
For society and the economy of Canada to come back to normal, south of the border needs to get under control.
and right now the United States is still the epicenter of the virus.
More than one-third of all of the global cases there.
and it's gone from the big cities and moving into the american heartland now in quite an alarming way and there is really no way for Canada to influence the economic measures , the stimulus measures and the health measures that happen in the United States of america.
Until that gets under control, I can't envision a path forward for Canada to be willing to re-open the canadian-United States border to anything other than the intention travel that is necessary to keep supply chains and economic activity going at the level that it is operating at right now.
Maybe different sectors could be added to that, a tweaking of that.
But tourism, visitation, hospitality, you can forget it. There is just -- there is a lot of concern, I think globally, with how the United States has reacted to this.
and the turf war that has evolved between the national government and state level governments and municipal-level governments in the United States and all of the problems that that brings from a viral spread issue and an economic challenge issue and there's no doubt that this border closure is going to be feted into June.
There was a good question from our colleague, david from reuters, about what happens if Canada and the United States disagree on whether or not to re-open the border.
The hope is that Canada flies under the radar in some respect politically in the United States because they have enough domestic problems to occupy them in the run-up to the convention and presidential election in the fall that re-opening the canadian border is far, far, far down the priority list for the United States government compared to all the other things it's dealing with in federal-state relations.



**Rosemary**:

I wand ed to take a minute to talk about long-term care there with both of you.
I found the Prime Minister's comments interesting.
When he was asked, you know, what are you going to do, are we going to have a rethink, how are we going to approach the reform of long-term care in this country.
and I view this as a bit of a dig.
I might be wrong.
He said we will be there to help, we have a federal economy.
Remember, we sent in the military because today there was some comments by the bloc leader who was not at all interested, obviously, in the federal government getting involved in this conversation.
But I think that because the difficult tootinger make, and I'll start with you, Vassy, when you have so many canadian armed forces members in long-term care centres keeping people going and keeping those centres going.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
Mr. Blanched was unequivocal.
Send more money and don't send a single string attached to it was his mess Tao the federal government.
He wanted the government to stay as far away from the delivery of health care as I can imagine.
I imagine that is a notion that's shared for those throughout Quebec.
But it's permeated so much of the stuff we talked about the last two weeks is significant for long-term care homes because they're very much turn province's per view.
At the same time, we have heard an acknowledgment very frequently, especially over the last month from the Prime Minister that what has unfolded in these homes is tragic.
It is horrifying and that there is going to have to be sort of a moment at the end of all this or longer than a moment in which we reflect on it and figure out how to address those issues.
Now the federal government and the Prime Minister himself has not been specific about how that will happen at all.
In fact, there have been a number of questions, including today, put to both him and the Minister of seniors around what mechanism does the federal government have to do that.
Does it mean that you conduct a formal inquiry or some kind of commission at the end of all this.
Does it mean that the term care homes start falling under the Canada health act so the federal government can exercise more powers or have more jurisdiction over this? does it mean that there is a specific envelope of funding that goes toward this is or that those voluntary guidelines in place right now for those homes become more than voluntary, become something that they have to adhere to. I think there are a nublg of genuine questions for the federal government about what role they're going to play in the rehabilitation of the system at largement but there are no, at this point, specifics being offered by the Prime Minister or anyone else in his government about exactly how that's going to happen.
Though there is thisacknowledgment that they're going to have to play some role.
To Mr. Blanchet's point, he doesn't want them to play any role and he pushes back against contention or argument that if the federal government was involved or is to be involved, the situation would be different.
We don't haves any proof that that would be the case.
I take that point.
But I think people who are watching their loved ones in their homes right now just want someone to do something.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
If the solution turns out is financing, and I guess that's what the federal government would do is hand over more money t provinces would have to be able to demonstrate that they took their responsibilities and their decision-making properly when they were looking after long-term care centres up to this point.
and I'm not sure that they would be able to adequately demonstrate that to the point where no conditions attached to the money would be possible and I'm not sure that the federal government would be. I know I'm way down the road here.
I'm not sure the federal government would be interested in that anyway.
If this is going to be a reform of a system, it is going to have to be something that is quite significant and that everyone will participate in, david.



**Reporter**:

Yeah.
a couple of things.
First, for what it's worth, when you speak to people who work for the Prime Minister, one of things they tell you is that what has happened in long-term care and seniors homes in particular, is the number one thing that has stuck with him throughout this, in terms of the need for remedy.
What that looks like at this point, who knows? Mr. Blanchet can say send money to Quebec than will magically solve the problem.
Yoingt's -I don't think it's as simple as that.
Not all provinces have the long-term care problem that we see in Quebec.
Quebec gets large amount as of equalization.
There is a lot of federal cash transfers to Quebec.
You know, more than British Columbia gets and British Columbia has not had the outbreak problems in their homes that we have seen in Quebec.
They have had them, but you know, bonnie henry as the medical officer out there, as we pointed out many times, has acted on this very early to limit the movement of staff between different homes forcing them to work in one particular place after the outbreak and they've been able to get these things under control.
There are still issues across the country in any kind of communal living thing.
But it's interesting that the conversation is very forward-looking in terms of what do we need to do and how much money do we need to put into the system to fix this thing going forward? I think that is important.
If I had a family member in one of those homes and lost a loved one in one of those homes, I'd want a backward-looking component to this, too.
To tans question of how it was that so many homes in so many places were left so exposed when we knew what would happen from the living example of what was happening in italy, for example, of what happens when it gets into care homes and seniors populations.
We had it right there in a g-7 country.
So I think I would like to know if I had someone in those homes, what kind of answers will there be in terms of why we didn't, as a country, take more immediate steps to put -- I think it was Ontario premier doug ford, a field fence or iron fence around the long-term care homes.
There was talk about it, but clearly not the right of action and was it as imminently foreseeable as a lot of people might suggest that it was.



**Rosemary**:

and that may be while there's two class-action suits seeking to get some answers for some of those people not yet certified.
Ok. I'm -- I'll come back to you.
Thank you very much.
Jack sydney is in toronto, but he is a first-year student at mcgill university and blair cuson is the author of cafe lara in halifax.
Good to see you both.
Jack, I'll start with you f you don't mind.
I want to talk to you about a couple of things.
But the student aid will open up on Friday.
My first question is, are you going to apply, do you really need it, did you need it two weeks ago? [laughter]



So I AM going to apply.
Especially with all the uncertainty around jobs this summer.
It's really important that students like me have a way that we're able to pay for our textbooks and our tuition this coming semester.



**Rosemary**:

and have you looked for a job? is it totally impossible? give me a sense of what it is like out there.



Yeah.
So I'm signed up to be a camp counselor this summer.
But obviously there is a lot of uncertainty about whether that goes forward.
So they have been in contact with us. But there is no final decisions yet.
So it really depends.
But it's looking very uncertain.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, I would imagine.
and the government previously announced this plan where you could maybe get a job doing essential services and volunteer work getting additional cash.
Are those things that you've considered, too?



Yeah.
and I would love to help out the community in whatever way possible.
I think far lot of students, they're worried -- especially those who are self-funding their tuition.
They're worried that it won't be enough.
and I think it is a fair assessment.



**Rosemary**:

is that your case? are you paying for it all by yourself? and how --



I'm not.
I'm lucky to be in a situation where I don't have that entire burden on me. But I know a lot of My peers are in that situation.
and they're not certain what is going to happen.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah.
It's super scary.
and the 1250 that you will be able to get once you start tapping into it on Friday, what are you using that for? do you have an apartment in Montreal that you are holding on to? give me a sense.



I actually had to stop My apartment search when the whole situation started.
a lot of My friends already have one booked.
and a few months alone, that money will be spent helping with that, and that is ignoring the cost of tuition and textbooks.
So they're very concerned that they don't -- they won't know what they will be able to do.



**Rosemary**:

The other thing, because a lot of universities are about to make this decision or have made the decision and that is the fact that your courses will be online in the fall.
You know this now.
I guess you could do it from Toronto, if you wanted to. How are you feeling about that in terms of your education?



Yeah.
So mcgill recently sent an e-mail saying that the majority, if not the entirety, of their courses are going to be online this coming fall semester.
and they said that they're going offer the same quality of education and I'm sure they're going to try their very best.
When you have a situation where your entire education is online, it is inevitable that it's not as high a quality as it would be if you were in person.
Especially for students who have labs.
I don't know how mcgill plans to do that, but labs are participatory classes.
and definitely going to be a big challenge to continue that.



**Rosemary**:

and you would be a first-year student at mcgill, too.
So you'll miss out on the fun stuff about that first year experience, too.



Yeah.
I just finished My first year.
I'm going into My second year.



**Rosemary**:

Ok.



But all the extra curricula rs for first-year students, their frosh experience or even just the first experience at university is such a big thing and such a big part of My experience there so far and it's really sad to think that they won't be able to share that.



**Rosemary**:

For sure.
Have you decided if you are going to go to Montreal and do it in Montreal or are you going to do it from where you are in Toronto?



I plan to go back to Mon traoefm everything is still up in the air now.
But hopefully I would still be able to get some of that, you know, student life experience just in the sense that I'm living in My own apartment with a roommate and I'm really caring for myself in that regard.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. jack.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck.



Thank you so much.



**Rosemary**:

As the Prime Minister said, sign up at the C.R.A. Account to get that benefit quickly.
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with everything.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

That is Jackson Sydney a student at mcgill.
We want to turn to something else that the Prime Minister talked about there.
a few more details around the billion dollars in emergency aid for businesses in regions.
They're going to be filtered through regional offices.
Development offices and we'll get more details from Minister jolly about that shortly.
Nice to see you, Lara.



Nice to see you as well, Rosie.
Thank you for having me on the show.
I want to let you know I'm also the chair of the Nova Scotia small business affiliation, which was created during COVID-19 timesful



**Rosemary**:

There you go. So much needed.
and you're following things really closely, then.
It seems as though acoa, the Atlantic regional development organization is going to get about $110 million out of that $1 billion and it did sound to me like the Prime Minister was pretty open to people having trouble taping into that money.
So, maybe just give me your experience.
Have you been able to access any of the support out there that the government has made available?



The premier has created a lot of great programmes to get money in the hands of citizens, right in the hands of small businesses and I think this programme shows that exactly.
Now e devil is in the detail every time and I think their intentions are good.
But we're not always seeing the money going into the right places.
and so we need businesses that are most vulnerable right now.
The ones who could not qualify for some of the other government programmes provincially as well as federally.
To see those funds via acoa.



**Rosemary**:

So you used the Nova Scotia benefit or the aid there, the loans.
But you haven't been able to use anything from the federal government, is that right?



Well, currently our provincial government with the best intentions created a programme three business days before April 1 for commercial tenants to sign with their landlords.
Unfortunately that protected the landlords and each of the tenants and we have to repay those funds.
Commercial tenants are very interested in the Atlantic regions in participating in the programme.
However, we have to make that transition somehow.
Our tenants are in a very vulnerable position.
They are not a situation to is negotiate with their landlords and it is creating tense relationships.
We understand that the landlords need help as well but the burden has to be shared and this programme was created for this.
Now make so it that landlords actually participate in the programme and that small businesses survive during this time because cash flow is very important right now.
We need to manage it to make sure that during a post-COVID-19 economy, we'll survive.
When we re-open, not all businesses will be able to re-open right away.
We're looking at small retail, wellness, tatoo parlours, salons, gyms, they will not be able to re-open immediately so they really rely on this rent relief immediately as well as this programme via acoa to get them through these tough times until re-opening is set for them.
When we do re-open, and in the restaurant industry, I'll probably be able to re-open sooner.
Our revenue will be a lot less, but the fixed costs are the same.
So we need to be planning our cash flow accordingly.
We just hope it goes into the hands of businesses that need it the most, that are the most vulnerable during this time.
The main two businesses, the neighbourhood businesses and mom-and-pop shops who hire most of Canada, for instance.
It is form keep them alive.
-- it is important to keep them alive.
and they're heavily rehind on the revenue from small businesses so it is within their best interest to keep us alive to make sure we survive through this pan doefmic.
-- pandemic.



**Rosemary**:

There is a lot of people who have that concern around the commercial rent assistance programme.
We're supposed to get more -- it opens this week, but there are people concerned because there is not a lot of incentive for landlords to participate and there is other problems with it as well in terms of whether you have a mortgage or not.
So, I hear you loud and clear on that part.
What is your biggest concern personally for your cafe right now if you can't get some additional help.
I mean, how are you going to keep going, if this lasts a little bit longer?



I think it is really important during this time that everyone works in a cooperative manner and everyone supports each other and all businesses work together to get through this, but we need to see the same cooperation from commercial land lords and government.
Everyone has to work together in this.
The cooperation we haven't seen yet is from financial institutions and a potential idea here is that the financial institutions extend their mortgages with our landlords and our landlords could then extend our lease agreement and that would effectively keep everyone in a good position to re-open and survive this economy.
and we really don't know, after we re-open f three months later we'll all have to close down again.
The financial aid from the government will be depleted at that point.
What happens at that point in we need to be looking ahead.
This post-COVID-19 economy could last for two years for all we know and we have to be prepared.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Good luck.
We'll check back with you if you don't mind.
Nice to meet you.



Thank you so much.
Cheers.



**Rosemary**:

Owner of cafe Lara in Halifax.
Maybe I'll go back, if I have time, to Vassy and David, to just quickly, Vassy, talk about the serological testing that we tried to start off this hour with because the Prime Minister did mention it right off the top and it is a bit of a milestone in hopes that it will work and be able to do what we hope the serological tests will do.



**Vassy**:

I'll be quick.
Hope is key in all this.
This is the kind of test that tests for antibodies so to determine who has had coronavirus already, it is strumtal or could be, hopefully instrumental in figuring out immunity and what parts of the economy can re-open.
There are genuine questions, though, from the scientific community about whether or not if you have those antibodies, it necessarily means for sure you are immune.
There is a lack of data on that right now but it is a big hopeful sign and a landmark that one of those tests has been approved for use.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you very much for your help in this haoer.
They're hoping to collect one million blood samples from Canadians over two years to get a sense of immunity and antibodies in the population writ large, things that we don't know a lot about right now.
Later tonight, I'll be hosting another special called "living with COVID-19." it's about your job, your money, your future, many of the things that we talk about here, but we'll also take some of your questions and we'll have special guests on thaonld help answer them.
You can be part of that show by sending your questions to COVID-19. Cbc@cbc.
Ca. You can catch it on cbc gem, cbc listen, the cbc news app.
Everywhere, basically.
Watch it at 7:00 PM local time.
That is right across the country.
We'll take a short break.
When we come back, more on how the government response to COVID-19 is playing out today.



**Rosemary**:

Thanks for joiningus.
This hour, until details onottawa's plan for economic recovery targeted today around support of regional businesses.
The Prime Minister just revealed that close to two million workers are being kept on company payrolls through the emergency wage subsidyprogramme, which is also nowopen.
Also in his daily briefing, the prime Minister talked aboutstudent's help, that emergency student benefit will be open starting on Friday.
As we stand by and wait for a if you more details from frankly ministers and officials, we'rewaiting for the prime minister to reappear at the house ofcommons, physically, where thecovid-19 committee will be examining different issues and the Prime Minister and minister swill be



I think the most important thing for me to be able to answer is to be able to ascertain what the ask of the United states is. Does the United States want to completely are relaxrestrictions? are they Ok.with something inbetween what we have now andrelaxation or do they want themto stay the way they are? and the Prime Minister says thetalks are productive.
People I've been talking withbehind the scenes are not givingme the indication there's atonne of pushback.
If one thing is consistent, the United states and white houseadministration is unpredictable.
I don't know the position thewhite house will take and it'svery important as economies andstates begin to reopen, in themiddle, I



**Vassy**:

Maybe they can satisfy some of the concerns both in the United States and here in Canada.



**Rosemary**:

Could you just expand the list of people who are essential or exceptional and maybe it's something where you would have to even just here inottawa, if you want to travel togatineau, you have to have letter from your employer saying that you have a job and you'regoing to your job or office and maybe it could be as simple asthat.
and that might work for Windsor.
I don't know it would work foreveryone, David, because we'veheard from premiers who are concerned of the 2500 or soamericans that tried to cross the border from March until may and most of it was discretionary and most wanted to go to birthday party and it was recreational and if you have to start cracking down on that.
In terms of dealing with the United States, one thing that's lesspredictable, it might be the president of the United States.
Things are good andconstructiontive with donaldtrump up until the momentthey're not and so that's thechallenge.
I mean, one thing that, youknow, maybe plays in Canada'sfavour because the desire to keep the border closed iswide-spread is that you have apresident who likes closingborders and likes demonstrableacts saying he's keeping peoplesafe despite what's happening inthe states that make up the United States so the political calendar is thebig unknown, right? they'll have their election, their presidential election, youknow, donald trump versus joebiden.
and just how much all of thisbecomes a part of thatconversation and part of thatpolitical dynamic is unknown andunknowable at this point intime.
I mean, surely, the pointingpandemicwill be a big part of tepolitical dynamic in Canada buthow thaw then drives decisionsis a big question.
We get the extension from mayuntil June and in June, you'rein the convention season wherethe parties pick their nominees.
and we have, obviously, a stateelection and senatorialelections and the presidentialelection becomes an issue in theborder states who may have, likethe mayor of windsor, cross-border economic concerns, cross-border other concerns thatbecome a part of the politicaldynamic.
So I don't know if there's agood time for a pandemic tostrike, rosie, but in the middleof a hotly contested andextremely volatile presidentialelection cycle with us strappedto the back of the gianteconomic and political beast, ithink that's a level ofcomplication the canadiangovernment would rather dowithout.



**Rosemary**:

All very goodpoints.
I would say there's no good time for a pandemic, speakingpersonally.
I would say this is the only one want to experience.
I didn't hear the control room and oh, they are questioningministers.



Our priority was getting money to all Canadians who we rein need in a quick way andthat's exactly what we've done and millions of canadiansreceived the money they needed so dearly and I want to be veryclear, that fraud is unacceptable and we do have measures in place to detect taxcheats.



**Andrew Scheer**:

They want public serve events to turn blind eye to public fraud.
Did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings?



The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

The priority in this situation is getting money out to the millions of Canadians who need edit as quickly as possible, but, of course, fraud is unacceptable and that's why we put safeguards in place to ensure anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.



Mr. Scheer.



**Andrew Scheer**:

Did the government give any instructs to public servants to ignore red flags or warnings? yes or no?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Ins was to get money out to money who needed it as quickly aspossible.
We have put measures in place to detect fraud.
People who got this money fraudulently will have to repairit.



**Andrew Scheer**:

You can'tanswer a yes or no question, so we can assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people and letting so manycanadians down.
Small business owners who don'thave a Cara payroll number or business account are ineligible for the government supports, individuals, owner/operators andthose being earned more arebeing told they don't qualify.
Meanwhile, fraud office fraudst.
Does the Prime Minister thinkthis is fair?



The right honourable prime



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Mr. Speaker, Canadians will know this is an unprecedented situation in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible.
That is exactly what we did.
We continue to work very hard to fill gaps with people who should get money who haven't been able to and like I said, we have strong measures to counterfraud.
Anyone who got this fraudulently will have to repay it.



**Andrew Scheer**:

When she's of these programmes were firstdesigned, the prime minister acknowledged there were problem sand would be fixed later.
Here we are in May and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reason.
Will the Prime Minister make these simple changes, allowing business owners who don't have business bank account and don'thappen to have a Cara payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they'vebeen paid by family members through dividends, will they finally make these changes or is he going to continue letting hundreds of thousands ofcanadians down during this pink?



The right honourable prime



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Mr. Speaker, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions ofcanadians and that was the priority and that is what we'vebeen doing for the past twomonths.
As we've said, we will continue to tweak and improve to make sure that more people who need it are getting it and we are working as best we can, as fast as we can to help those millions of Canadians who need support.



We have time for a 15-secondquestion.



**Andrew Scheer**:

The Prime Minister indicated he would support taiwan's inclusion in the W.H.O. Only as a non-stateobserver.
Of course, that doesn't exist.
Will the Prime Minister supporttaiwan's participation as Astarte observer?



The right honourable Prime Minister in 15 seconds or less,



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Mr. Speaker, we will continue with the Chinese policy but we will do so where it makes sense and that includes at the W.H.O.



We'll now continue withmr.
Blanchet.
Thank you very much, chair.
Friday, students if Quebec incanada can make a request for the curb for students and that'sgood news.
This was a necessary programmebecause the number of students that won't be able to get their summer job they had last year is much higher than the number of jobs that could be available for these people and we don't know how long these jobs will not be available for.
There are people who said thatthere's a risk in terms of meeting the job market needs and the Prime Minister made a clear commitment to create incentives for students work.
Between now and Friday, because we need to know what the commitment is, will there be job incentives that will accompany the curb? the right honourable Prime Minister.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Would like to thank the honourable member for his understanding of this question and to understand how important it is to support students whowon't be able, for the mostpart, to be able to have Summer job to count on. But we know that students don'tjust want money.
They want work experience and that is why we're establishing programs such as Canada's summer jobs and other programmes to create 70, 000 key jobs in important sectors so that they can also get jobs.
We're going to continue to work with young people and with employers to ensure that we can fill the gaps in the job market sand ensure that young people are properly support.
Mr. Blanchet.



That's quite interesting, but it doesn't answer My question atall.
People in the fishing industry, tourism and agriculture and ingeneral, they've expressed fears that people, if they take a job, they'll lose their benefit or they won't work at all.
and the more you earn at yourjob, the less you'll get, but we think that after you earn your thousand dollars, that should be kept -- there should be -- well, since you made a commitment two weeks ago, can you look at incentives right now.
This won't last eight months.
Prime Minister?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Yoyneed job experience and we're in an unprecedented situation andthat's why we're working with seasonal industries in various regions to ensure that we do have enough labour available and to help them and students can do their share.
At the same time, we have to ensure they have the necessary support for all of those whowon't find jobs and that's whywe're continuing to work with the industries in question, to ensure that we do have labour available and also to supportstudents.
Mr. Blanchet.



Unfortunately, the whole spirit of this question doesn'tseem to be understood.
In the best possible scenario, doubt that the government can bring back all the jobs that itwon't be necessary for students to take on. There will be some missing, first.
and second, people aren't crazy and people will say, if I earn less by going to work, then saying at home, no good will help to solve this issue.
Can we ensure that the more someone will work, the more money they'll get.
I think we need a clear response given the deadlines in question and the fact that the people are going to sign up for theprogramme Friday.
Principles are nice, but we need clear answer on this.
The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

As of Friday, students will be able to apply for the emergency benefit for them and when theyapply, they will also be directed to a job bank that we have established to make sure that they know what available jobs there are.
and they'll know how they'll be able to get money they need, but also the necessary professional experience that they'll need for their future and while helping our society in this.
I know we'll be able to count onthem.



Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, one of the most devastating outcomes of thiscovid-19 crisis has been the impact on seniors.
80% or more of the deaths duringcovid-19 have been seniors living in long-term care homesand the military had to becalled in. Out of 14 countries, Canada hasbeen deemed the worst in itscare of seniors.
Despite all of this, the Prime Minister has said recently saidhe doesn't feel it the Prime Minister's responsibility tofind a solution.
How can he say that to familiesreeling with the loss that it'snot his responsibility to solvethis problem? justin trudeau perhaps that theNDP Has not many seats inquebec forgets the importance ofrespecting the constitution andprovisional versus federalgovernment.
We will be there to work withthe provinces as they deal withchallenges in their long-termcare facilities and we are thereas a partner, but we, on thisside of the house, will alwaysrespect the jurisdiction of theprovinces and be there tosupport them in fulfilling thoseresponsibilities.



Everyone across Canada saw this Prime Minister double down despite the fact that thecanadian military had to go intolong-term care home.
There is a role the federalgovernment can play.
The federal government, bothliberal and conservative, havebeen consistently, for decadesbeen cutting transfers tohealthcare.
They can increase thosetransfers to ensure thatlong-term care is adequatelyfunded.
We can also ensure there's anational care guarantee, workingwith provinces to meet the beststandard.
We can increase worker's pay.
We can ensure there's no moreprofiting off the back ofseniors and when it comes tolong-term care.
Will the Prime Minister committo some of these guarantees?



The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

The liberal party will always stand up for the constitution ofcanada.
We respect areas ofjurisdiction.
But as I've said from the very beginning of this crisis, we will be there to help the provinces as they manage the challenges that they're facing.
The federal government does have role to play and it is a role to support the provinces in doing the things they need to do during this unprecedented time and we will continue to bethere.



The Prime Minister is no longer trying to hide behindjurisdiction.
We know in long-term care home, the for-profit care homes havebeen the site where the mostnumber of seniors have died.
Will the Prime Minister join us in committing to removing profitfrom the long-term care system, that vulnerable seniors shouldnot be the subject to theprofits of a company willing tocut services, staffing andquality of care and insteadensure seniors get the best carepossible?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Think it has become clear for all Canadians that we need to improve the care offered to our seniors right across thecountry.
That is something we cannot look at these numbers that we'reseeing and these tragedies hitting so many families and not want to see as a country us dobetter.
That's why we, of course, recognise we're going to work with other orders of government, particularly the provinces in whom their jurisdiction is to support answering these questions into the long term an dhow we improve the way thatcanada supports or elders and this is something really important that we will be therefor.
Mr. Singh.
(speaking french).



31 seniors were dehydrated and did not receive care and those who presented symptoms with COVID-19 were not isolated from others.
This spent $10, 000 a month to have their elderly in the centre and how can the prime minister think there's no role for the federal government to play to solve this devastating issue.
The right honourable Prime Minister.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Th. All Quebecois and Canadians were shocked to see the tragedy in the Orval long-term care homeand as a citizen, I was so happywhen Quebec took firm action andasked a lot of questions aboutthis issue and we are going to be there to support Quebec inits search for answers and mostimportantly to move forward inthe long term to better supportour seniors right across ourcountry.
We're going to continue now.



How many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose application shave been flagged as fraudulent?



The honourable Minister.



Thank you, chair.
I would like to remind people77% of people received this.



**Rosemary**:

I have pulled away from this round of COVID-19. We like to take the leader'sround, so the leaders questioning the Prime Minister, as we normally do in a regular time during question period.
and in a moment, will bring you some of the briefing fromdr.
Tan and cabinet ministers.
I know some of you miss that and like to see that and we'll start that just a moment, but we feelit's important to show you the accountability questions from the opposition parties when they are there in person.
I'll bring in My colleagues, Massey kapelos and davidcochran.
I found the Prime Minister Little chippy there with jagmeetsingh when there were questions around long-term care, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

Yes, the questions from the leader of the NDP Were all around long-term careand specifically what thefederal government's role inaddressing some issues that havebecome evident.
The Prime Minister was gettingsnippy about Quebec.
So this is an issue thatmr.
Ban charlotte, the leaderof the bloc quÉbÉcois has beentalking.
Even though provinces havejurisdiction over long-termcare, what exactly is thefederal government prepared doand that's what jagmeet singhkept pushing and when the Prime Minister responded, at first --I don't want to quote exactly --but he made light of or made funof the NDP's misfortune, theelectoral misfortune, I'll callit.



**Rosemary**:

That's a good way of putting it. [ laughter ]



**Vassy**:

In Quebec, specifically, and insinuated or accused jag meet Singh of not understanding or respecting the constitution and insisted the liberals do. By that, he meant the areas ofjurisdictions, the jurisdictional differences between the federal government and the provisional government where long-term care isconcerned.
The NDP's point is there isstill a lot happening in thesehomes and what will you do aboutit.
and not specific answersprovided there and it followedup about other than we care andwe've sent in the military andwe acknowledge there's aproblem.
But still, a deference tojurisdiction.



**Rosemary**:

It will be debate and there will have to be this uncomfortable conversation around long-term care, whetherwe're respecting theconstitution or not, there willbe some sort of conversationabout how that is divided up andwhat the federal government'srole should be. David, Andrew Scheer had a lotof questions around fraud of thecerb.



**David**:

It was anything on the jurisdictional question, how many times have we heardchrystia Freeland squabble aboutthis.
Most likely, Rosie, because this is a big Quebec issue right no wand always an issue in dealing wit Quebec government.
The CERB, what you're seeing in that and in blanchet's question sand the issues raised by theNDP is that the roll-outphase and the programme-designphase is largely done.
We have seen a lot of the bigaid programs rolled out now by the Prime Minister and ministersand now it's the pulling apartof these programmes and pointingto the flaws, who is gettingexcluded and as Andrew scheersaid, who is linking the factthat 200, 000 of the 7.7 millionreceiving CERB, accounts flagsas unequalifying where there arebusinesses and others who arenot qualifying and following therules.
This will be a challenge tomanage.
We talked about the problem inrolling out national policy thisrapidly will lead to problems.
The 200, 000, potentially, according to the memo that thenational post has seen aregetting payments that they don'tnecessarily qualify for or theyflat out are trying to ri offthe government to get extracash.
There is a promise they'll becaught afterwards because thisis all reconciled at tax timeand people will be forced to payback.
It will be interesting whetherthat will satisfy the governmentas a punishment, whether thereshould be fines on top of that.
That's a question for anotherday.



**Rosemary**:

David Cochran andvassy kapelos the prime minister mentioning you'll be directed TA job bank to make suggestions if you are looking for work as astudent.
Let's bring in the daily briefing from federal cabinet ministers and public health officials giving an update on the response to COVID-19 and this is it from the beginning.
Dr. Theresa tam.



I'll start with the latest numbers of COVID-19 numbers incanada.
There are now 71, 486 confirmedcases, including 5, 209 deaths.
and 34, 496 or 48% of cases have now recovered.
The labs across Canada tested over 1, 169, 000 people forcovid-19 to date with about 6%of these testing positiveoverall.
We're now testing on average of26 to 28, 000 people daily and these numbers change quickly an dare updated regularly oncanada.
Ca/coronavirus.
Today Canada releasedinformation on excess deaths incanada.
Excess deaths is a measure ofthe additional deaths that haveoccurred over and above theexpected number based on trendsfor previous years.
It's an important way for us tounderstand the full impact of anextraordinary event likecovid-19 against expectedmortality.
(speaking french).



It is also a reminder that significant crisis like COVID-19can have health consequencesbeyond the illness itself suchas increased illness and deathassociated with mental healthissues, problematic substanceuse or delayed health seekingfor acute and chronic healthconditions.



COVID-19 can have consequences beyond the illness, such as an illness or death associated with mental healthissues, problematic substance abuse and chronic healthconditions.
The delays in seeking urgent care for health, life-threatening illnesses, light heart attacks or strokecan result in immediateincreases in death rates whiledelays in chronic disease canaffect medium and long-temillness and death rates.
Likewise, delayed or missedappointments for preventionvisits to maintain routinevaccinations increases the riskof the infectious diseaseoutbreaks in associated illnessand deaths.
So as we review these numbersthat tell us are the borderimpacts of COVID-19 on thehealth of Canadians, I amreminding everyone that it isvital to maintain health visitsfor yourself and family and thatincludes keeping health visitsfrom everything from preventionto vaccines to mental health andchronic disease management andnot getting life-threateninghealth and mental healthconcerns.
Healthcare providers haveimplemented a range ofprecautions to prevent thespread of COVID-19 and ensurepatient's safety.
This includes screening patientsbefore appointments, staggeringvisit times to maintain socialdistancing and in some casesmaking virtual appointmentsavailable.
So speak with your healthcareprovider to see what options areavailable for you and yourfamily to safely have yourhealth needs met.
Thank you.
Merci.

Now to My colleague.



Bonn jour.



Can you hear me?



Yes, very well.



Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm very pleased to be with you here today.
(speaking french).



As you all know very well, the month of may is when students across the country normally start summer jobs.
Unfortunately, these are not normal times and many student jobs are no longer available due to COVID-19, which presents unique set of challenges to young Canadians.



We should be supported through this difficult times an don April 22nd, the Prime Minister announced a canadaemergency student benefit, direct support to students who are struggling to find work during the summer months and who are worried about paying bill sand tuition in the fall.
I'm happy to announce today, starting this Friday, may 15th, student can apply through the Canada revenue agencies to help manage the volume of applications, applicants will be asked to apply over four days, like we did with the CERB, depending on their month of birth and can expect their payment in three to five business days from when they are deemed eligible ifthey're using direct deposit.
In you're a student and never filed a tax return, you'll need to call the Cara to activate your social number to apply for theses and you'll be able to setup a My account to apply for the benefit this Friday.
The website will be going live today with clear details on who is eligible and what canadiansneed to know in order to apply when the application processbegins.
(speaking french).



The cesb will be available from may to August to student sand to recent graduates who are not receiving the canadaemergency response benefit and who are seeking work but unable to find it because of COVID-19.



It's for Canadian students abroad and high school graduates studying a programme in the coming months.
Through this benefit, eligible students will receive $1, 250 per month there may to August of2020 or $2, 000 a month for students with disabilities or students with dependents.
This money will not have to be paid back.
Just like the CERB, students can make up to a thousand dollars over the four-week period forwhich they are applying.
(speaking french).



The cesb will be available to one million full-time andpart-time students.



We are committed to allcanadians, including thecanadians who need it most.
Through measures like the cesbwill do what it take.
Thank you.



Thank you, C.R.A. So we'll move on to question sand thank you, Minister.
This begin with the telephone.



**Operator**:

Our firstquestion, please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

My question is for minister qualtrough, regarding the benefits for students.
Two weeks ago when this was discussed and voted in the house of commons, opposition leader shad problems with the benefit sand they wanted some changes andthat's why the bill that was adopted was pretty vague and there was a promise that in theregulations, there would be some additional details.
You promised to the NDP That you would put it to $2, 000 for students who have children which you did, but you also promised to the conservative party that there would be a link between students and available jobs and to the bloc quÉbÉcois, you promised the amount of revenue they could keep before losing the benefit could be changed and could change from the thousand dollars that was first decided.
So I don't see in what you'reannouncing today any indication that you fulfill your promise and that you listen to the opposition parties.
Can you be more specific aboutthat?



Well, thank you for thequestions.
It's super important to clarify and maybe I'll go quickly through each of them.
With respect to the concerns that we have direct links to available work, it's actually right in the bill itself that we have to direct students to the job bank and in Quebec to thequebec's equivalent and we have to tell students where they can find work and what jobs areavailable.
With respect to the limit of income a student can earn right now by regulation, it's the same as a CERB.
But as I've said, as the situation we'll continue to talk on the CERB and student benefit as to how we can make it easier for people to transition back into their work and apologize -- I forget the thirdone.
What was the third?



The NDP, but you made therequest.



We worked really hard with the -- and thank you.
I think the point is, we worked collaboratively on this and by giving regulatory flexibility in this act, we can continue to respond quickly without having to go back to change the lawitself.



About the $1, 000 of revenues that a student could keep, which is the same as for someone getting the CERB, are you saying that that could change in the near future? is that what I should take away from what you're saying?



I wouldn't say the nearfuture.
I would say as we look as government and as we head into recovery and provinces open up their economies, there is regulatory flexibility in both cases for the CERB and student benefit to monitor the situation and change accordingly as itevolves, but no, it would be premature to say that is coming any time soon.



Thank you.



Thank you, Merci.
Our next question is from thecanadian press.
Please go ahead.
Please un-mute your line.

---

**Question**:

Yes, thank you.
We're interested in knowing about testing and now that officials have an approved antibody test, what precisely do they plan to do with it in terms of public testing since the science on COVID-19 immunologyisn't quite settled yet?



This is Theresa Tam and I'llanswer this question.
So yes, health Canada authorized the cell of the first sirologictest, a test for usual antibodies or your antibodies to the virus itself.
and so, as you correctly pointedout, we don't know enough about the immunology of COVID-19 and these tests in general, tests for antibodies appear days or weeks after the infection.
So it's a look at what the proportion of the population has been infected, for instance.
The approach that we're taking in Canada is to use these tests, first of all, in the context of our population studies.
So the immunity task force that was formed a sort while ago has been active in trying to accelerate and prioritize these tests so that we can use them to determine across the population an estimation of how manycanadians are infected indifferent places or different age groups or in different riskpopulations, for instance.
That won't be the first key use.
and at the same time, together with recordings, organization sand funds such as the canadianinstitute for health research, we have to study the immunology, the immune response to the virus at the same time and then we can interpret these tests as to what they mean for an individual.
So it a little premature to be able to use these tests and interpret them on that basis.
From a population level, these tests will be used in conjunction with the OCR tests to look at how they can be incorporated then into a wider testing strategy, but right now, under the collaboration of the immunity task force, our priority is focusing on the population survey and also to understand there are designs of these studies over time, as well, to look across at leasttwo-year time span to see howthe population changes in termsof the antibody response.
That would give us even moreinformation about how effectiveare these antibodies protectingsomeone against, maybe a secondencounter against the virus andhow long does immunity last for.
I think it's great that the testwas authorized.
I also feel we are benefitingfrom some of the informationcoming from other countries, where they have had someexperience with sirologytesting.
Some of the tests didn't performvery well and we're learningfrom that experience, as well.



Thank you.
I'm not sure who is best to answer this one, but once the economy starts to reopen and more people without sick-leavebenefits are going to bereturning to work, as you know.
What will the government's rolebe in making sure they stay homewhen sick without penalized fordoing that?



I'm happy to weigh this on this one.
So we're very aware that a key component to our return-to-worksafely and positioningbusinesses and workers to feelconfident they can go back towork will be making it easier tostay home if you're feeling sickor if you're not well or ifyou're worried about having beenexposed to COVID-19 and we'reworking actively with theprovinces.
I know this is the discussionthat's happening between thepremiers and the Prime Minister, to see how we can help.
As you know right now, under thecerb if you're sick or if you'requarantined, of course, you canaccess the CERB and we'll lookto see how we can continue tosupport Canadians moving forwardand in what way we can best dothat.



**Operator**:

The last question on the phone.
(speaking french).



**Operator**:

Question from press Canada.

---

**Question**:

My question is for minister qualtrough and if you can answer in french, that would be greatly appreciated.
Could you please tell us in practical terms how you're going to match students with the available jobs? what is the federal government going do precisely to fulfill this promise made to theconservatives?



**Answer**:

Thank you.
That's a very importantquestion.
We certainly don't want to do anything to dissuade people from going back to work and forstudents, there will beopportunities, we believe, to work across the country thissummer.
So one of the measures we'vecreated was an additional 1, 600jobs across Canada.
When we created the application for the cesb, we also told students about the job bank.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to say it in french.
It's an opportunity that shows all of the available jobs.



It helps them to become connected with employers.
(speaking french).



Essentially, what we're going to do is that we've created portal showing the various job offerings and in the context of the cesb, those who wish to apply first will have to go through the job portal and therefore see what jobs are available in their own region sand that's what Carla has just explained to you.

---

**Question**:

If I correctlyunderstood, there won't be any obligation on the student'spart.
They will be able to benefit from the information but will not be forced to apply for a job and have it refused, have their application rejected before threat can apply for the cesb.
Can you explain because the students finish school at different times, I imagine this is for students who have only finished university, because others have not yet finishedschool.
C.R.A. please un-mute yourself.



**Answer**:

I'm sorry, it depends when you finish yourstudies, indeed.
So for students who are still in high school, it will be available for only two months, but for post secondary students, it be available for four months.
We're not going to force students to accept a certainjob, a specific job, but they have to affirm and attest in their applications that they are actively seeking employment and that they're not refusing any jobs and that they're actively seeking employment.



**Rosemary**:

We'll pull away from this federal briefing herewith cabinet ministers and federal public health officials.
Other details there about the student aid that will become available as of Friday and you will when you apply for that aid when you're a student for $1215or more be directed to a jobbank, where you can look at also jobs that are available if you want one.
But the Minister making it clear they will not force you to take job, but you will have to attest you are looking for ajob.
You will get four months of support of if you're university student and two months if you're a high school student because in principle, you're still in class.
So important details for lots of students looking for additionalhelp.
The whole class of 2020, actually, having a hard time because many of them are not going to get their traditional prom this year, their bigyear-end party, but they won'tmiss out all together.
This year's high school gradsare turning to virtual promsduring this pandemic and rayduff is a high school senior atthe academy for the arts andthey're on a cool committeecalled the prom is on, 2020.
It's a virtual prom that allhigh school student seniors incanada can join and they bothjoin us now from their homes.
Hi to you both and good to seeyou.



Good to see you.



Hi.



**Rosemary**:

Ray, I'll start with you and so you have noprom.
There's nothing to do and who came up with this idea and why did you guys DEC
