# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

I want to turn to what we're doing to help employers keep their employees.
Over the past few weeks, our government has unveiled a number of measures to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis.
We want to make sure as many Canadians as possible can keep getting their paycheque now and have a job to come back to once the pandemic is behind us. Because that day will come.
When it does, Canada needs to be ready.
Our government has been laying the groundwork for our economic recovery.
and we know that key to our collective success is maintaining the connection between employer and employee.
We launched the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
We also introduced the Canada emergency business account to support those struggling with cash flow.
These measures are making a real difference in people's lives.
So far more than half a million small businesses have received a loan through the Cebu and over 120, 000 employer have be ens approved to receive the Canada emergency wage subsidy for almost two million workers.
We targeted support for regional businesses, including those operating in the tourism sector and seasonal industries.
We created a nearly $1 billion regional relief and recovery fund to ensure that they're also getting the support during this time.
The fund willing flow through the six regional agencies with a proportion dedicated to the community futures network to assist businesses in rural and remote regions.
Today, we're releasing more details on how that money will be split between the Atlantic Canada opportunities agency, Canada economic development for Quebec regions, western economic diversification Canada and cannorth.
and here's the bottom line -- these organisations understand the economic realities and specific challenges facing both your region and your business.
They can help you with your most pressing needs.
Whether it's covering costs or keeping your employees.
If you are struggling but did not qualify for other programmes like the wage subsidy or the emergency business account, give them a call.
They're there for you.




**Interpreter**:

a few weeks ago, we created the regional relief and recovery fund with an envelope of almost $1 billion to help small employers in rural areas or those working in the tourism or seasonal industries.
The money will flow through our six regional agencies.
Part of the funding will also be dedicated to the community futures network to support businesses in the regions.
Today we're providing more details regarding the distribution of the funds between the various regions.
Whether it is fed Devi Ontario, Decca or the community futures network, these entities understand the economic realities and the specific challenges facing your region and your business.
They can help you to respond to your most urgent needs, whether it's problems with liquidity or your inability to keep your employees.
So, give them a call.
They're there for you.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From the outset, our government has been focused on getting people the help they need, as quickly as possible.
We announced support not just for employee, but different groups of people who have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
a few weeks ago, we launched the Canada emergency student benefit as part of our $9 billion plan to help young people get through the next few months.
and today, I can confirm that students and recent graduates will be able to apply for this benefit starting Friday.
To prepare for that, if you haven't already signed up for the My account on the C.R.A. Website, it's worth doing this now to make the next steps go even quicker.




**Interpreter**:

I also have some news for students and recent graduates this morning.
Starting on Friday, you can apply to receive the Canada emergency student benefit.
This new benefit is part of our $9 billion plan to help you get through this pandemic.
Because of COVID-19, there are not as many jobs for students this summer.
and you need to work during the next few months in order to pay your tuition or your daily expenses for the year to come.
The Canada emergency student benefit will be there to help you.
You can apply starting on Friday.
But in the meantime, do go to the C.R.A. Website to register under My account, if you haven't done so alreadyl right.
That will accelerate things even more.
I want to close this morning by reminding everyone to continue to follow the recommendations of our public health experts.
We are hearing a lot about the gradual re-opening of the economy these days and I know we're all anxious to see that happen but we must remain vigilant.
So, continue to stay home as much as possible.
and don't forget to keep a safe distance when you go out and, together, we will get through this.



Merci.beaucoup.
