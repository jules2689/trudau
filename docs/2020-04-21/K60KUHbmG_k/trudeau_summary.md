Charities and nonprofit organisations were doing crucial work to help our communities.
Their mission has always been to support people in their time of need and that hasn't changed.
But COVID-19 is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on those organisations because more people need help.
Back in March, one United Way partner in Winnipeg made and distributed 1475 emergency kits for families, seniors and homeless people in just five days.
That is no longer possible because of COVID-19 so organisations are now delivering meals and providing support via phone.
In Toronto, Tropicana community services is now helping vulnerable youth access their COVID-19 benefits.
S, resources these groups don't have because they're spread so thin trying to help as many people as possible.
So to support charities and nonprofits in their important work, our government is setting up a $350 million emergency community support fund.
a portion of these funds will go directly to smaller, independent front line organisations and the rest will flow through national organisations like the United Way community foundations Canada and the red cross that can get funds to local organisations and vulnerable people quickly.
This is money for things like training volunteers, increasing at-home deliveries for seniors or driving people with disabilities to appointments.
With this fund, we're giving more resources to charities and nonprofits so they can adapt to the new realities and difficulties brought on by this pandemic.




is also helping business owners and entrepreneurs adapt to a new reality with the Canada emergency wage subsidy.
This new measure gives qualifying employers up to $847 per employee each week so they can keep people on the payroll.
So a few weeks ago, the digital technology supercluster challenged its network of over 500 firms to come up with solutions to help Canadians get through this pandemic.
Toronto's DNA Stack is developing a new cloud-based network that allows researchers who are looking to improve our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19 to share their findings.
Another company, foodex, is working with its partners to develop an e-grocery management system to make sure our health care workers, seniors and others have access to fresh food during this crisis.
Canadian innovators are among the best in the world and it is great to see so many of them use their talents to help our communities.
