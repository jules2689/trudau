### Summary:



The first thing I want to talk about today is what we're doing to support indigenous people during the pandemic.
We're investing in emergency shelters to help indigenous women and children flee violence and offering interest-free loansand nonrepayable institutionsand helping first nations andmetis students and recent gradsfind a job this summer.
and last week we announced morefunding to support the mosturgent needs of indigenouscommunities dealing with thecovid-19 outbreak.
We must adapt our approach andour programs to recognise andmeet the particular needs of allindigenous peoples, includingthose living in urban areas andoff reserve.
To this end, we announced$15 million back in March tosupport indigenous organizationsthat deliver services thesepopulations as a part of theindigenous community supportfund we set up to help preventand mitigate the impact of thisvirus.
With this money, organizationshave been able to give meals, groceries, clothing and suppliesto those in need and offermental health counseling.
Indigenous communityorganizations in our city andoff reserve do crucial work yearround, but these days theirservices are in high demandbecause of the pandemic.
We need to make sure they havethe resources to adapt and growtheir services so they canfulfill their important mission.
So today, our government isannouncing an additional$75 million in new funding fororganizations that address thecritical needs of the over onemillion indigenous people livingin urban centres and offreserve.
