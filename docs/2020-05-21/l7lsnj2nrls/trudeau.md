# PM Trudeau Speech



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

The first thing I want to talk about today is what we're doing to support indigenous people during the pandemic.
Since day one, our government has been engaging with firstnations, Inuit and met is nation leaders in the fight against invirus.
We've been listening to people'sconcerns and working with leadership leadership to en sureecommunities are getting the right support.
We're investing in emergency shelters to help indigenous women and children flee violence and offering interest-free loansand nonrepayable institutionsand helping first nations andmetis students and recent gradsfind a job this summer.
and last week we announced morefunding to support the mosturgent needs of indigenouscommunities dealing with thecovid-19 outbreak.
While all communities have hadto wrestle with COVID-19 thesepast few months, the every-dayrelate realities of thisrealities are different foreveryone.
We must adapt our approach andour programs to recognise andmeet the particular needs of allindigenous peoples, includingthose living in urban areas andoff reserve.
To this end, we announced$15 million back in March tosupport indigenous organizationsthat deliver services thesepopulations as a part of theindigenous community supportfund we set up to help preventand mitigate the impact of thisvirus.
With this money, organizationshave been able to give meals, groceries, clothing and suppliesto those in need and offermental health counseling.
They've provided personalprotective equipment andcleaning supplies for supportivehousing and computer and laptopsso kids can keep up with theirschoolwork.
This is helping vulnerablepeople like youth, women andelders.
Indigenous communityorganizations in our city andoff reserve do crucial work yearround, but these days theirservices are in high demandbecause of the pandemic.
We need to make sure they havethe resources to adapt and growtheir services so they canfulfill their important mission.
So today, our government isannouncing an additional$75 million in new funding fororganizations that address thecritical needs of the over onemillion indigenous people livingin urban centres and offreserve.
This is critical work.
If you live off reserve or in acity, we're working to make surethat you don't full through thecracks.
You need and deserve servicesthat are culturally appropriateand that's what we're doing withtoday's investment.

Our government is announcing new investment of $75 million for organizations that address the most urgent needs of more than a million indigenous people living in urban centres or offreserve.
This is money that community organizations will be able to use to combat food insecurity, support vulnerable seniors, help young people at risk, provide mental health services and prevent family violence.
Now I would like to directly address employers and propertyowners.
We've been talking a lot about reopening the economy these day sand that's good news foreveryone.
But if you have had to slow down or stop your activity in recentmonths, reopening will also present certain challenges.
So we are putting measures in place to support you.
If you need help to rehire youremployees, you can use the emergency wage subsidy.
We have just extended thatprogramme until the end of thesummer.
If you're experiencing liquidityproblems, you can receive a loan through the emergency businessaccount.
If you're not eligible for those two programmes, we invite you to address or go directly to your regional development agency.
They will be able to help you.
We are also working with theprovinces, the territories and the property owners and their tenants to try to lower rents for small businesses.
Owners can up lie starting onmonday on the website of thecanada mortgage and housingagency.
We're all anxious to see life return to normal, but in order for that to happen, everyone must do their part and employers in particular have an important role to play.
When people are thinking of returning to normalcy, one of the first things that comes to mind is going back to work andit's about finding financialstability, seeing their colleagues and friends again and getting back into their routine.
Your employees are counting onyou, your community, as well.
So if you need help but you'renot sure where to start, pleas ego to Canada.
Ca and consult thecovid-19 page.
There you will find more information about all theprogrammes available to you anddidn't how to go about gettingsupport.
We are preparing to restart our economy and I know that together we can come back strong once the crisis is over.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

As we gradually and carefully restart some activities, it'snever been more important to follow public healthinstructions.
COVID-19 remains a very serious health threat.
Yesterday, Dr. Tam said that whenever physical distancing is not possible, Canadians should wear a non medical mask or face covering when they go out.
I want to remind everyone that physical distancing means keeping a two-metre distancewith others.
As we start to reopen theeconomy, it might be moredifficult to maintain thatdistance at all times, soplease, follow Dr. Tam's advice, keep washing your hands, stayhome and if you need to, wear amask.
This is the best way to protectboth yourself and others.
