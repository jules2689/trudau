### Summary:



From coast to coast to coast, there are Canadians working long hours to keep each other safe and keep our country moving.
But for everyone pouting in an extra shift right now, there's someone else who wants to work, but can't.
Maybe you still have a job, but aren't sure if employer is going to keep you around next month.
Earlier this month, we introduced the Canada emergency wage subsidy to help protoekts your job or help you get back to work.
Employers can now submit a claim for the Canada emergency wage subsidy through the Canada revenue agency.
But thanks to the wage six did, they can keep their employees ton payroll and keep teaching kids about nature. That gives you a sense of just how many people this programme will help.
Right across the country, it is going to keep businesses and workers connected.
En is that gives people certainly that they have a job now and in the month to come to support themselves and their family and means employers not only have support through the tough time, but they will be able to gear back up when things get better.
More importantly, we all know people who work there.
If your employer can't hire you back, if you're a seasonal worker, if you can't find a job right now, the Canada emergency response benefit is there for you.
and if you need the help again for the coming month, go online and reconfirm that you're still eligible.
I want to remind everyone, you won't be able to keep both the wage subsidy and the CERB.
Right now we're working with the other parties on legislation to get this help flowing.
and if you are an essential worker, you deserve to be paid properly for your incredible work.
Ontario came out with their plan over the weekend and we're working with them to provide the support they need to deliver results.
and we're currently in discussion with all the other provinces and territories to get their plans for essential workers in place.
and no matter where you live, you need to continue following the recommendations from public health officials that will keep everyone safe.
