# PM Trudeau Speech



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

From coast to coast to coast, there are Canadians working long hours to keep each other safe and keep our country moving.
But for everyone pouting in an extra shift right now, there's someone else who wants to work, but can't. Maybe you've been laid off because of the pandemic.
Maybe you still have a job, but aren't sure if employer is going to keep you around next month.
Whatever your situation may be, we're in your corner.
Earlier this month, we introduced the Canada emergency wage subsidy to help protoekts your job or help you get back to work.
and as of this morning, applications for this programme have opened.
Employers can now submit a claim for the Canada emergency wage subsidy through the Canada revenue agency.
To access the 75% wage subsidy for your employees, go online through Canada.
Ca to reach this portal.
Whether you're a charity that employs 200 people or fast-growing startups that employ just 20, you will be eligible for up to $847 per week per employee.
You can expect to see this money soon.
Make sure you register for direct deposit to get your money quickly.
The first payments should begin to arrive on May 7. Because of COVID-19, a charity from guelph would have been forced to lay off all of their staff.
But thanks to the wage six did, they can keep their employees ton payroll and keep teaching kids about nature.
and there are so many more stories just like this one.
There have been over 300, 000 view of the online calculate to that we launched last week to help businesses prepare a kla*im. and since the portal opened at 6:00 AM this morning, almost 10, 000 businesses have already applied for it. That gives you a sense of just how many people this programme will help.
Right across the country, it is going to keep businesses and workers connected.
En is that gives people certainly that they have a job now and in the month to come to support themselves and their family and means employers not only have support through the tough time, but they will be able to gear back up when things get better.
We all know a local salon or a gym that's had to close and a neighbourhood restaurant or shop that's really struggling.
More importantly, we all know people who work there.
They deserve a hand to get through this and that is what the wage subsidy is for.

**Interpreter**:

Starting this morning, employers are able to apply to receive the emergency wage subsidy on the Canada revenue website.
You will find the portal online at Canada.
Ca and there you can apply for your 75% six did.
-- subsidy.
Whether you're running a charity that employs 200 people or a startup that employs 20 people, you can now receive up to $847 per employee every week and this is money that you will be receiving soon.
The revenue agency has been working with financial institutions to ensure that you can quickly receive your payments.
If you opt for direct deposit with the first payments backing available on May 7. Since 6:00 AM, almost 10, 000 businesses have already applied.
This subsidy will help many people keep their job during this crisis.
Around it will also help employers to quickly start up their activities again once the crisis has ended.
All of us have, in our neighbourhood, ao*et area hair salon or gym that has had to shut down or a neighbourhood restaurant or small boutique that is having trouble and we all know people who work in those places.
They deserve a hand to get through this.
and that is the whole purpose of the wage subsidy.
But certainly a single programme cannot help everyone.
a government programme cannot hire you if you are a seasonal worker or cannot find a job right now, we will help you.
You have probably already received your first monthly check for the emergency benefit.
If you need one next month, you simply have to go online and confirm that you are still eligible.
But remember, you cannot keep both the wage subsidy and the emergency benefit.
It is one or the other, not both.
Now we are working with other parties now to pass legislation that will allow us to introduce the measures that we have developed for students.
We will be continuing this work in parliament and our first virtual session will take place tomorrow with an in-person session on Wednesday.
At the same time, we will also be giving the provinces and territories the funding they need to top up the wages of essential workers.
They're doing an amazing job and they deserve to be fairly compensated.



**Prime Minister Trudeau**:

People are facing different challenges right now and no single programme can reach everyone.
So we're coming at this from every angle.
If your employer can't hire you back, if you're a seasonal worker, if you can't find a job right now, the Canada emergency response benefit is there for you.
You've probably already received your first cheque.
and if you need the help again for the coming month, go online and reconfirm that you're still eligible.
I want to remind everyone, you won't be able to keep both the wage subsidy and the CERB.
It's one or the other.
Not both.
If you're a student, there's support for you, too.
Right now we're working with the other parties on legislation to get this help flowing.
Parliament will have its first virtual sitting tomorrow and in-person sitting on Wednesday.
and if you are an essential worker, you deserve to be paid properly for your incredible work.
Our government is doing its part to make that happen.
Ontario came out with their plan over the weekend and we're working with them to provide the support they need to deliver results.
and we're currently in discussion with all the other provinces and territories to get their plans for essential workers in place.
I'll have more updates for across the country in the coming days.
As I said Saturday, we're also collaborating on shared guidelines for re-opening the economy.
Once the time comes.
Different provinces and territories will be able to move at a different pace.
But we need clear, coordinated efforts from coast to coast to coast.
and no matter where you live, you need to continue following the recommendations from public health officials that will keep everyone safe.




**Interpreter**:

As I said, we're also working with the provinces and territories with a view to gradually re-opening the economy.
Every province and every territory has a different reality.
But we must work together to ensure the safety of all Canadians.
We are all very anxious to return to a normal life.
But we have to do that right, otherwise we risk losing all the progress we've made thus far.
So, you know what to do. Stay home.
Continue to wash your hands frequently.
and if you have to go out, keep a two-metre distance from you and others.
Every day, we get closer to the time when all of this will be behind us. We get closer to the time when we can all celebrate together.
But we are not there yet.
Let's persevere together, friends.
Thank you.
