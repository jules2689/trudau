**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Wet against COVID-19. We have to remember that the situation remains very serious.
We're not out of the woods yet.
As we move into the summer, we'll have to keep adjusting ourroutines.
Our cities will have to adjust and change and our approach will have to be tailored to eastcommunity.
That means the rules and public health recommendations you'reasked to follow may be different depending on where you live.
and that can be confusing.
But right across the country, one thing will stay the same.
Everyone has a responsibility tothemselvesand to people around them.
So keep practicing physicaldistancing.
This is how we protectourselves, protect our loved ones and protect the mostvulnerable.
Moving forward with reopening must happening gradually andcarefully.
and the right safeguards must be in place, including testing and contact tracing.
This is key to keeping us safe and keeping the situation undercontrol.
What reopening means for you and for your family will be different for everyone.
Just take the realities facing small business owners.
Some were ready to open their doors as soon as they get the green light it's safe to do so, but for many more, getting back on their feet will be challenge and one of the biggest concerns is paying rent.
That's why we created the canadaemergency commercial rent assistance programme.
This benefit will provide forgivable loans to landlords Southey can lower rent by 75% for small businesses hit hardest bycovid-19. and it will be available to nonprofit and charitableorganizations.
As of 8:00 this morning, applications have now opened.
If you're a landlord with up to ten eligible tenants and you'relocated in the Atlantic, British Columbia, Alberta or Quebec, you can apply today at cmhc.
Ca. For landlords in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and the territories who have up to ten eligible tenants, tomorrow is your day to apply.
Landlords with more than tenant swill be able to apply later thisweek.
To business owners, make sureyou're holding up your end of the bargain, as well.
The wage subsidy, which we'reextending through the summer can help you rehire your workers.
We're all in this together and together is how we'll get through it. (speaking french).

**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Had prosperity and growth in theircommunities.
To come out of this crisis, our country needs workers, people like you more than ever.
Our government knows that and we know that you deserve to be treated fairly on the job.
This is something I spoke with the leader of the NDP, jag meet Singh, about yesterday.
Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness or being able to pay their bills.
Just like nobody should have to choose between staying home withcovid-19 symptoms or being able to afford rent or groceries.
That's why the government will continue discussions with the provinces without delay on ensuring that as we enter the recovery phase of the pandemic, every worker in Canada who need sit has access to ten days of paid sick leave a year.
and we'll also consider other mechanisms for the longer term, to support workers with sickleave.
