**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
What is your explanation tocanadians today about why your wealthy political party is accepting taxpayer money during this crisis this the form of the wage subsidy?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

We know families across the country depend on the jobs that they do to pay groceries, pay for the rent and that's why we put in place a wage subsidy that is available to small businesses, large businesses, nonprofits and charities to be able to support people who might otherwise be laid off.
This will be an important part of the economy bouncing back andthat's what we're focused on.

**Question**:

When your government created the wage subsidy criteria, did you include the appears of your own would be applying forassistance?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

We know from the very beginning it would be important to ensure that people could keep their jobs whether they work in the private sector whether they work for nonprofits or charities to be able to support their families and to make sure that our economy can roar back as quickly as possible once we'rethrough the crisis phase of thatpandemic.
That's what we ensured was this place right across the economy and we encouraged economies to take on that because it is the best way to keep a link between workers and the job they do to ensure our economy comes back when this is all done.

**Question**:

Just to come back to what you talked about in your discussions with the problems about ten days of pay sick leave per year, can you tell us how this could work and what will the bill be for that.
?would it be employers paying tebill?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Thgasked and we are in discussions with the provinces to talk aboutthat.
We know that we're in a crisis where companies and employers do not have a huge amount of financial flexibility, so during this crisis, governments will have to take on more of theresponsibility.
But one of the things we'll have to think about over the longer term is that when we come out of this crisis, it might be a good idea to ensure that all workers, whatever their job may be across the country, have access to paid sick leave and we will be working with the private sector on that, as well.
But for now, we're discussing this with the provinces because this is a shared area ofjurisdiction.



**Operator**:

Follow-up.

**Question**:

So you might bring that in and when could it start, this summer, for example? I would like you to comment on the subsidies being used by the liberal party and other political parties.
People are perplexed about this.
Are you comfortable with this? are you comfortable with the idea of the liberal party and other parties using this emergency programme? that's the question.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Witquestion, we're looking at asituation, where in October ornovember, when people start to get colds and the winter is taking hold, we don't want to see people suddenly showing symptoms that could be COVID-19and having to say, well, shouldi hide My symptoms from myemployer because if they stayhome, they're going to use theirpaycheque and not going to be able to pay for their groceries.
and we know particularly in thissituation, ensuring that in thecoming months, when the recoveryhas taken hold, we will havethat kind of flexibility and be able to ensure the people whoshow symptoms of COVID-19 willhave the choice of staying homein order not to spread COVID-19 toothers and that's the work wehave to do to prevent thespread.
On your second question, thewage subsidy is there to allowpeople to keep that connectionto their job, whether they'reworking for a private company ora charity or another type oforganization.
So if people depend on their joband they want to continue tokeep that job and be able to goback when the economy hasrecovered, well, that's why webrought in the wage subsidy andmade it available to businessesbut also to nonprofit organizescharities.
(speaking french). 

[translator speaking]



Good morning, Mr. Trudeau, I would like to continue on that second topic, particular the wage subsidy use bid your partyyand the other political parties.
That has not been well thought of by other Canadians.
Now Mr. McKay and Mr. Ohmr.
O'toole say that's notright.
You and the liberal parties are using this and you're the liberal party leader.
Do you think the liberal party should not be using thatsubsidy?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

,waleadership race, in the conservative party, there are candidates that will be making various proposals and I do not generally comment on internal debates in other parties.
Now we introduced the wage subsidy in order to helpworkers, workers in private companies or in working for nonprofit corporations.
Their families depend on their cheques and in order for the recovery to be strong, we need people to keep that job attachment so that they can go back to their jobs when we'verecovered and that's why we created it.

---

**Question**:

With all duerespect, I'm not asking you to comment that but as the liberal leader of Canada, whether you want them to not make use of that subsidy and what do you think the Canadians who think you have millions of dollars in your coffers and you're taking advantage of a federal wage subsidy for companies that have no money.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

The country who depend on that job, who depend on their job and their salary to help their family and pay for their groceries and rent.
and we made the decision to ensure that waive subsidy would be accessible to businesses and nonprofit organizations.
That is the decision that will allow the economy to come back strong afterwards and I believe it was the right decision because we must be able to support Canadians whatever organization or company they work for.



**Operator**:

Last question on the phone.

**Question**:

Thank you.
From Stephanie livitiz, thecanadian press, the line isopen.

---

**Question**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Your government as well as provisional and local ones asking Canadians to make big sacrifices to curb the spread ofcovid-19 to give the healthcare system time to get ready.
When we look at procurementdata, it says you have obtained6% to 23% as the goods you set out to buy.
So I'm wondering if you have confidence that the system is, in fact, ready for a potential second wave.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Wefppe into Canada over the past weeks and we'll continue to receive flights almost every single day.
The amount of Poe we'reprocuring from international sources continues to increase.
While at the same time, we'reramping up domestic production like masks and gowns andventilators, the kinds of things that are actually necessary to handle that second wave.
We know there's lots more to do, but we have been delivering on the needs we're seeing right across the country.
(speaking french). 

[translator speaking] we know that the recovery will depend on having the necessary protective equipment for workers on thefrontline, but also workers in other industries and that's why we are pursuing our efforts to bring in and procure the necessary ppe.
We have already received some 40flights of Poe and we will be receiving more equipment soon and we are also ramping up our domestic production capacity so that we have enough protective equipment for a potential secondwave.

---

**Question**:

The follow-up ondifferent topics.
The information commissionerasked both you and thetreasuryboard to send a messagetthey need to be accountableduring the pandemic and why haveyou not delivered such amessage?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Wed openness with this government from the very beginning and every announcement I make, with every announcement the ministers make on help for Canadians, we've been transparent on the investments we're making as we move forward.
But we recognise there's always more to do in terms of openness and transparency and we will continue to demonstrate that with Canadians.
Because we know fundamentallythere's an issue of trust and ofconfidence.
If Canadians can continue to have confidence that their government is working hard forthem, they will know that continuing to follow public health recommendations, continuing to know that they'regoing to be support as we move through this pandemic will leave us all better off as we begin torecover.
(speaking french). 

[translator speaking]



We know openness and transparency are important to keep public trust.
When they know their governments are being open with them and openly talking about everythingthey're doing, they will haveconfidence, not only in their future but that the system will be there to protect them and then the economic recovery will be that much easier.

**Question**:

You said in your statement that the government is continuing discussions with the provinces on paid sick leave.
Where do those talks stand? do you think all of the of the provinces are on board with this and how do you see a national system for sick leave? how do you see that working?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Sit up a number of weeks ago on our first Minister's call bymr.
Horgan that pointed out when the fall comes and flu season comes up, we don't want people who develop a sniffle, well, they should not go into work but can't afford not to go into work and therefore, the risks contributing to a second wave could be a real problem.
That's why a number of premier shave agreed we do need to look at ways of encouraging people who begin to exhibit symptoms ofcovid-19, to able to stay home for a day or two, for the time necessary to be able to get themselves tested and possiblytreated.
These are things that will be essential in our recovery if we are to control the spread ofcovid-19. The mechanisms are challenging and that's why we have to work with the provinces.
We've put forward a number of mechanisms to support people who have lost their jobs because ofcovid-19 but the canadaemergency response benefit is doled out in chunks of four weeks and we recognise there ISS need for a shorter period oftime, so discussions with the provinces around paid sickleave, talking about ten days over the course of the year, could be significant help andthat's what we've agreed to lead with the provinces.
(speaking french)

[translator speaking] a coupleof weeks ago, premier Horgan ofbritish columbia pointed out itwould be important, particularlyin the fall, when the flu seasonstarts, that people who areexhibiting symptoms of COVID-19be able to stay home and notfeel obligated to go to workbecause they need pawn.
Money.
So the idea of providing sickleave, up to ten days of paidsick leave a year will requirethat we work with the provinces.
a couple of provinces areinterested because they realizethat it could be a problem ifpeople feel forced to go back towork even if they're ill.
So this is a conversation thatis ongoing and the mechanismswill have to be worked on withthem to figure out how that canwork.

**Question**:

You're promising federal support last week.
Have any provinces taken you upon that and how fast do we get testing numbers up and contact tracing numbers up?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

One of the challenges we're seeing right now is that the laboratory capacity is significant across the country to ramp up testing in a large way.
We need to improve uptake and we need to ensure a reliable swab sand reagents.
These are things that are elements of the ramping up oftesting.
We've seen provinces work close with us to ramp up their immediate testing capacity or else solidify their surge capacity because even though the numbers may be under control in their regions right now, they recognise that if a second wavehits, they need to respond quickly and that's what we'reensuring they'll able to do. 

[translator speaking]



We know testing and contact tracing are essential to reopening the economy and that'swhy we're working with the various problems to make sure we have the necessary capacity, including in our laboratories but in terms of personal protective equipment and the ability to do the testing.
Now some provinces currently have the virus under control, but they need to be able to respond quickly if there's resurgence of the virus andthat's what we're providingthen.

---

**Question**:

I'm with globalnews.
I'm wondering how concerned you may be with the mixed messages of wearing masks, the virus itself and with businesses reopening and thing reopening, especially like regards totoronto, trinity bell wood park.
What are your thoughts?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Think Canadians have demonstrated over these past two months just how serious we all are about ensuring that we slow the spread of COVID-19, that we get this virus under control.
I think it is natural as we begin to see the economyreopening, for people to be confused about what it is they can do and what it is theyshouldn't do. That's why we're going to continue to impress upon people the importance of making smart decisions of wearing a mask where physical distance isimpossible, of ensuring that at all times you're keeping two metres apart from other people.
There will need to be adjustments moving forward.
Different cities may have to bring in different rules to make things happen.
But ultimately, we have to be in this together.
We have to keep our frontlineworkers safe and we do not want to see a resurgence of the virus and we do not want our healthcare systems overloaded.
We have demonstrated ascanadians we can do this and we have to remain vigilant because we have to be careful throughout the coming months.


[translator speaking]



We know that we are currently in a good situation as a country because Canadians followed therecommendations.
Generally speaking, they have been keeping their distance of two metres from others and have stayed home.
As the economy starts to reopen and the weather is gettingbetter, people will want to domore, but they'll have to be very careful and continue to keep two metre's distance fromothers.
Some municipalities and some locations will have to adjust their rules to ensure that wedon't see a resurgence ofcovid-19. But I know that Canadians want to do the right thing and they want to protect their friend sand their loved ones and are healthcare workers.
So we will all have to remain very vigilant and follow the public health advice and keep ourselves and others healthy.

**Question**:

Given china'sproposed national security Lawson Hong Kong, other than voicingconcerns, what can Canada do practically to encourage the protection of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Wegstatement with a number of our allies of real concern for the situation in Hong Kong.
I think it's important to support the citizens of hongkong, including 300, 000canadians, who really want to see the one country, twosystems' approach to Hong kongand china continue.
It is going to be important for the Chinese government to engage in constructive conversations with citizens of Hong Kong, to ensure that we deescalate the tensions and we look forward TA path for prosperity in a way that the citizens of Hong kongexpect.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, last Friday, the United Kingdom government said that it would be further reviewing huawei's involvement in the network and phasing it out by 2023, leaving Canada, the last of the five eyes, to make decision on huawei'sinvolvement.
Are you still considering their involvement in the 5g network and when can we expect adecision?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

On this decision, we have been taking advice from our security officials and we have been working with them to ensure what is the right path forward forcanada and we're working closely with our allies and watching what they do to make sure that we are all doing the things necessary to both create economic opportunities and growth for our country while making sure that safety and security of or infrastructures, our businesses and people aretantamount.


[translator speaking]



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

we will continue to work with our intelligence agencies with respect to the 5g network and making the right decisions for the country and for canadiansand for our institutions, ofcourse, in on consultation wit hour allies.

**Question**:

Given the focus oncoronavirus, how will your government advance legislation on gun control or assisted dying which is up for a court-orderedreview?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Obs throughout the government on important noncovid priorities.
But right now, in parliament, the focus needs to be on this crisis that has taken over almost every aspect ofcanadian's lives and of oureconomy.
We will continue to work to address the needs that canadiansface both through this health crisis and into the economic challenges as we begin to recover from this COVID-19crisis.
It's important that we haveparliaments and institutionsthat function well and that'swhat we are continuing todemonstrate.


[translator speaking]



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

We have a government that continues to work on many different issue snot connected to COVID-19, but the priority in parliament andcanadians is really to ensure that our response to thiscrisis, whether it's in terms of healthcare or in terms of our potential economic recovery, obviously, there's a lot of debate to be had on that andthat's what we will continue todo and emphasize in parliament.
I'd like to come back to theten-days of paid sick leave.

---

**Question**:

Would it be only if an individual is afraid that they might have COVID-19 or infected or tests positive forcovid? and also, what about the bill, will that probably be shared with the provinces and how much do you think it will cost the federal government?



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

Wee ongoing at this time with theprovinces, but the concept is really quite simple.
If someone shows symptoms of the flu or COVID-19 and doesn't know which one it is, that person should not feel obligated to go to work in order to support their family.
We want to remove that vector of transmission that will occur if people in jobs, particularly inlow-paid jobs, feel that theyhave go to work even though theyhave symptoms of COVID-19. and it's a challenge, not just atheoretical challenge for asociety that has to look afterthe most vulnerable, but it isactually a concrete challenge inthe midst of this crisis.
We don't want people to go backto work when they're sick.
and in order to prevent thatfrom happening, we're preparedto work with the provinces toput in place the paid sick leaveprogramme.
As for the bill, the cost, well, we'll have to work on that andto determine that, but thepurpose is very clear.
We don't want people to feelforced to go into work if theyhave symptoms of COVID-19. But if someone has an injury onthe leg, for example, itwouldn't apply.
What about the wage subsidy.
Are you aware of the negativeimpact or the negativeconnotation that this has oncanadians when they see thatpolitical parties are using thissubsidy? do you realize that people arevery upset about this? ? there are businesses out there, small and large and nonprofit organizations and charities all employing Canadians and thosecanadians depend on theirpaycheques to support their families and go and get theirgroceries.
So we need to ensure that our economy can recover andtherefore, we introduced a wage subsidy to help workers from all different types of industries so that the economy can come back strong afterwards.
So this is important forcanadians that there be a strong economic recovery and the wage'ssubsidy is a part of thesolution.



**Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau**:

We have put in place a system to ensure that people can stay connected to their jobs and so that they can continue to support their families and pay their bills while continuing to work for organizations that otherwise might have to laypeople off.
It's there for small businesses.
It's there for big businesses and it's there for nonprofits.
It's there for the charitable sector and this is something that will be important for the economy to come back and that'swhy we put in place the wagesubsidy.
(speaking french).
