### Summary:


We, therefore, both reached out to suppliers of medical products that Canada has long worked with around the world, as well as seen unprecedented efforts by Canadian industry to deliver ventilators that would be made in Canada.
I can assure people that the approach is working.



We recognize the triple challenges faced by workers in the energy sector right now that has been extraordinarily difficult for people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
That is why we moved quickly on two measures to help as many people as we could across the country, the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy at 75%.



From the beginning, Mr. Speaker, we worked with all agencies to ensure that the relevant information was shared across departments.



a number of people in this house, we are extremely pleased with the level of collaboration, with input from all parliamentarians and all parties as we look to ensure that we're helping Canadians as much as possible in this situation.
We've moved forward on a wage subsidy, we've moved forward on a Canada emergency response benefit, we've moved forward on low-interest loans, of which 25%, $10, 000, will be forgivablefor small businesses.
We recognize there's more to do and we look forward to continue to work with all parliamentarians to make sure we're helping Canadians in all ways.
We have strict rules around quarantine and foreign workers arriving in Canada have to be isolated for 14 days in an adequate manner to ensure that they do not spread the COVID-19 virus.
We will work together to make sure while meeting the needs of our farmers and our food supply chain, we do have the capacity and the certainty that canadiansare kept safe and that the possible spread of COVID-19 is limited.
It's important to support workers and families going through a tough time in all industries all across the country, including the oil patch.



The immediate urgency in this situation was making sure that people across the country who were reliant on pay cheques to be able to pay their groceries and pay their rent, pay cheques that suddenly disappeared because of COVID-19 get Manitoba quickly.
I want to take a moment to thank the extraordinary public servants at revenue Canada, but also across ministries and departments who worked incredibly hard to create a model that would get money out quickly to millions of Canadians.
We of course recognize there are gaps and are working with all parliamentarians to fill those gaps because people who need help should be getting it. We've moved forward with another program we're debating here today on wage subsidies for people so they can keep their jobs, keep their pay cheques at 75% subsidy from the government.
But we recognize there are other people in different situations who also need help, students, seniors, part-time workers, essential workers who need extrahelp to keep their jobs.
We know that there are more that the banks can do and we've been working with banks and credit unions to make sure they do more to recognize that the way we support Canadians through this situation will ensure that we come out of this situation in the best-possible shape, all of us.
That is why we made sure that the big measures we put forward are entirely focused on Canadians, on workers.
The Canada emergency response benefit helps people who've lost their job because of COVID-19. The wage subsidy makes sure that people stay connected to their jobs even though they can't get paid by their employer anymore because the government will pay them up to 75% of their salary, so that when this is through, Canadians will still have connection to those jobs and our economy can get going again.
