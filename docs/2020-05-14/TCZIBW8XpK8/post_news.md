# News after the Speech



**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada on this Thursday giving us an update on the response to the pandemic.
Today the focus on fish harvesters, primarily, who were waiting for details after an announcement around fish processing plants about a week ago.
and some additional news that we already talked about, the national parks will re-open as of June 1. I'll bring in My colleagues Vassy kapelos and catherine cullen for initial thoughts on what we heard there.
I thought the first question tom parry asked, our colleague, was interesting because it allowed the Prime Minister to reflect a little bit on the fact that it is difficult for us to return to whatever this new normal is and the government's job is to try and minimize risk.
You don't have to talk about that, but I just thought it was interesting to hear him reflect on how you make those decisions as a government.



**Vassy**:

and it follows, I think what we've been hearing from premiers as well and it's sort of almost like listening to the internal discussions in their heads, right? and during day, I listened to all the various premiers and right now they're all sort of rolling out how they envision the economy looking, society looking over the coming months and you hear them quite honestly most of the time, actually say we know we can't limit you from moving, right? you can't stay in your house forever.
and then the next step is figuring out how do you address the desire of people to be outside, when the weather is warmer, taking that as an example.
But also still mitigate the risk for people in your province or in the country and it sounds like, for example, with the parks, it will be very much done in concert with provinces.
So if the national park is in Alberta, well it is going to depend how Alberta has re-opened parks there or what the case load is there.
That kind of thing.
The Prime Minister said the details of that were coming.
He said something like in the next week.
a couple of other things jumped out for me and building on what you and catherine were discussing prior to the press conference from the Prime Minister, and that is all of this conversation around the CERB.
So that is the $2, 000 people can access for four months, up to four months, if they've lost their job or have to stay home and can't work, for whatever reason due to COVID-19. There is a big sort of political discussion happening right now about what happens after the four months is up. Do you find a way to transition away from the CERB, make it look something like maybe more like e. I. where it depends on how much you're working instead of it all being taken away if you earn $1 more than $1, 000 a month? and there seemed to be maybe -- I read it as more willingness from the Prime Minister.
He said that is an eventuality.
Something has to happen after.
But he reiterated the idea that nothing is going to change right now and he still views the need for that kind of aid as acute.
There are other questions, and you referenced this with catherine, too, about the level of fraud or fraud occurring and he was pretty direct today saying that that's not going to happen.
Finally direct, I should say.
Because he wasn't in the past few days.
That is not going happen until after.
The issue at hand is whether or not there was a quote-unquote memo written to bureaucrats who are in charge of these applications, saying even if you think it's fraudulent, keep going, still pay.
The Minister of employment karla qualtrough said it was written guidance in the case of the CERB.
That guidance doesn't yet, for example, exist when it comes to the student benefit, which students can apply for tomorrow.
They'll have to assess how many people apply for that before they decide how they proceed.
But it is likely going to be something similar, because of the way you access that money through the C.R.A. With a simple attestation is pretty similar as well.
I think this stuff is, I think, very interesting but also just lends itself to that broader discussion about what -- when we're thinking about what things look like over the coming months, over apparently the coming years, what is the government's role, what kind of financial aid is best -- the most supportive of people who want to stay safe, but also want to go back to work or participate in the re-opening of economies.
and I really -- I mean, we're not at the point right now where we have any concrete answers about what that assistance or that aid looks like two months down the road.



**Marcy**:

I will say that he did say that the wage subsidy details will come out tomorrow.
We'll look forward to that.



**Rosemary**:

I would like the think the Prime Minister was more frank in his response because of your reporting.
Who knows? [laughter]



**Vassy**:

I like that idea, too.



**Rosemary**:

Let's go with it. It was interesting to see how fired up he was getting in defense of the way they roll out this program.
There were a couple of things that I wanted to drill down on. Notably the percentages.
He said we're not going to punish 99% of people if 1% of people seek to commit fraud.
and I want to talk about that a little bit.
Because what we heard from government officials that, overall, the rate of fraud with government programs is below 1%. but there have been an acknowledgment and good few more details from the C.R.A. Officials I spoke to yesterday.
There's an analysis that this is a program that's easy to fraud.
You just have to sign an attestation and say, yes, this applis to me, I want to receive the money.
The official I spoke with yesterday said a more risky program, you might be seeing fraud in the levels of perhaps 2% or 3%. consider this is a $35 billion program and that's the price tag they put on it so far and we're asking questions about the various extension of these programs.
It could be a significant amount of money.
But the Prime Minister making the point, listen, there a lot of people in need.
We put that first and he is happy to stand by that decision.
I would note some of the things that we have been talking about in terms of people who may be accessing this program and aren't eligible, one of concerns that has been raised time and time again is really the prospect of unforeseen consequences here.
Perhaps some of the people who are asking this -- accessing this money do feel a bit financially desperate in this uncertain time, even if they haven't -- they don't meet the criteria specifically.
They really do feel they are in need of this money.
What they may not realize is that the money is taxable and also if you are a particularly low-income Canadian and you're receiving some other sort of government support to help you out, be it subsidized housing and the g. S.t. Credit, that if you are taking in this extra income, that is going show up in your tax at tend of the years and you could lose access to benefits.
Certainly some of the people that I spoke to who deal with low-income Canadians are very concerned about what this might mean for them.
So I think we can all take the Prime Minister's point that there are a lot of Canadians in need.
That is where their focus is. But we also need to ask questions about what is going to happen to people who may have accessed this money.
I would say as well, C.R.A. Officials telling us yesterday that the point is not going to be to penalize people who have been willfully dishonest, but rather to get the money back.
Again, clawbacks from low-income Canadians, what would that look like, who specifically would they go after.
There are more questions to be answered there.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Thank you both very much.
I'm going get some reaction to at least part of the Prime Minister's announcement today and that is in relation to fish harvesters, $470 million for them announced.
Previously announced a large chunk of chains for fish processors but this is the second part of that announcement much needed on the coastal community.
Melanie sonenberg joins me from grand man an island in New Brunswick.
Good to see you.



Good to see you, too.



**Rosemary**:

$470 million and this specific benefit for fish harvesters.
How big of a difference will this make to people?



Well, this a welcomed announcement today.
It's really good news for us. We're pleased to see that the government's made a commitment to the fishing industry.
and the announcement itself acknowledges some of the challenges that the harvesters have had filing into the current program.
All the way around the board, we're really happy about what we've heard today.
Now, of course, we'll need to review the details and see how that unfolds.
Certainly this is welcomed news today.
[please stand by]



In our case, this will be tremendously important to bridging the gap as we go through this pandemic.



**Rosemary**:

I have no problem buying into that idea.
Just give us a sense of what people are dealing with in terms of loss, if you have a sense ofthat.



Well, the fishery is so diverse and it's all relative.
If you're an individual on your boat in the gulf ofst.
Lawrence, the uncertainty about the market has raised the anxiousness of the industry up. That doesn't matter if you're in British Columbia or Newfoundland.
All of the harvesters, across the country, because of all of the unknowns, and it's the same for every sector it's that uncertainty and how to make endsmeet.
Today this announcement starts to address some of that.
There are still things to talk about with the government and that is making sure that our new harvesters that have bought into the fishery, that they'reprotected or people that have made big investments, they'llhave to be recognised here andwe'll have to find a bridge for them in terms of some of the debt load we have.
For everybody, it's the unknown and I don't think we're any different in this sector.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, Melanie.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

I'm rosemarybarton and you're watching our special coverage on CBC newsnetwork" of the prime minister sand the government, federalgovernment's response to thepandemic.
We're standing by at this hour for a briefing from public health officials and cabinet ministers as more details on what the Prime Minister gave us this morning.
There is a virtual covidcommittee hearing of the parliamentarians and there will be a press conference at 1:30eastern from the prime minister of Ontario.
He will set phase one of theprovince's reopening plan andcbc news, though, has learned few of the details because cbc'smike crawley, that's what he does and mike, give us a sense of what to expect from thepremier, then.



**Reporter**:

Thanks for theplug, Rosie.
One thing to clarify, what I saw was a draft of a news release about today's announcement.
So quite possible that things could change and this thing was in such a draft form that it said on it, Ontario will begin stage one of the reopening on, insert date here in thebrackets.
On the retail side, this proposed retail shops that are not located in malls would be allowed to open and they would have to have physical distancing ruling in place, like the number of people per square foot and that kind of thing allowed in as hop at one time.
On the construction side, there's been a certain amount of essential construction allowed to go ahead in Ontario, but nonessential construction would be freed up to go and a number of other things, pet groomers, veterinarians, household cleaning and maintenance and seasonal businesses could getgoing, golf courses, marina andswe're hearing there will be something in the way of scheduled surgeries, which the government had said was going to happen and didn't have details about that.
So still lots to find out from the premier's announcement at1:30. But that's giving you a sense of the scope of what would reopen in this limited phase of reducing the COVID-19restrictions.



**Rosemary**:

It seems to follow the pattern of a lot of otherprovinces, I have to say, in terms of how you do this.
I do know, that the premier has previously talked about the pressure he was under from golfers or golf lobbying groups, if such a thing exist.
So do we feel like that made difference and that is something we will see?



**Reporter**:

At the same time, on the golf course's thing, lots of space to stay away from other golfers if you're out there and you can see how some outdoor type of activities would be allowed to go ahead.
Interesting thing, again, in this draft of the news release, it proposes that individual sport competitions could go ahead and the examples that we renamed were horse racing, track and field and tennis.
I'm a big tennis fan.
So that could be the roger's cu pin Toronto in August, but with no fans in the stands.
So that's another one of the kinds of outdoor-relatedactivities that could resumeunder this plan.



**Rosemary**:

Mike, thank you for bringing us up to date on what to expect in an hour and half time.
Mike is in Toronto there.
Before, as we wait for our press conference at noon and the federal COVID-19 committee at12:15, I want to try to get in our next guest.
Overnight, the federal government announced it'sspending $2.3 million.
The funds will be shared byprovisional, municipalgovernments, as well as first nations and the met is nation andglenn mccallum is the president and we've reached him.
Tell me what we should know about the situation in northern situation in la lash and outside of la lash.



Maybe some background on where we're at right now.



**Rosemary**:

Of course.



We acted quickly in regards to the COVID-19 that came out early in March for us and we setup a task force within our office and it's going really well at our provisional metiscouncil conference call and rolled out our programmes.
The first nations did the same.
I'm very thankful for the federal government responding at that time to deal directly with the met is nation and firstnation's people, to be able to deal with the COVID-19situation.
As you well know, some of theisolated communities in swatchsaskatchewan had a tougher time.
What they've come up with amonitoring points to know who'scoming and going.
As we speak right now there'squite a few communities whohaven't had COVID-19. But for some, there has been and one of the them is the communityof la loche, lice you mentionedand other communities and otherincidents are popping up indifferent communities.
But the reaction that we gaveright away where we set up, themonitoring points slowed downthat process in regards tospreading the virus and so we'reworking with the province now, stepping up to the plate inregards to what is the bestmoving forward plan to be ableto keep our citizens safe.



**Rosemary**:

I know that in laloche, for instance, there's allot of people going door to door to see how people are doing and do tests.
I know they've sent up mobile units in case people have toself-isolate and what will thismoney help you guys do innorthern Saskatchewan? $2.3 million is a lot but theseare remote communities and it'spossible you need a lot there.



Yes, we do need a lot and like you say, you're right in regards to the lack of capacity, the facilities that we have, but the mayor of la louche has been doing a great job in regards to responding to the needs that we need to put in place.
The met is nation has put resources in places, but because la louche and there's a reserve not very far and so they'reworking together and so it compliments the efforts if regards to what we're doing.
We have put some trailers out there for people to use andwe'll continue.
This money that's coming, the$2.3 million that is coming from the federal government really helps to continue supporting communities that don't have the capability or he facilities to be able to isolate certain individuals that have been affected or just isolation, where they could travel from out of the province or differentcommunities.
So it really helps.



**Rosemary**:

How difficult is it right now, because a lot ofsaskatchewan is doing well with cases and the province is slowly reopening and allowing somethings to open up. But meantime, you have a patch of a lot of cases, frankly, this northern Saskatchewan that'stroubling.
Does that mean that people --are you preventing people from coming into the community? is that what people are trying to do in la louche or on the first nation?



Let me say first that theprovince, when this started, reacted in a positive way andthat's why we don't have many cases in central and southernsaskatchewan, but the reaction -- the things that the north did weren't well supported because we wanted to keep the communities safe and the mayor sand the chief put monitoring points in place and we had to work together to be able to come to a point where we can compliment each other.
So as we began to do those monitoring points, it really slowed down.
and there's a lot of isolation.
In central and southernsaskatchewan, people have access to hospitals, but if you gonorth, the communities areisolated, one hundred to200 kilometers apart.
There's one this la louche and island cross and the rest of the time we have to come north.
There's an ND line, northern administrative district andthat's what the problem is using as far as isolation in northernsaskatchewan and that's why the monitoring points are there, but we have to keep supporting with dollars to be able to keep themrunning.
and it's going well.
As a matter of fact, when I get off this interview, I will betalking, the chief and I. Richard Ben and I have been talking to the ministers to how we can put our best footforward, so to speak, in the best interests of our people.
Safety is number one.
So we continue to do that andrecognisedding that the north ISS unique place and isolated, like I said, and don't have the facilities that are needed andthere's more capacity that'sneeded to be able to support the north and that's what'shappening from the met is and first nations and more importantly with the federalgovernment.



**Rosemary**:

I wanted to make sure I got to you because it'san important story.
Thanks for making the time.
I appreciate it.



Thank you for having us.



**Rosemary**:

Our pleasure.



Stay safe.



**Rosemary**:

You, too, sir.
The president of met is nation insaskatchewan.
As we stand by and wait for our briefing from the Minister of indigenous services, we'll talk more about that and I'll bring in the host of "power & politics," Vassy kapelos I thinkthey're entering so I won't dothat.
We'll start with this briefingtoday, but I will remind you that the COVID-19 committee also will get underway and we'llbring you, probably, some of that first round of questions, three, that goes to the Prime Minister from opposition leaders or cabinet ministers.
and this is the Minister of indigenous services, marcmiller, accompanied by the public health officer in indigenous services, as well.
This also hit the neighbouring first nation, the meadowlaketribal council and everything is working together.
Here is the Minister now.
(speaking french).



We are here today with the ministry of fishery and oceans, Minister of the environment and tom Wong, chief medical officer of indigenous service's Canada.
We will speak in the followingorder.
Minister Georgian, ministerwilkinson, Dr. Wong and finallymyself.
Put without further ado, Minister Jordan, please.



Bernadette.



Minister Jordan.
Let's go straight to ministerwilkinson and then we'll go back to Bernadette.
Minister Wilkinson.



Thank you, Marc.
Mellow.



The Prime Minister announced at several national parks, conservation sites on June 1st.
This will align provided with respective provisional health authorities and not apply to all parks and it will be important to check for the status of your local park.
(speaking french).



These openings aim to enable locals to use and to enjoy parks near their homes.
With spring coming, it is important for Canadians to have spaces before they can exercise and discover nature in a manner that respects physical distancing requirements.
We all know how important it to get outside and be in nature.
It is good for our mental and physical health.
This partial reopening will allow visitors to have access totrails, grounds, and green spaces where physical distancing is possible.
The facilities such as washroom sand comfort sayings will be made available to visitors and would emphasize that service swill be very limited to beginwith.
As we move forward, we will hope to expand the range of services.
This is to be done in aprudentmanner.
We must enjoy these places safely and follow the advice and guidance of public health experts and people should check ahead on websites to plan their visit and prepare appropriately and follow us on social media for in-time updates.
Thank you very much.



We'll go back to ministerjordan and see if everything isworking.
Bernadette.



Thank you.
Good afternoon.



Women and many who work in the seafood sector are the drivers of coastal community.
They've been feeding communities for generations and we need for them to do so safely in these challenging times.
The fishing sector faces challenging that are unique and require direct solutions.
That's why today, our government is announcing $469 million in funding to establish the new fish harvester benefit and the first harvesters grant.
This is the single largest investment to the fisheries in nearly 20 years, ensuring thatcanada's hard-working fishharvesters get the support theyneed now and while positioningthe sector for a strongrecovery.
This will provide up to$267 million income support foreligible self-employed fishharvesters and share person'screw who cannot access thecanada wage.
This will go to those whoexperience 25% or more, up to$847 per week for up to 12weeks.
The new fish harvester grant hasdedicated funding for up to$201 million in nonrepayablesupport to licensedself-employed fish harvesterswho cannot access the businessemergency account.
They can use these funds tocover the costs of running theirfishing businesses includingincreases in cost due to thehealth and safety requirements.
Lastly, first harvesters canapply for ei benefits based onearnings from last year andwe'll support you now and intothe future.
We continue to assess andrespond to the COVID-19 and takeadditional actions as needed tosupport Canadians, stabilize theeconomy and mitigate the impactsof this pandemic.
Canadian harvesters areresilient and determined andtoday, I AM urging Canadians toshow support by showing localproducts at your local grocer.
There's never been a better timeto buy a canadian fish andseafood product.
Most who will be heading out forthe spring time tomorrow, theycan continue the work knowingthat the government ofgovernment is here to supportthem every step of the way.
Thank you.
Merci.



Tom, the chief medical officer of indigenous service'scanada.



I want to acknowledge that we are on the traditional territory of the Algonquin people.
As of may 13th, a total of 185cases have been reported among first nations in provinces and this represents less than 0.3%of reported Canadian cases.
Whereas first nations on reserve in Canada constitutes about 1.5%of the Canadian population.
Of the 185 cases, 63% haverecovered.
18 cases and that is 10% require hospitalizations and there have been two deaths on reserve.
The first nations on reserve case fatality rate is currently at 1% and is below the canadianoverall case fatality rate of7%. we are cautiously optimistic that nationally the first nations on reserve curve continues to show signs offlattening.
If there is no future spread ofcovid in first nationscommunities.
This has been accomplished by using public health measures, including lockdown, physicaldistancing, prompt isolation, avoiding crowds, hand and cough hygiene and it has paid off.
Beyond infections in first nations living on reserve, there are many more cases elsewhere incanada involving first nation's, met is and Inuit with COVID-19being reported to the provincesand territories.
Timely, epidemiology datacollected by service's Canada isonly available for first nationsliving on reserve.
We need help from provisionaland territorial healthdepartments and agencies tosupport indigenous peoples to get a comprehensive epidemiologypicture.
It is important to recognise theinherent rights andself-determination of firstnations, innuit and metispeople.
Communities will decide what isbest for them in the uniquecontext of remoteness, access tohealth services, livingconditions and the prevalence ofunderlying medical conditions.
(speaking french).



Communities will decide what system best in the context, the unique context of remoteness, access of health services, living conditions and rev lenseof medical conditions.
However, we must remain extremely vigilant during the gradual reopening of theeconomy.
In order to prevent introduction of this virus to indigenouscommunities.
Merci.and thank you.



Thank you, tom.
As today is indigenous nurse'sday, I would like to by saying thank you, Merci.
, to all first nations and nurses for providing safely healthcare during thecovid-19 pandemic.
As we are learning from past experiences responding to pandemics in Canada and specifically in first nation'sinnuit and met is communities during the h1n1 virus, we needto recognise and understand thatthey have a higher risk of beingdisproportionately affected bycovid-19. The first nations innuit healthbranch provides effective, sustainable and appropriatehealth services that contributeto the reduction of gaps andhealth status between firstnations and innuit and othercanadians and I would like toremind everyone improving thehealth of indigenous people incanada is a sharedresponsibility between federal, provisional, territorial andindigenous partners.
Our goal continues to work withall in partnership to receivethe care they need.
By working together, we'resaving lives.
As of may 13th, Te have seen185 confirmed cases of COVID-19in first nation's communities, 16 cases in Nunavut, northernquebec.
We've also been closely monitorthe case in northwesternsaskatchewan and to supportcommunities in response, we'llbe providing $2.3 million infunding which will go towardsthe northwest pandemic responseplan.
This pandemic plan is acollective effort between firstnation's metis, provisional andfederal partners, and metissaskatchewan have taken responseto the significant outbreak.
The funding will compliment this in support of securitycheck-points and impactedcommunity measures to addressfood security, provision ofhomecare supplies andenhancement of regional capacityincluding youth engagement.
We will continue to work withthe northwest community'scommand centre, including thearea to support their efforts toincreased testing and handsurveillance, strong contacttracing and infection preventingand control measures.
We're focused on the healthresponse that will save livesand I want to reassureindigenous leadership we'recommitted to supportingindigenous communities andactivating their pandemic plansand providing the support incollaboration with provinces andterritories that best respond toeach community's needs inresponse to the COVID-19pandemic.
I would also live to give aquick update.
The Ontario Minister advisesthat risk of flooding has beendowngraded to moderate to lowalong the albany river.
While the downgrade isencouraging, we stand ready forcontingency plans.
The repatriation began yesterdayfor which we have supported airtransportation to the communityto ensure the health and safetyof all members.
We will work in closecoordination in concerns offlooding and evacuation in thearea.
(speaking french).



When it comes to fighting the spread of the virus, urban andon-reserve first nations, innuitand first nation's communitiesare facing unique challenges.
Since the beginning of thepandemic, local organizations, as well as indigenous leadershiphave been working 24/7 toprovide services to indigenouscommunities.
We know that COVID-19 has placedincreased stress on operations.
We will support this through thesupport fund and $15 millionhave been earmarked for originalindigenous organizations, as well as urban organizations.
These to organizations can alsoreceive funds from other federalinitiatives under the economicresponse plan.
and increasedfunding for women's shelter andcentres to help sexual assaultvictims.
Additional funding for foodbanks have also been placed atthe disposal of the indigenousorganizations in order to meeturgent needs.
In addition to federal funding, individuals and organizationscan support these organizationsthrough charitable donations andthis is critical.
However, more support isnecessary and we are workingwith communities to identify thesupport that they need and thesupport that they're asking for.
and we're working closely withgovernment partners to explorefurther possibilities.
To assisturban organizations.
I would like to acknowledgesummer is fast approaching, atime of year that is usuallymarked by sacred ceremonies andevents that are important toindigenous peoples across thecountry.
While banning sundances andother spiritual practises, unfortunately, a spark stain oncanada's history, I want to ensure everyone listening thateven in the face of a historicpandemic, Canada must not andwill not prohibit theseimportant practises.
Any decision to cancel orpostpone these events is at thediscretion of the community.
I would like to reiterate theimportance of the healthmeasures we have been repeating.
Together, we can slow the spreadof COVID-19 by making aconscious effort to keep aphysical distance, avoidingspaces and contact with peopleat higher risk such as elders.
First nation's leadership willultimately decide how to proceedsafely in this context and iwould like to encourage leadersto develop guidelines inalignment with the bestavailable health practise toadapt these ceremonies.
In closing, Tuesday marked 150years since Manitoba joinedconfederation under theleadership of louie rielle andthe metis people.
The metis nation would also formits own distinct culture thatwould further shape Manitoba'sidentity and play a pivotal roleand establishing Manitoba as aconfederation.
This is an opportunity for allcanadians to reflect on the pastand present and to look forwardto the bright future of theprovince.
Part of our present and futureis walking the path ofreconciliation with indigenouspeoples.
We must also acknowledge pastwrongs and chart a new pathforward with respect, cooperation and partnership.
While COVID-19 is impacting thecelebrations that are fittingfor such a significantanniversary, we encouragecanadians from coast to coast tocoast to learn more aboutmanitoba's history and cultureand to participate in the manyvirtual Manitoba 150celebrations and activitiesbeing offered online.
Thank you.



Thank you, Minister and we'llstart on the phone with three questions and turn to the room, with one follow-up.



**Operator**:

If you have anyquestions, press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
(speaking french).



**Operator**:

The first question is Brett forester from the national news.

---

**Question**:

How concerned should we be about a second wave as provinces begin to loosen uprestrictions?



We should be very concerned, Brett.
As we know, until such time as vaccine is found and distributed and administered, the risk of second and third waves is very real and while remoteness has sheltered a number ofcommunities, thanks most importantly to the leadership that medical staff in thecommunity, medical leadership, health officers and political leadership have ensured, we need to remain vigilant.
and the challenge that we all face as a society, as restrictions are lifted, it is very difficult from a political perspective to ask indigenous peoples to do something we would not be prepared to do. We look at the various measures that need to be taken and supporting individual leadership and supporting what is proper to them and they see is important to their communities.
and so with that, is required constant dialogue, constant vigilance and fax with with indigenousservice's canadaepractises are followed in thecommunity.
That will pose with it is an umber of challenges, whether Otis people seeking to come in and out of communities and observing restrictions that aren'tnecessarily observed in urban settings and I think that is something we have started to turn our minds to with food security and all supports the indigenous communities need to weather this global pandemic.



Brett, follow-up?

---

**Question**:

Yes, thank you.
We heard at committee that urban indigenous people often deal with a number of risk factor sand some of them are the same as folks on reserve, such as overcrowding and underlying conditions among others.
and what is your message to first nations to Inuit andmetis people who live in cities and may be feeling ignored or ab it less behind right now?



Well, as we've traced the course of this pandemic, Brett, some things are becoming veryobvious.
One that this pandemic hits the most vulnerable, particularly those in crowding conditions, particularly if older segments of the population.
and we are learning from this.
We know the social determinants of health that have rendered indigenous communities on a less equal footing than nonindigenousand that is restricted to onreserve.
Indeed, in certain urbansettings, there are populations that you can say are even morevulnerable.
We have deployed $15 million tosupport, among other things, 94organizations, the national friendship centre and we'veacknowledged that is notsufficient.
We're working hard to provide additional supports.
There have been other supports, a dedicated number of women'sshelters.
In particular, to support those in need, about $40 million, 10millions of which was dedicated to indigenous shelters onreserve.
There are a number of otherinitiatives.
I'm at a loss to translate it in my mind at this point.
But also the supports for homeless initiatives that have been announced by the Prime Minister, as well as food security initiatives.
All this to say, Brett, that we absolutely acknowledge this is not enough.
There is no way to pin-pointexactly what the outcome of whatthis pandemic will be. We will act proactively tosupport the communities in needand the service providers who doa great job with littleresources to support thosecommunities in need.



Operator, next question, please.



**Operator**:

The next question is from radio-Canada.
Your line is open.

---

**Question**:

Hello, Mr. Miller, My first question is for you.
Last week, you said you were concerned about the possible reopening in Montreal and you were concerned about a second wave and an increase in death.
We recently learned that school swill remain closed untilseptember and childcare service swill be closed until at least the first of June.
No decision has been made so far about the opening of retail inmontreal.
Does this step by the quebecgovernment reassure you at all?



**Answer**:

Thank you.
From the beginning, both or prime Minister and the quebecpremier have based their political decisions on scientific data and sometimes these policy decisions have been very difficult to make inreal-time.
We all recognise what isoccurring in montreal.
Montreal along withthe concerns I expressed withpeople dying in terribleconditions.
That is something that is stilloccurring and we're not out ofthe woods yet.
So I congratulate the legaultgovernment on the decision todefer this reopening.
Of course, we are still closelymonitor the epidemic curve.
Decisions can have an impact inseveral weeks.
This is a virus so the decisionswe make today could haverepercussions that won't show upright away but in a week ormore.
This is not a matter of blamingpeople but realizing we'remaking decisions if real-time.
and if, ultimately, it'snecessary to change decisions, that should be done based onsolid data.
and I would also like to paytribute to our canadian armedforces to help people who are ina very vulnerable setting andthat work will continue untilpeople find themselves in a safeposition once again.
I hope that answers thequestion.
Follow-up question? yes.

**Question**:

Another concern.
You must have heard from another of business people in Montreal, for example, who are saying that the CERB is leading to situation where some businesses are having trouble rehiring.
The wage subsidy may not be as much as they hoped for.
My question, will CERB be over at the four months or are you consider modifying it to encourage people to go back towork? will the CERB just be completely over after the four-month periodor are you thinking of modifyingit?



**Answer**:

In all real-timedecision making, with the typeof economic impacts that youdescribed, it's clear that we need to make sure that we canreadjust and modify ourdecisions when we see that thesituation was with decisions.
I don't think the people withcerb would refuse to work.
People want to work and jobsupport was announced a coupleweeks ago and we need to allowthat to have an impact overtime, trace the economic effectsand ultimately modify ourapproach, if necessary.
Thank you.
The next question, please.



**Operator**:

The next question is from Andrea gunny, from the chronicle herald.

**Question**:

Hi, Minister.
My question is for ministerjordan.
I'm wondering if there needs to be legislation passed for these fisheries and if so, how long they can expect to wait before they can start seeing money for certain things such as the wagebenefit.



Thanks for the question.
There is to legislation that is required for this.
We're working right now around the clock to make sure we can get the benefits out as quickly as possible, because we know how important it to make sure the fisheries has the support that they need and that they've been very much looking for.
So we're working really hard to make sure we get that out as quickly as possible.

---

**Question**:

My second questionis, will it be available for --if somebody doesn't want to go fishing because they're too worried about being in close quarters or they don't have any trusted family members they'refishing with that are certain they don't have COVID-19, will they be eligible for this benefit?



So these benefits arethree-fold.
First of all, to make sure thatpeople who no longer qualify areable to use their income fromlast year in order to continuetheir ei, AI well as making surethat they're able to access thewage subsidy equivalent thatthey do not qualify because ofthe unique nature of theirbusiness.
Of course, having the grant inorder to make sure that they canmeet the needs that they haveimmediately to address theconcerns they have.
It's a $10, 000 grant.
These are all things we'reworking on and making sure theyhave the supports they need, togo fishing, making sure they'reable to collect their ei. It's been something we've her alot about from fisher's for thelast couple of months and that'swhy we're making sure that wehave those supports in place forthem.



Thank you, Minister.
We'll now turn to the room, starting with Mr. Gallagher.

**Question**:

You've commented on the $15 million foroff-reserve innuit first nationsmetis isn't adequate.
But I would like you to commenton the conditional review foraboriginal peoples, saying thefunding is inadequate isdiscriminatory for those people.



Thanks, Kevin.
That's an important question and would like to say I AM no position to dictate to any position to any organization how their legal rights.
We have moved from the beginning to distribute money to service providers on the front line and we haven't funded, per say, any national organizations, as such.
and so, the question in determining the funding was really to get it out to the people that need it the most at that point in time, knowingthere's a $15 million bucket that indigenous service's canadaadministers.
I would say they did receive quarter of a million dollars and my understanding from committeeyesterday, it was their intention to return the funds.
But that said, I don't have any particular comment on the way they exercise their rights and, indeed, it is their right to doso.

**Question**:

Can you give me an understanding of the ventilator capacity of first nation? what is the strategy, if there is an increase in cases and hospitalizations that would require that type of medicalintervention? it's a major concern in big urban centres but I imagine ventilators are hard to come by in isolated first nations.



Thank you for the question.
One of the key thing for us, Otis so important to make sure that we protect the mostvulnerable.
You know, the way to approach the ventilation needs has to Beau well thought out plannedprocess.
For example, it is very unsafe to have ventilators in nursingstations, in remote areas.
Why? because you need specialists.
You need intensive care trained specialists in medicine and innursing.
You need a respiratory therapist and those are all specialist sand they are very hard to comeby, to actually be in a remote and isolated areas, even in. Even in urban areas, there's ashortage.
The way to ensure this is we work with provinces and territories to increase the capacity of existing hospitals so that they have more beds, they have more ICU beds in casethere's a need, you know, to actually use those beds.
Also from a preventionstandpoint, also, the need to try to identify for high-riskindividuals such as ederly, forexample.
Who have a low thresholdwho makybecome sick, it would be at thevery, every early stage to try tosupport them closer to thehospital should they need thattype of terciary care.

---

**Question**:

It sounds to me people on a remote first nation that might need that type of medical intervention, aventilator, they would have to be transported, then, to a majorcentre.
Centre, but a hospital that'sequipped, right?



Right.

---

**Question**:

What is the plan for that? how would that transportationwork?



That's planned for in the problems and healthcare system.



There's a general question think you're asking about the epidemic plan for communities that are difficult to access and there is 96 first nation'scommunities you fly into.
That's a generalized approach and there are some communities where it's advisable to fly out to give birth or transport out of the community when you look at the implementation of pandemic and plans that are attached to it, the communitieshave, depending on the capacity and number of medical personnel in the community.
There's a concerned approach to figure out why it makes more sense so fly someone out.
Tom has explained the the intricacies around that and this is part of a more generalized plan of using hubs and getting people out of those communities and back into regional health centres where we can have the facilities and get back into community in a safe way.
and so I encourage you, concern, to participate.



**Rosemary**:

We'll pull away from this medical briefing.
They were talking primarily about the announcements today, 2.5 million for northernsaskatchewan to deal with an outbreak there and then significant amount of money, 470 million for fish harvesters waiting for additional support.
I will bring in Massey kapelosand Catherine Cullen to help me wrap up where we're at today.
In Montreal, at the top of thehour, we are expecting that the premier will push back opening dates for schools and other things again, realizing thatmontreal continues to be the hot spot in this country for the pandemic and Donald trump, as well, said that a decision on funding from the united states to the W.H.O. Will come soon.
Orsome decision on how the United States will interact with theW.H.O. Moving forward, which, ofcourse, is very important giventhat the United States hassuspended funding and they arethe largest contributor to theW.H.O. I'm not sure where you want togo with any of that, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

I'm fascinated to see what the president may have to say about the W.H.O. Two or three weeks ago, we weresitting here when the presidentannounced it would suspendfunding to the W.H.O. The president himself at the endof January was complimentarytowards china and that posturehas changed.
We'll be watching for thatannouncement and then the onemore close to home that I thinkis relevant to a number ofpeople watching is we've heardfrom people who live inmontreal, which you're right hasbecome, basically, the epicentreof the virus and pandemic inquebec.
They are going to delay, forexample, the reopening ofschools, not just a week, butuntil the fall, specifically inmontreal.
My understanding is, and I couldbe wrong, that I thought premierlegault was touring with themayor throughout much ofmontreal.
We know some of the long-termcare homes in montreal have beenparticularly hard hit, as well.
So not necessarily a hugesurprise that this announcementwould be coming, given two weeksago the premier for sayingschool would reopen.
There was a tonne of surprise, given the caseload, and thecounts were still into the hightriple digit and definitelygoing to watch for that pressconference at 1:00 eastern tosee what the rationale is andwhat some of the furtherimplications are.
I've talked to parents ingatineau who have their kids inschool this week and montrealwill be a different school.



**Rosemary**:

I'll get catherineto talk about that, too.
It is partly the mayor, I think, of Montreal pushing back forcefully against the premier'sidea that things could reopennormally, when we know there's141 or so outbreaks in long-termcare centres and testing isstill nowhere near where itshould be in the province or inthe city, for that matter.



We know the province has set targets for itself that it has, it seems, failed to reach at this point.
There has a scope saying no school until September and no childcare until June 1st and that the decision is yet to be made when it comes how montrealwill deal with businesses.
What I thought was so interesting in that news conference was the response by minister miller who is with the downtown core of Montreal.
It was interesting to see shift between what he was saying over the course of the weekend when he was asked about what was going in Montreal and how he responded from this news fromradio-Canada.
He said I AM concerned peoplewill continue to die inindignitity in great numbers, you know, if we do not addressthis situation and if we are tooquick in opening things back upand deconfinement is the termthat campaigned popularity inmontreal.
Today you heard a fair bit ofpraise and a lot ofunderstanding, I think, too, forthe legault government.
Even if things go wrong, this isto the about blame, but we allneed to work together to makethe best decisions possible.
Mr. Miller saying we're on thesame page wanting to be guidedby science.
It's a fine line officials aretrying to work, expressingconcern but at the same time, not overstepping, overbearingand whatnot.
So certainly a positive reactionfrom Minister miller and we'llall want to hear more about howfranÇois legault explains thisdecision today.



**Rosemary**:

If I'm allowed to plug My own things, we discus sit on My podcast today onpartylines on the way things are so different on the island ofmontreal, as well as how things are looking in the United States.
If you're unfamiliar with thetopic, it's a good place tostart.
I AM embarrassed for plugging that now.
You can watch Vassy on "power & politics" and Katherine cullenon "the national."



> let's turn to albertabecause yesterday they got plans to reopen in much of theprovince, except for Calgary and brooks where the majority ofcovid-19 cases exist.
So restaurants and some other businesses there will remain closed for now.
Asia lapointe owns a restaurant saying she wouldn't open right now even if she could and she joins me right now from Calgary.
So you're restaurant sounds verycool.
I love the name of it.



Thank you.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me why youwouldn't open even if you were allowed to?



I think what happened yesterday is an excellentexample, that things can change on a dime and the potential fora start and stop, particularly in our industry, could becatastrophic, if not fatal for small businesses.
So until things become more, iguess, in stone in terms of timelines and we understand where we're at, since it's such early days, that will be something that we are uncomfortable doing.



**Rosemary**:

So the date now, think, is may 25th.
Do you think that you could reasonably be ready to reopen bythen?



I think if we were to mobilize today, that that is apossibility, but I think the potential for that date to not happen given how quickly things changed yesterday with hours' notice of today's potentialrelaunch, we will definitely refrain from making that move.
We still are quite uncomfortable with the guidelines that we'vebeen offered and don't feel that the health and safety of our team are being considered.
We just need more consideration and more time.



**Rosemary**:

Obviously you have lot of financial pressure onyou, as well.



Yes.



**Rosemary**:

You're deciding the public health aspect is more important for you and tell me about the financial part of it and how you're keeping going.



You know, that is an excellent question.
There has been a lot of federal support initiated which isawesome.
Sorry if you can hear My dogbarks.



**Rosemary**:

That's Ok. [ laughter ]



There's been a lot of support from the federal government but, unfortunately, ten foot henryhas not been the recipient of any of those actions as of yet.
and so we are just standingstrong, hoping that we can make it safe to open and that remains to be seen.
But I do think that thestart-and-stop potential, thatif they push that back again ormobilize, reopen and therebecomes an outbreak, that meansthat we need to stop again, ithunderbay that would be morecatastrophic for us.



**Rosemary**:

You talked about the guidelines, you're not feeling great about them and can you give me a sense of what they are and about how you would be equipped or where you would get the things that you're going to need to protect everybody.



Yeah, that's an excellentquestion.
Now I can't answer all of those questions because while they did work very quickly to try to make restaurant and industry-specificguidelines, they still have openfor a lot of interpretation, inmy opinion, and considering theliability as operators, we justdon't feel they're robust atthis stage enough for us to be able to safely action all ofthem.
There is going to be some leadtime and financial commitmentsto making it all work and wejust need to be certain when we do action that, you know, we canbe confident that the economyand the market is ready to goand the safety of our patrons isfirst is foremost.



**Rosemary**:

I think that is really interesting because know so many people are, like, I'll open but I don't know if anyone will come.
We have seen that, in part, to the United States.
and you are smart to think about the safety part of because it'sa real concern for people.



Absolutely.
The 50% occupancy and two metres between chairs, if there's not people there, we won't be able to survive.
We'll stick it out and hope for the best and work really hard to get safe for everybody.



**Rosemary**:

Ajar lapointe, staysafe.



Take care.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you.
We are standing by, of course, from briefings from provinces across the country, including more details on Ontario'sreopening with the premier at1:30 eastern and details about pushing back some of those reopening dates in Montreal from the Quebec premier and that'shappening at the top of theclock.
The big announcement here from the federal government government today, $470 million for fish harvesters and they have been waiting for that.
