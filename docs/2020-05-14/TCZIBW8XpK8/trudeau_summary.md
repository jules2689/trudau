### Summary:



Over the last two weeks, we've seen our women and men in uniform step up to the plate again and again.
Today, we are launching the chronic pain center of excellence for Canadian veterans at mcmaster yaoufrments -- university.
This center will focus on national research, education and training to provide veterans with the support they deserve.
I know I speak for all Canadians when I say that we are incredibly grateful to the women and men who are keeping us safe right now.
So that leaves you trying to figure out how to either space people out on a fishing boat or cancel your operations.
On top of that, prices and demand have gone down, putting financial pressure on fishers and their families.
Today, I can announce that we're investing almost $470 million to support fish harvesters.
First of all, we are creating the fish harvesters benefit.
We're also introducing additional nonrepayable grants of up to $10, 000 for fish harvesters who own their own business and need support to bridge to better times.
and for workers who are worried about next year, we will change employment insurance rules so that fish harvesters can apply for e.
This all builds on the investments we've made for fish and seafood processors.
and for farmers and aquaculture fisheries, we're also launching $100 million agriculture and food business solutions fund to farm credit Canada.
and to everyone who wants to show their support, buy Canadian, pick up some Canadian cheese to help out a local dairy farmer, have a fish fry or buy Canadian lobster.
Not only will it taste great, but it will help the people who keep putting food on our plates.
That's why yesterday we announced support for the meadow lake tribal council and m√âtis nation Saskatchewan for their pandemic response plan.
Canadians have been doing the right thing these past many weeks and that is why we can announce today some good news for the weeks ahead.
As of the beginning of June, some national parks will be partially re-opening so that people in the area can use trails and green spaces where physical distancing is possible.
That's why, with the weather getting better, we're bringing in new regulations on boating as of June 1 to protect vulnerable communities in the north.
No pleasure craft will be permitted to operate in Canada's arctic coastal waters or in the coastal areas of northern Quebec and labrador.
Of course, this ban does not include boats used for essential fishing and hunting or for local community use.
