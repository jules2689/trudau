Forefront-line workers andthat's an issue that's becomefurther complicated by whatseems to be a new dispute withthe United States.
President donald trump hasordered american-based 3m tostop sending much neededprotective masks north of theborder and even out of the United states.
The Prime Minister says he hopesto speak to donald trump aboutthat decision in the comingdays, but there's no doubt it ismaking an already challengingtask even more difficultycertainly.
We know that tomorrow is thefirst day for Canadians to beginregistering online for theemergency benefits.
That starts tomorrow and manypeople anxiously awaiting that.
The government confirmedyesterday that a millionemployment insurance claims havebeen filed and now processed.
So, that has been done at an exat anextraordinary speed.
David Cochrane joins us fromottawa.
Let's start with the mask issue.
It took up a lot of spaceyesterday and it continues, obviously, to be an issue thatis being worked on behind thescenes.
For people that haven't followedthe inns and outs of that, justbring them up to speed on whatthe president is saying and whyhe is trying to limit thesemasks?



We've always known thatdonald trump is a president an dis protectionist with trade.
He talks about free trade bu tits on his terms.
Now he has restrictions on medically essential equipment using the defense procurement act in the United States.
To more or less order 3m one of the big manufacturing of thisequipment, not to send anything it makes abroad.
The issue with that is 3m has pointed out.
Their supply chains are integrated and they have subsidiaries around the world and rely on raw materials fro mother countries and America also gets medical supply's from othercountries.
Starting a war on this front ends up hurting absolutelyeverybody.
We know that the canadiangovernment has been working furiously behind the scenes to troy to convince the United States administration to change its mind on this to ensure thatcanada and the united states continue to have as much n95sand other medical equipment asit can get.
I hesitate as much as it needsbecause the need is so dire andgreat right now.
What we know is the Prime Minister is going to be askedabout this today, obviously.
I'm told though that there is nobig news to break on this yet.
They've kind of adopted anapproach with a similar to whatthey did during the naftanegotiations where every singlecabin Minister reaches out totheir counterparts, premiers arereaching out to governors andsenior administration officialsand strayed officials, doug fordreaching out to robertlighthizer for for example, trying to convince them of thefolly of this particular --humanitarian level and also in aself-interest level which may bethe more compelling argument forthis administration.
There is yet, as of yet, noscheduled conversation betweenthe Prime Minister and thepresident.
One thing I'm aware of is thatthe canadian government istrying very hard to avoidgetting into a bargainingsituation directly with trumpand they don't get drawn into acovid-19 pro quo as he seekssomething from them in returnfor him moving on his position.
They're trying to appeal to thereason of the, s. Administrationthat what they're doing isunreasonable and it will hurtboth country from medicalsupplies and personnel areflowing across the border atsuch a significant rate if atime of great crisis.



**Rosemary**:

We know Canada will receive millions of masks but these are surgical masks not the masks you are talking about.
They're still needed but not thesame.
Canada also now says that it has secured a warehouse in china Southey can put stuff there and store stuff there because we'veheard about these on going bidding wars.
You mentioned a little bit the back and fourth here that couldhappen.
The Prime Minister has not -- idon't think he has thrown down the hammer in terms ofretaliation, but it's fair to say, David, that the government knows what kinds of things coulepulled if they had to go down that road.



**Reporter**:

There's two thingsthere, one, I don't thinkcanada, given the way the government has approached this and just the way this countryfunctions, as a free trade, globalist sort of country who believes in helping othercountries, wants to do anything to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis that any country is going through by engaging in a trade war that would cut off criticalsupplies.
We have a pulp mill in britishcolumbia that feeds about 90% of the necessary raw materials for another company that makesbadly-needed masks.
You want to retaliate, cut offthe supply of raw materials sothe United States can't make the masks itneeds and it's a raise to thebottom.
They're eager to avoid that.
We may have things we can do to the americans but no one in theworld is bigger and morepowerful than the united stateswhen it comes to economic powerand retaliation.
This president in an electioncycle with lives on the line you don't know where it will go. Canada is trying to work behindthe scenes to find aco-operative andmutually-beneficial resolutionto all of this because theglobal supply chains are fierceand the competition is insaneright now with people offeringcarbon the tarmacs to divertgoods from one count introduce oanother.
The top financial officials ofthe state of illinois races upthe highway with a three and ahalf million dollar check tocheques fora middle man from ch. It's that kind of situation onthe markets right now, asimplified negotiated commonsupply chain is in the bestinterest of everybody if you canget to that point.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, David.
We'll be back with you from the prime Minister.
That's the shot of the Prime Minister's front door and he will speak in about 10 minutes or so. Let me go to our colleague, paulhunter, he is in Washington.
Just to get the flip side of this story.
I don't think the president is expected to speak today, Paul, but yesterday was asked about this issue of trying to secure equipment for the united state sand the United States only.
and doesn't seem to be too open to conversations, even though we know they're happening behind the scenes.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, I mean --it's a tough time to read donaldtrump.
I mean, it has always been thus.
But now particularly so. I mean, it wasn't so long ago they were talking about soldier sup near the Canadian border fromhere.
That didn't really play out thatway.
There seems to be some sense yesterday when trump was pressed on this that maybe there was some wiggle room or hedging but it's just hard to say, you know.
In deed all the talks going on behind closed doors on the telephone and no one knows what he is thinking on this.
It's as if the messaging can change from day-to-day broadly.
He was under incredible pressureto implement the defenseproduction act, which is whatthis is all about.
It's in loin with his broadthinking of put america first, make sure this country is sortedfirst and foremost.
At the same time, he continuesto downplay aspects of theseverity of this broadly.
Bottom line it's hard to read.



**Rosemary**:

There's been talk about potentially, you know, obvious low the president said a week ago that people could think sanctions or restrictions would be lifted by Easter, that hasn'tbeen the case.
I now see more conversations where the president suggests people might be able to go to church for Easter.
Again, really complicated and contradictory messaging coming from him and others on facemasks, on what you can do. What is the latest in terms of what the president is saying an dhow people should be acting?



**Reporter**:

Well, let's look at the United States broadly.
Here in d. C. it's a ghost towntoday.
I passed probably half a dozen people on the way to work, while was wearing a mask as we are instructed to do when we stepoutside.
Keeping My physical distance, 100%. word in this country right now is to get set for a horrifically sat and awful week.
Yesterday trump said it would Bethe toughest week yet for the United States many of those who got sick couple of weeks ago are nowdying.
Meanwhile, most but not all United States states have stay-at-home ordersand those who haven't are beingtold but it's almost as ifthey're being begged to telltheir residents to stay home, ifnot for a month, at least for a week in d. C., we're told thenext two weeks to not even gointo grocery stores orpharmacies.
The next seven to 10 days hereare not only going to see thedeath toll mount and mount butthey're critical to continue toslow the spread.
Stay away from other people iskey, as we've been toldthroughout.
All of that said, and eventhough trump was more somberthan ever about it yesterday, mixed messages from him thisweekend from the notion he won'twear a mask.
Idea that he would like to seethe nfl season begin on time.
Again, it's complicated tryingto square what health officialsare saying with what thepresident is saying.
Meanwhile, 300, 000 people nowinfected.
More than 8, 000 dead.
Hotspots in new york, detroit, louisiana, we're told d. C. andpennsylvania and connecticut arein danger of ramping up. You know, we heard a day afterday, as well, in new york as itapproached its apex they'rerunning out of equipment andmedical gear and there's notenough, trump talks about theneed, being exaggerated bystates and cities.
Louisiana says it will run outof ventilators next week and newyork is getting ventilators fromchina.
Meanwhile, the country waits.
Physical distancing ishappening.
It's having an effect but thenumbers are going to get worsebefore they get better.



**Rosemary**:

Ok. Cbc's Paul hunter in Washington.
Thank you, Paul, appreciate it. As Paul gave you the updated numbers in the United States, let me bring them to you for this country.
We're at 14, 000 cases, more than274 deaths.
Important though also to remind you that there are 2800 cases that are now resolved.
So, just gives you an overview.
Of course those numbers are ever changing and don't paint an accurate picture of what is happening right now because not everyone is being tested.
Before we get to the Prime Minister, I want to go to community that's been deeply affected over the past number ofdays.
More people at the six nations of grand river have tested positive for COVID-19. The total is in that community is now up eight.
Joining me to talk about that is chief market and we've reached him in six nations territory near brantford, Ontario.
Good to see you, chief.



Good morning.
Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

So eight people in the community now infected.
What are you doing to protect them and everybody else?



The most recent of what we'vedone and I know we've declare dour community emergency on Marc.
We're at the most extreme measure we've taken which we'venow restricted access to ourterritory.
We have an emergency response working diligently around theclock.
This is just one, again, the importance of protecting all of our people.



**Rosemary**:

I know the government said aside about$305 million for indigenous communities to make sure you have all the equipment you need.
So what is this state of things in your community? do you have the personal protective equipment? are there places people can go to self-isolate if they need to?



We actually, again, that's an issue since the beginning.
I know it's for around the country and the globe.
Personal protection equipment along with the swabs andtesting.
We have our own assessment centre set up in conjunction with our health service and ourpublic-health officials.
Again, we've done this in alsolooking further to analternative care site to helpwith the local hospital, thesurgery ans that we've beencoming.
We received $2.2 million inemergency funding from thefederal government but you know, from a population of 27, 000members in roughly about 14, 000on reserve, that 2.2 only goesso far and so you know, that'sbeen some of our challenges andthe shortage of equipment andsupplies but also even inregards to the emergencyfunding.



**Rosemary**:

Sure.
I only have about two minutes because the Prime Minister is coming out of his house and talk to us, chief, but I know there are some communities that have contemplated bringing the military in or reservists in if they need that.
The military is happy to dothat.
is that something you need at this stage or what would be sort of the trigger point for further support for you?



I mean, I think at thispoint, our community, the way that our community has come together during this crisis is exactly what we need right now.
For each other to continue to protect each other.
One of the -- you know, also areas that wove talked about and as our council, we have multiplebusinesses, one in particular enterprise that pays the federal government a number, hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes so we have literal low liymillions of dollars to pay the federal government and yet it'sa huge discrepancy when yet we receive such little funding for emergency services when we could be having this funding.



**Rosemary**:

How are people doing with the physicaldistancing? I don't know how big the territory is. I imagine it's pretty big bu tare people following thepublic-health directions?



So, it was difficult in the beginning just like any where else but now with the seriousness and when you have confirmed cases here it really hits home.
I think that's now where our community is at. It's taking the seriousness of this and following the strictprotocols.



**Rosemary**:

Chief mark hill of six nations of the grand river.
Thank you for checking in with us and we'll of course keep us posted on what is happening in the community.



Thank you for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, stayhealthy.



> as we stand by and wait for the Prime Minister of Canada to emerge from his home there to gives his daily update oncovid-19, we are expecting him to talk a little bit more about the emergency relief benefit, which will be available startingtomorrow.
Remember, that gives you access if you lost your job for anyreason, do you to the pandemic, you can tap into $2, 000 a month.
I'll go back to David cochraneas we wait for the Prime Minister but we may have to cut you off if that happens.
Because of the massive increase in the wage subsidy, which went from 10% to 75%, and really covers any business now, theydon't, I think, expect as many people to apply for this emergency benefit as they had before because they're hoping the wage subsidy will do what the benefit is going to do.



The difference is the cerbcan put money in your pocket within a week if you registertomorrow.
So depending on how desperate people are, they may apply for one before moving to the other.
There may be a bridging periodrequired.
Rosie, very importantly, we'llfind out this week, and I'll get this in quickly because I see him coming out, what thecountry's I. T. systems are made of and can they handle the flood of applications.



**Rosemary**:

Good point.
Here is the Prime Minister ofcanada.
