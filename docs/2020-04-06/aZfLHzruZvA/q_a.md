Thank you.
The first question is from davidfrom Reuters, your line is open, please, go ahead.



Yes, thank you, Prime Minister.
If I can talk about the temporary foreign workers who will work on Canada's farms, what are the plans to get the60, 000 people to Canada?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We understand that our agricultural producers and farmers right across the country rely very much as well as fishprocessers and the fisheries industry rely on temporary foreign workers to make sure that we can feed our country.
That has been the way for many, many years and we're, of course, looking to ensure that we'reable to receive temporary foreign workers that they will be properly quarantined for two weeks before they start doing the work that is so necessary for us all.
At the same time, we see many, many Canadians out of work who are wanting to help out.
Students who are looking at opportunities for summer jobs that they might not otherwisehave.
and we know there are many people interested in helping out in terms of feeding thiscountry.
We're going to be having more to say in the coming days and weeks about how we're going to pull together and make sure that our agricultural producers, ourfisheries, our agricultural transformers are going to get the support that they need.



We recognize that it'sextremely important for our farmers who are working so hard as well as the fishing industry to have temporary foreign workers to help out during theseasons.
We do have to bring in foreign workers in order to do thatwork.
We have to ensure those people are isolated before they beg into work on farms across thecountry.
At the same time, I want to say that there are a lot of people, including a lot of young people, who don't know what kind of jobs they will have this summer and they may be interested in helping out on a farm or helping out to feed Canadians through this important work.
I do hope that we will be able to find ways together to help our farmers to continue to feedcanada.



Secondly, you are speaking to us everyday and the deputy Prime Minister is either having meetings or speaking to us, Dr. Tam is speaking to useveryday, what are you doing to prevent burnout? there's no way you can continue at this pace? are you drawing up some sort ofplan?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We're looking at howwe're all going to work through this issue.
It takes an adjustment for all of us. I have very much enjoyed my opportunity to speak directly with Canadians everyday and will be continuing trying to do it to almost everyday at least for the foreseeable future.
It's important for people who are doing important jobs to take time to make sure that they'regetting the support they need and I've spoken with our ministers many times about needing to make sure we'repacing ourselves because we do know this situation is going to last a number of weeks, a number of months, and therefore, we have to make sure that we're all supporting essential workers, particularly our healthcareworkers, our truck drivers, our food delivery people, but it counts for government officials as well.



Thank you, next question.



The next question is from rose smith from the "torontostar." your line is open.
Please, go ahead.



Prime Minister, good morning.
I just wonder if there are updates on the n95 masks and how critical was the 3m productioncanada supply and you haven'tspoken to president trump yet? just wondering if that's on the radar and why there's been Adela in that conversation?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We continue to know that we have to get the necessary equipment and P.P.E. To our front-line healthworkers.
There's a global shortage right now where people are trying to get as much as they can and we are continuing to work with all our traditional suppliers and new suppliers to make sure thatwe're providing the equipment needed for Canadians.
It's why we've ramp ed up domestic introduction as Welland fill our needs within the coming weeks.
At the same time, the conversations continue with theamerican administration in terms of solving this issue.
As I've said, both sides of the border benefit tremendously from the flow back and fourth of essential supplies and of medical goods and services and that is the point that we'remaking to the administration.
I am confident that wore going to be able to solve this and look forwards to speaking with the president in the comingdays.



We know how important it is to provide essential equipment to our front-line workers andhealing care workers.
and that's why we are workingwith suppliers across the worldto secure that equipment.
We're confident we will receivethat critical equipment fromvarious places in the world butwe're also working specificallywith the United States to tryand resolve this issue.
We know that it's in theinterest of both of ourcountries to continue to ensurethat essential goods andservices can continue to flowacross the border in bothdirections.
I think it would be a shame forboth of our countries if thatwere to be interrupted.
We're working in a veryconstructive manner with theUnited States administration this timeand I'm looking forward tospeaking to president trump atthe appropriate time in thecoming days.



As a follow-up to the Prime Minister, you referenced ityourself that thousands ofuniversity and college studentsare coming out of school with noimmediate prospect of findingsummer jobs and they're worriedabout tuition and expenses whenthey return to school in thefall.
The agriculture may work forsome but obviously not for thosein then city.
I just wonder if that's on thegovernment's radar screen.
I understand they won't qualifyfor the emergency benefit, whatother help might be fourthcoming.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

This is an issue we'revery aware of from modifications to the Canada summer jobprogramme to looking at direct support for students.
We know that we need to do moremor young people, as they come out of university and look for projects and ways of securing income this summer many of it'ssomething we're closely engage on and should have more to say in the coming days.



We know that for young people who are finishing university andwe're relying on a job thissummer, perhaps in the tourism industry or elsewhere, in order to be able to pay for their studies in the fall, thatthey're very concerned about howthey're going to be able to come through that period.
We are looking very closely at ways that we can help them.
We know that this is a real need within our society and we will be there to support our youngpeople.



Thank you.



Good morning, Prime Minister.
More than two days ago, Mr. Trump made his comments about the infamous masks.
Since this is an urgent issue, how is it that you haven't yet been able to speak to presidenttrump? is he the one refusing to take your call?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We are working at all levels of the United States administration.
For a number of years now, we have been engaging with the administration on various issue sand we have developed an ability to resolve issues such as this.
We are doing everything we canto resolve this properly because we know that it is absolutely essential to have the right equipment for our front-lineworkers.
It's been many years that we'vebeen working now with thisparticular americanadministration and we'vedeveloped certain abilities towork with them in the right way.
We're continuing to engageconstructively with the entireamerican administration tohighlight how important it isthat goods flow both ways andcontinue to flow both waysacross our border.
We will continue to do the rightthings to ensure that our frontline workers and our healthprofessionals get the equipmentthat they so need.



Now in the midst of a crisis, how would you describe hisbehaviour? the behaviour of United States presidenttrump?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Well, My job is to work with Americans, to work with our allies and partners around the world to servecanadians and to ensure thatcanadians have everything that they and we need.
That's ex low what I will alwaysdo.



Last question.



Thank you.
The next question is from markbonocosti, sun media, please goahead.



Good morning, Prime Minister.
Today is the 484th day thatmichael kovrig and michaelspavor have been in chinesejails.
We heard the Chinese embassy in march saying that Mr. Kovrig ormr.
Savor was allowed to call his ill father by telephone and they have been given better food to buildup their immunity to fight off COVID-19. Has anyone been able to VI's the them and give us an update on their condition and well-being?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Thank you for yourquestion.
I can assure you that not just our ambassador and embassy inbeijing, but the government ofcanada continues to be focused and engage on bringing these twocanadians home.
We recognize the difficulties that mike at savor michaelkovrig are facing and have faced for a long time.
It's an issue we bring up continually with the chinesegovernment and we continue to impresses upon them that it is important that they be treated better and in deed that they be released to come home to Canada.
We will continue that work.



Do you have an updated report from our own people on the ground there?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We continue to engage with them for counselor support and I will ensure an update in the coming days.



Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
Now, the Canadian emergency benefits starts tomorrow but some people are wondering whether there's any point in working part-time to make $1500a month or should I not stay athome and get My $2, 000 a month? what do you say to those workerswho are facing that dilemma? will you change the system?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Well, we have taken unprecedented action to help thousands of Canadians who now suddenly find themselves as no fault of their own, without anincome.
We want people right across the country to stay at home.
and not to work unless it'sabsolutely essential.
For that reason, we had to develop programmes quickly to help as many Canadians aspossible.
We also recognize that in someindustries, some workers may be asking themselves that question and that's why we are working now to develop other ways to encourage people, who are providing essential work, to be able to continue that important work at this time.
and we know that this is situation where there isn't single measure that will work for everyone.
As we move forward, we hear these concerns and we're seeking solutions and we will continue to work on them.
We recognize that in moving forward with unprecedented measures to help as manycanadians as possible, we had to move quickly.
We recognize that millions ofcanadians are suddenly out of work and needed support so that they could stay home, so that they could take care of their families and followpublic-health directives duringthis time.
That was the priority and thatis why we move very quickly to get help out to Canadians.
We recognize that any time we'redoing big measures like this, there will be gaps, there willbe challenges andimplementations and unforeseenconsequences that's why we'reworking carefully to ensure thatpeople who are working inessential industries, people whoperhaps are facing choices aboutwhether they continue to work orwhether they receive the cerbare able to make the rightdecision, not just for them butfor our community and ourcountry.
These are things we're going tocontinue to work on and we'llhave more to say in the comingdays.



What do you understand about the dilemma of certain industries who are having trouble finding people to comein?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

Well, at this point, we're talking about the kinds of changes we could bring into encourage people to stay at work when that is essential work thatdoesn't reflect the amount of the CERB.
We know that this is a very difficult situation and we'regoing to have to work on it and at this time, we are doing that work to try and resolve thatissue.



Prime Minister Janet silver global news.
Yesterday, you said millions of masks were en route from china.
I'm looking for a clarification.
With knows n95 masks.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

There was a blend of surgical masks and n95 masks.
I'm not sure which particularpreportion was in that shipment but we can get answers to yousoon.



**Caller**:

Adrian dicks onfriday called on the federal government to be more aggressive with enforcement and screening at the border.
I'm just wondering what steps are being taken on that front?



First of all, we recognize that the vast majority ofcanadians who were stuck overseas have returned to canadaand therefore those flights are being reduced as there are an umber more to come in. We recognize that there will be fewer and fewer travelers arriving in Canada in the coming days and weeks.
As we continue to move forward, it's going to be extremely important that we continue making sure that everyoneisolates, understands they need to be under quarantine for two weeks when they enter Canada in order to not be spreadingcovid-19.



Ashley Burke, CBC news, Donald trump said he is starting to move millions of doses of drugs used for auto immune diseases no an emergency stockpile to make it available to United States coronavirus patients.
What happens to people in canadawho are cut off from vital drugs they need for other diseases? do you plan to speak to trump about this?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We know that it is absolutely essential that people continue to get the essential medications that they need.
Whether it's related tocoronavirus or not.
That is why we're working with the Canadian drug industry, we have a significant pharmaceutical industry incanada to source the things we need and we're continuing to work with suppliers and partners around the world on the delivery of life-saving drugs that arenecessary beyond COVID-19treatments.
We're going to continue to ensure that every step of theway Canadians get the supportand the medications that theyneed.



We recognize that even in the midst of this crisis, withcoronavirus, there are people who need essential medications to continue to live and have the proper quality of life.
We are working with the pharmaceutical industry here incanada and around the globe to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to the medications they need.



**Caller**:

What about this situation in particular as wellwhat's being done behind the scenes to make sure the C.R.A. Website doesn't crash tomorrowwhen it processes these cerbapplications, can the systemhandle it?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We're working very hard to ensure that our systems are robust enough to handle the unprecedented demand.
There have been discussions around different ways of ensuring that the system is not overloaded and we will continue to keep Canadians apprised ofthat.
At the same time, yes, I will continue and we will continue to work with the americanadministration on all issues that matter to Canadians.
We recognize that there is an unprecedented demand on government systems at this time.
That's why we've taken steps to try and counter any possible overloading of the system but we will monitor things at every step so Canadians receive what they need as soon as possible.



Yesterday president trump gave remarks on 3m. He said at one point, we need the masks, we don't want other people to have them.
He went on to say that 3m to sell masks to other countries.
Can you give us a clear understanding of what the United States has told Canada is their policy on the 3m and n95 masks.



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

We continue to work closely with the americanadministration on solving thissituation.
We understand how important Otis for goods to continue to flow in both directions over ourborder.
There are essential medical services and supplies thatcanadian companies deliver toamericans and there are essential medical supplies delivered by American companies to Canada.
We will continue to work together to ensure that those flows are non interrupted because it would be harmful to both of our economies and both of our citizens.
That is why we continue to work with the Americans on thisissue.



When we asked you about this3m situation previously, youreferenced the fact there aremany canadian nurse and doctorswho live in Canada but work inthe unite States yesterday, you said thatretaliatory threats orretaliation on this is nonproductive but I want to be veryclear, will you at any point bannurses and doctors who live incanada to go work in the United States oris this just a reminder topresident trump?



**Prime Minister JustinTrudeau**:

I'm not going to engage in hypothetical, we will keep Canadians safe in as constructive way as possible.
It's always been our approach with the Americans and it's been effective until now.
We'll continue to be.



We node to ensure the protection of all Canadians and have the necessary equipment for all Canadians and by working constructively with theamericans, we believe we have Good chance of being able to resolve this issue.
I don't think it would be a good thing to harm our neighbours in order to do what we want to do. I think we have to resolve thattogether.
Thank you, very much and have great Sunday.
