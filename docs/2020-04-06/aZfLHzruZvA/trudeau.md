Keep your spirits up these days but one thing that should give us all hope is the waywe've come together as acountry.
Crisis such as this one test the limits of our solidarity and in these difficult times, we'veseen businesses step up to help protect our healthcare workers.
We've seen doctors and nurses come out of retirement.
We've seen people raise money for local food banks, check on their friends, and help our mostvulnerable.
Many of you may be wondering how you can help.
I want to remind you the very best thing you can do to fight this pandemic is to followpublic-health recommendations.
Wash your hands and stay at homeexcept for critical things likegetting groceries or medicationsand try to make that trip onlyonce a week.
If you do have to go out, keep asafe distance of at least twometres with others.
That is how you can can keepdoing your part.

Bolstering the military's rankswill help offset some of theeconomic consequences ofcovid-19 and ensure that ourcommunities are well supported.
In this crisis, every actionmatters.
If you refuse to follow expertsadvice, you are putting your ownlife at risk and endangering thelives of loved ones andjeopardizing the health of allmembers of our society.
