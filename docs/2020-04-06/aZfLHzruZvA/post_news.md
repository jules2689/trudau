**Rosemary**:

That is the Prime Minister of Canada confirming for all of us, it's Sunday, because who knows at this point.
It is. a couple of bits of news therefrom the Prime Minister.
Primarily out today to remindcanadians that that relief fund, that relief benefit is available starting tomorrow.
You says that if you sign up to receive it, it's three to five days fur getting direct payment and by mail it's 10 days.
Lots of questions about whether the system, the Canadian revenueagency, will be able to handle what is expected to be a large demand for the benefit.
The Prime Minister says thatthey're prepared and they'vebeen preparing.
Let's bring in the davidcochrane.
He is in Ottawa with me. Let's start with that.
The emergency benefit, David, because there are so many people keen to get it. We know that more than 2 million people have a employed for employment insurance.
The last time we got an updatednumber.
a lot of people want that to happen and it will happen and they can start doing thattomorrow.



**Reporter**:

They're asking people to stagger how they apply to this.
There's a tweet from the Prime Minister saying it opens up tomorrow but they want people, if you are born in January, February and March to apply tomorrow and if it's April, may, June, Tuesday and Ok. novemberand Thursday Thursday and fridayand Saturday and Sunday anybody can apply.
They want to do that stagger the system so it doesn't getoverwhelmed.
Our colleague is running a lot of this behind the scenes andcanada revenue agency she tellsus, has been doing troubleshooting to make sure the systems around overloaded and they expect that process will run smoothly.
It's a hope.
They expect it and they've done what they can but who knows ho wit will get flooded tomorrow.
The other interesting questions are the unintended consequences of the way the Canada emergency response benefit has rolled out and the way it was designed.
I mean, you are essentially creating a large widescaleuniversal basic income on the fly from scratch.
There are cracks.
People whose income hasn't flat lined may not qualify.
People in certain groups may notqualify.
The questions we heard fromradio-Canada about people whowork say in a grocery store, vital at this point in time butthey have to go to work andthey're at some personal riskand their salary is lower thanwhat they might make through thecerb.
What is the unintendedconsequence for people who willgo on that $2, 000 a monthincome? these are the challenges withrolling it out.
They have just been rushing outlarge-scale, multi-billiondollar programmes at a clip ofone a week because that is whatthe situation has demanded.
So we'll get that first cleartest tomorrow as people wake up, log on, and try to apply and getthe money that the need to makeends meet and we'll find outpretty quickly if the system isable to hold.



**Rosemary**:

They were able to process a million employment insurance applications over fairly quick period of time compared to what they usuallydo.
The C.R.A. Would normally bedoing taxes.
They're not doing that.
There's a little capacity there.
Just on the things you talksabout, the notion that anessential worker, someone at agrocery store might say, I'mgoing to make more money on thecerb.
I have My producer to check thatbecause it sounded a littlestrange too.
You can just quit your jobbecause you don't want to do itand get the emergency benefit.
You can't do that.
You can't voluntarily quit yourjob and get the relief benefit.
You would then have to go one.
I. I understand that people maythink that's unfair but that'swhat would happen.
The other people that fallthrough the crack and the Prime Minister was asked about thistoo are students.
They are not eligible eventhough we know what job theywould be able to get right now.
It did sound like the governmentis looking at that and is awarethat is a problem as well.



**Reporter**:

That's something the Prime Minister said he will have in the coming days.
I feel like there's only threedays.
Yesterday today and tomorrow in the way the new weeks areevolving.
This is such an issue in Quebec, Rosie, premier legault said they need extra money because yes technically you can't quit but people could find a way if they feel it's to their benefit and want to reduce that risk.
This is a live issue that they need to deal with going on. Students, yes, and to link thattoo, temporary foreign worker sis an issue that the Prime Minister was asked about today and an issue that came up last week when the Prime Minister, think it was Thursday night, spoke with the premiers aboutthis.
The agriculture sector needsthis, the fish processing sector needs this, this is the model, the economic model on which these industries survive in this day and age.
There's a political concern about bringing in buffaloes and plane loads of people from outside the country at a time ofwidescale quarantine and concerns over the spread ofdisease.
Also, at a time of acute unemployment and economic need.
Now, a lot of these temporary foreign workers work at a wage that most Canadians would notwork in. This is why this programmeexists.
If there's push back and difficulty in bringing peoplein, finding a place to house them as they go through the14-weeks and bearing thatexpense you like at supply chaindisruption with food and otherthings like that and the pickingplanting seasons we have to gothrough in the ago agriculturecentre.
It may be something studentswant to do. It's how you with mobilizepeople and people that live in alarge urban centre how easilythey with work in thisagriculture centre.
These are all big questions tosolve.
One of many big questions tosolve that keep landing on thegovernment's plate during all ofthis.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you, David.
I'll be back to you shortly.
I should point out there wasn'ta lot of clarity given on the ongoing dispute, shall I call it, with the United States on the state of masks.
The Prime Minister wants to speak to the president in the coming days and the two governments continue to engageconstructively.
It was a very diplomatic language the Prime Minister used around that but we know conversations are happening behind the scenes to try and prevent the United States administration from shutting down different parts of the supply chain that are required to make these n95masks.
Speaking of masks and thingsneeded for healthcare workers, iwanted to take time to get todirector of geriatric as the theuniversity health network intoronto.
Good to see you, doctor.



Thank you, rosemary.



**Rosemary**:

I saw your tweet.
I don't know, one of the many times I woke up last night when woke up early this morning.
It did warm My heart a littlebit.
I'll show people what youtweeted.
You tweeted, I stopped the ca rand wept last night.
It was after midnight.
I was driving home from another18-hour day at sinai health, thank you for these acts of lovethat are keeping front-linehealth workers going.
It was after midnight so I wasstill awake.
What did that mean to you to seethat?



It was one of those things where for all of us who are at the front lines, for me as ageritrition, where COVID-19 isbroughtal.
Woe worried about each other, our patients and the country.
We haven't seen the worse of ityet.
We know that in two to three weeks our hospitals will befull.
We're going to start seeing reports that you are seeing in new York and hopefully not ital yin Spain.
and so there's a lot of anxiety and amongst us, we're trying to continue our routine care and make sure our regular patients are Ok. We don't want to make mistakes.
We have all of that wearing onus.
So, it means that your usual days are twice as long.
You are doing a lot more work and you are exhausted and you are tired.
Just again, we have five major hospitals with many people like me so coming home at the end of long day, and just seeing an act of love and it's just solovely.



**Rosemary**:

I'm glad that can bring a smile to your face.
You are the director of geriatrics and so many older people in this country are at risk for this.
We see it. These break outs in long-termcare centers.
It's very troubling.
How difficult is it to belooking after some of the mostvulnerable at a time like this, knowing that you might not winall of those battles?



We've already lost a number of battles, every single life we lose is the potential life of an infection you could haveprevented.
The population I most worried about right now, is we know when you -- the average population, the death rate is 1% to 2% soalcanadians in general.
When you start getting into your60s, 70s, 80s the deathrate climbs by three, eight, 15, 24% and for those living innursing homes it's 1/3. So, when that virus rippedthrough that home recently, 60residents, you to the math, 20are now dead.
It's a matter of math.
So, the question is, could wehave done more to prevent thevirus from getting in the home.
Can we protect people in thosesituations for doing that andso, behind the scenes and onlyam I just caring for My regularpatients working with mycolleagues to prepare ourhospital and the sites we have to provide to older people, buton the side, late at night, early in the day, I'm speakingto the ministers, federally, provincially, making sure thatwe do everything we can toprotect those seniors, the over400, 000 living in care homesacross the country.



**Rosemary**:

What about theidea, and I've heard some people talk about, just taking your parents or the older person in your life who might be in one of those centers, out, if you can and if they can.
What do you think of thatnotion?



Yeah, I mean, it was -- is truck a cord, I know, when the globe wrote an article about this and said, Dr. Sin ha what would you do. I said I would if you could.
For families and you know, individuals who chose to live Ina long-term care setting, that'snot a light decision.
It's usually families who havebecome exhausted.
They can't provide anymore care.
There's not enough home careavailable.
The care difficulties are toomuch.
That is why people have madethat difficult choice to bethere and so it wasn't a glibcomment but it's a call toaction to say, you know, whilewe're very much concerned aboutour hospitals and making sure wehave enough beds and all thosethings, are we doing enough andcan we do better to protect the400, 000 people who, if all ofthem get COVID-19, that meansover 100, 000 will die.
So this is the opportunity.
In Ontario, for example, iworked closely with ministerfullerton, the Minister oflong-term care and we changedthe regular laces.
There are families, for example, that the Prime Minister wastalking about, where people areunemployed and they're saying icouldn't work and also care formy mom with dementia but I havefamilies now who are saying, well, I'm out unemployed and youknow what, I could actually carefor mom and I know what herneeds are.
They haven't evolved that much.
If I can take her home.
What we've done in Ontario, forexample, is we said if you can, and you are prepared for and youthink you can make this work, we'll allow you to make mom outof care during the pandemic andthen you can bring her back inwhen the pandemic is over.
No penalties.
and for those people who are athome now saying, you know what, if we got a call today and theysay can mom go in, but rightnow, we actually have thecapacity and the time becausewe're at home together.
If we can have a few more monthsto care for mom and wait untilthe pandemic ends, we've alsosaid if you make that choice, you will not be penalized.
That actually improves thecapacity and the system rightnow so that again, withhospitals overflowing, weactually have room.



**Rosemary**:

I have a coupleminutes, doctor, but what do you want Canadians to hear? Canadians who might not begetting it, Canadians who might be getting tired of it. What would you like them to hear from you?



Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a drill.
I wept last night and I'mworking double hours right now because we know what is coming.
This is all math.
We know that not everybody has been doing the physical distancing that the Prime Minister and our health officials have been asking us todo.
Some people are taking this lightly and please don't. I'm working these long hours all my colleagues are working these long hours, we know we could die in caring for you and we know this isn't easy.
Right now the hospital is quiet.
We're actually not that busy.
We know two weeks from now, my colleagues we're here we'reready but don't disappoint us. We all need to do our part.
Please, take this seriously.



**Rosemary**:

Anything else that you need us to do to support all of you?



You know, just look after each other and don't forget older people out there.
Especially who are scared, who are isolated, who because of this physical distancing can'tsee their loved ones.
If you have an older person in your neighbourhood, lockout forthem.
My friends have been great because they know I'm not eating much these days, so what do iget? I now get a ready-made meal tomake sure I seat.
Look after your health workersand each other and if you got asenior in your life, you know, seriously, reach out.
Don't touch them but reach outand look out for them too.



**Rosemary**:

Doctor, it's so good to make the time when you are working double shifts and doing such important work to keep us all healthy and safe.
I appreciate you speaking topeople.
I do think it makes a differencetoo.
Thank you so much.



Thank you, very much, rosemary.



**Rosemary**:

Thank you for all of your work.
Stay healthy and safe.



> all right.
Good to talk to front-linehealthcare workers during thistime.
As we all think about what morewe should be doing, they make itsimple.
Stay home, stay healthy, staysafe, reach out for people whomight be vulnerable and need alittle bit of extra support.
Some good advice there from thedoctor or the frontlines.
As we wait for our regularfederal briefing, I believewe're going to hear from Dr. Tamtoday and no cabinet ministerbut they will give us a pictureon how we're doing fighting thepandemic.
The federal government isworking on modeling it hopes toshare with Canadians.
The Prime Minister reminding all of you, people that have lostyour job due to COVID-19, tomorrow, you can start a publicapplying.
You can continue watching on CBC News network and cbc.
Ca.



**Rosemary**:

I want to bring ind avid Cochran as we wait for the chief public officer and her deputy today.
There was a good question today, David, to the Prime Minister and one that I have also been thinking about, about burn-outof government officials andpoliticians because if you arebriefing journalists everydayand you are working behind thescenes doing a million things, that is a real concern as well.
All of those people have to staystrong and healthy and the Prime Minister seemed to acknowledgethey are going to consider thatbecause he has now, I think onhis 20th OH 21st briefingand he outlasted me. I took a day off yesterday.
It's an issue that everyone hasto be conscious of. Frontline workers and publicservice workers, an amazingamount of work over a briefperiod of time.
So everybody needs to just thinkabout that, including us. Let's just talk about theemergency benefit just to remindpeople again what it is and thefact that it starts tomorrow.



The application process work goes live tomorrow and this is the promised date of April 6th, when they said the online portal would be ray.
Ready.
They can apply tomorrow and within three to five days ifit's direct deposit, they'll get2 to $4, 000 every week for the next six weeks and then we'llsee where we are as a country.
There was a concern whether thegovernment's it system can handle it and that's why it'sbeen moved.
There's a robust infrastructure to make it happen.
The last thing to happen is Otto go live tomorrow and crashes under the weight of the millions of Canadians who will be signing up to get in benefit.
This is the first of a wave of support programmes rolling out.
Some people will get on EU and at the end of the 16 weeks, they move to employment insurance andwe're waiting for thefine-printof the wage subsidy.
All of the same people workingbehind the scenes to get thesesystems up and running.



**Rosemary**:

and it is a realconcern, I think, and it should be for everybody, including the prime Minister.
The wage subsidy, 75% of wages, sort of back-stopped by thefederal government and we knowthat it was probably six weeks, I think, the finance ministersuggested from the time it islegislated until the time itgets to businesses.
So best the crb as you suggestedearlier could be a bridge forsome people but we don't knowwhen the house is coming back.
I haven't had an update on thatand we don't know how quicklythis is all going to unfold.
I think you have some details.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, we don'tknow when the house will comeback and the prime ministerwasn't asked about that today.
We know there are negotiations still ongoing between all of theparties.
They can still draft thelegislation, design the paymentsystem, start doing the inputs into how it will work spot computer system.
Into the computer system but they don'thave the power to press go until they get legislative authority.
If you look at the sheerambition, it's the biggest economic response programme in half century or more in Canada.
They're essentially nationalizing up to 75% of the payrolls to a certain amount because they want to have the government become the pay department for a lot of companies so they can keep their employees intact and stay on their benefit's programmes if they qualify.
When we get to a point where the social distancing and economiclock-down restrictions ease, companies can come back to lifefairly quickly because peopleare still working for them.
It's up to $870 per employee andthere is a cap on it. But three to six weeks is whatthe finance department has beensaying.
Six weeks at the outside, threeweeks if they can get it up andrunning that much quicker and iknow from talking to people whoown small businesses, threeweeks versus six weeks makes a big difference as to whether ornot they can stay going or relyonly things and come back upwhen that money is actuallyrolling in, especiallyrestaurants, for example, adapting to curbside pick-up ordelivery only from a sit-down-and eat model.
This is a real challenge forthem and the challenge form thegovernment, going back to thatburn-out question, the financedepartment is rolling out thewage subsidy and working on taxdeferrals and credit facilitiesand working with the banks tolower interest rates for peoplewho are in interest deferralbecause of all of this.
There are a million and onethings happening with theworkforce, working from home, physically distancing themselvesand it becomes a smaller andsmaller subset of the governmentwork on these things.
One part of the public servicewe event talked about are thepeople at global affair's canadarearranging with therepatriation sites and workingwith different time zones anddifferent travel restrictionsand airspace closure.
That is an absolutely massiverelief effort.
It's like a viral dunkirk goingon.



**Rosemary**:

Someone on twitter is asking me what time can we start applying on line.
I don't know the answer to that but I'll get it and tweet itout.
Let's go to Dr. Tam now.



There are 258 deaths.
The highest proportion among those 80 or older.
So, obviously, keeping seniors safe is a very critical part of what we need to do. and again, remember that these cases represent previousexposures, but we need to bethinking about what the risks are now and this means the best bet is to consider there could be community spread wherever you are and always practise physical distancing by keeping atwo-metre distance from others.
So Canada has completed over323, 000 tasks for people incanada and just over 4% of thesehave been confirmed as positive.
Each day we're adding to ourknowledge of COVID-19, keepingpace with new scientificevidence as it emerges.
This continues to be critical to how and when these decisions aretaken.
There are times when will actwith speed over perfection butin other times we must layer all of the protections that thescience has proven time andagain to work.
This is why I have been a brokenrecord about tried and truepublic health measures.
We know these work and that theycan plank the curve.
So we can all get it right.
Kids across Canada, what isflattening the curve? they are giving up soccer gamesand play dates and not going toschool to help plank the curveand they are learning aboutsocial distancing andhandwashing while singingdifferent tunes to help slow thespread of the virus.
This is great and we can all dothe same.
We know that these effortsrequire sacrifice, so we mustundertake them together, takingcare to look after one anotherand also to look after our ownphysical and mental well-being.
COVID-19 has reminded us of bothour vulnerablability andinterconnectedness.
We are stronger together.
Thank you.



Bonn jour.
(speaking french).



As usual we'll start with an update on the number of COVID-19cases in Canada.
There are now 14, 426 cases ofcovid-19 including 258 deaths.
Remember, these cases representprevious exposures, but we needto be thinking about risks now.
The best thing to do, to preventthe spread is practise physicaldistancing, assuming that therecould be community spread andkeeping a two-metre distancefrom others.
We continue to test at a highrate in Canada with testscompleted over over 324, 000people in Canada and just over4% of people have been confirmedpositive and 95% confirmed asnegative.
Each day, we are adding to ourknowledge of COVID-19, keepingpace with the rapid growth ofnew scientific evidence as itemerges.
This has been and continues to be critical to how and when newdecisions are taken.
Waiting for the science can beanxiety-provoking and there aretimes we act with speed overperfection when the price ofinaction is high.
In other cases, we must wait forscience to catch up whilethey're layering up with whatscience is proving to work.
and that's why we've been like abroken record about tried andintrude public health measures, because they are the certainty.
We know that they work and thatthey can plank the curve.
If we can all get it right.
Kids across the country areasking, what is flattening thecurve? they're giving up soccer gamesand play dates.
They're learning socialdistancing and handwashing whilesinging different tunes anddoing their part to help slowthe spread of the virus.
This is great and we can all dothe same.
We know that these effortsrequire sacrifice, so we mustundertake them together, takingcare to look at one another andalso to look at our own physicaland mental well-being.
COVID-19 has reminded us both of our vulnerability andinterconnectedness.
We are stronger together.
Thank you.



Thank you, doctors.
Do you want to open the line toquestions? we ask that you limit yourself to one question and only onefollowup.
For those asking a question in the room, we ask you make your way to the free-standing mics.
Operator to you for twoquestions on the line.



Thank you.
Please press star 1 at this time if you have a question.
There will be a brief pause.
Thank you for your patience.
(speaking french)please go ahead.



Good morning, Dr. Tam.
I'm wondering if you could talk little more about face masks.
You said many times Canada wants to be a lot more like southkorea and Taiwan but these are countries they were told to wear face masks earlier on. Are you concerned this information not given earlier



Whether someone issymptomatic, of course you should stay home and the question of the evolution of science on how muchpre-symptomatic conditions, forexample, contributes to theepidemic is still undergoing interms of evolution.
If people stay at home, ifyou're in quarantine, those 14days are there so that if youbecome symptomatic, you'realready a spatter from others.
So those are absolutely criticalmeasures.
Case finding, contact tracingand social distancing.
As I said yesterday, we areactively reviewing the evidenceright now with the province andterritories and we'll have morespecific recommendations in avery short time-frame.
I did say, though, there arethree critical aspects to ouradvice to Canadians and one isthat right now, medical masks, including surgical and medicalprocedural face masks, respirators must be kept forhealth workers and othersproviding direct care.
Secondly, again, nonmedicalmasks, so these are some of theexamples that people have talkedabout in terms of homemade masks in the community have beenproven to protect the personfrom getting the virus.
So everyone must still practisestraight hygienic measures andthe social distancing measures.
Stay home if you're sick.
Wearing a nonmedical mask is anadditional measure that we areconsidering to protect othersaround you.
So it's a matter of youprotecting others.
These are the three key aspectsand what we want to do is toprovide thoughtful advice tocanadians so that if they wear amask, how do you do thisproperly? and I want to make sure that wehave good advice even among homehome-made masks.
What materials are appropriate, for example.
So all of this is under activediscussion right now.



Thank you.



Thank you for that.
I'm also wondering if you could talk a little bit about protections for healthcareworkers.
We've heard in other countries the number of healthcare workers that falling sick is quite high and without the properprotection, what are you specifically trying to do to prevent those kinds of things from happening here? and why can't we know what the shortage is of masks for healthcare workers?



So protecting healthcare workers is absolute priority.
It is of paramount importance.
So as we've all been saying in every stop that's been pulled out in terms of getting supplies and globally, there is competitive environment and shortage environment.
So we are doing everything that we can, not just getting ppefrom overseas where traditionally that's where they come from, but the domesticsupply.
So some of these things are coming online and being delivered and everyday, those numbers will change and depending on the utilization of the mask and deliveries.
But we are also looking at othermeasures, such as how can wedisinfect, if you like, or decontaminate masks? how do we best look after the limits of supply that we have? and many of the other measures, for example, that provinces are taking is ensuring that they designate wards or hospitals just to look after COVID-19patients.
and that also helps to share inthe conservation of personalprotective equipment because itwill be one specific area, youone specific hospital wherepatients are being looked afterto look after the supply of theppe.
So many, many things are beingdone to ensure that we protecthealth workers and the otherthing is getting a betterunderstanding of the healthcareworkers who are infected.
I do know that, for example, it's not as simple as peoplethink.
Many healthcare workers were, perhaps, infected in the expector through travel and notnecessarily through the actualhealthcare facility.
So you need to actuallyunderstand that medical officersat the low level are there tounderstand the exact reason whyhealthcare workers have beeninfected but to protect thepatients they are trying to takecare of. So that's critical.



The next question is fromradio-Canada.
(speaking french).



Mr. Njoo, last week you said it was a critical week and now the week is over.
Did Canadians do what they needed to do? was the week, in your opinion, appositive one or a negative? answer, thank you for yourquestion.
It was a critical week last week and this week is a criticalweek, as well.
The issue this week, as well, is the data.
and what's happening with the data that we're receiving at the federal level.
It represents cases of exposure from two, three and four weeksback.
So there's always an incubationperiod.
Someone then gets sick, seeks at est and there at the stages andefforts.
So these efforts are underway at municipal level and shows it grows at the provisional level, as well.
It's difficult to determine precisely if we were successful, but we're monitoring what'shappening in the individual provinces and territories andwe're seeing in britishcolumbia, for example, that health authorities have said that their results are, perhaps, optimistic, but they're being cautiously optimistic andnationally, it's more difficult and I think the most important thing to do at this point is for all Canadians to continue with physical distancing.
For the next couple of weeks, especially.
Thank you.



Followup question.
Yes, followup question.
With respect to masks, last week the Quebec government said that they needed a couple of million surgical masks and some millionn95 masks for Quebec alone across Canada now.
Do you have an indication as to how many masks are required and can you compare that with the masks that will be coming in from china? will there be enough? will it serve us for a couple of days or how many days will we be covered with the incoming masks? thank you for the question.
That is another issue everyone is working at the federal government level in cooperation with all of the provinces andterritories.
We have a team Canada approach.
We are placing both orders an dafter that we have distribution to the provinces and territories based on framework.
and we know that there are some outbreak areas in the province sand territories and those areas are priority destinations set for the ppe.
To the areas where the outbreak is more serious.
But it's difficult.
We can't provide exact figures because the situation is very fluid with the flights, thedistribution.
If we give you a figure now, Ina few moments, a few hours, it may no longer be the up-to-datefigure.
So what we continue to say isthat we continue to work inclose cooperation.
The situation is fluid andevolving day over day and we'redoing our best.
Even if we continue to buywhat's available on the globalmarket, we're also continuingour efforts to enhance ourdomestic capacity to producemasks here for frontline workerson the ground.
Another aspect in Canada isresearch.
We're looking at ways ofdisinfecting personal protectiveequipment already used and thatmay be another way of preservingthe equipment we already have incanada.
So we're working on severalfronts at the same time on theissue of use and distribution ofthis equipment across thecountry.



Thank you.



Same question, obviously, drnrepeating.
It's a live issue in terms of getting the necessary personal protection issue for ourfrontline workers, especially healthcare wokerrers.
Wokers.
It's difficult to give exact numbers because it's competitive market.
We're pulling out all of thestops.
We have an allocation framework so that when masks do arrive, there's a mechanism in terms of how we would distribute.
Obviously, there are a lot of factors in play.
If a given part of the country has a specific outbreak or region that's particularlyaffected, certainly that would be a priority to get the masks that are available to that specific area.
In addition to, obviously, the very competitive global market, we're looking at increasing our domestic capacity.
That won't happen overnight but efforts are underway to make sure here in Canada we have thecanada down the road, hopefully sooner than later, to make our own personal protectiveequipment.
That's number two.
Number three, we're actively, with our researchers across the country looking at other ways that maybe we can even reutilizemasks as Dr. Tam was just saying in terms of disinfecting them Southey could be used again so we could conserve the Poe we ha vein Canada.
Thank you.



Thank you, we'll come to the room for two questions.



Thank you.
Dr. Tam, when I asked you aboutmasks, you said the main reason someone wasn't sick at that point or showing symptoms was to wear a mask and not give droplets to someone else.
That made it seem like there was science looking at asymptomatictransmission.
Can you speak to what the science is right now and very specifically on that, in the period before someone showssymptoms, how early are they able to spread COVID-19?



So we are actually right now going to be reviewing this with the other chief medical officer sand in terms of the studiesavailable.
They're actually limited so withthat, we will still be making some recommendations.
What we do know is if you put Aswan into someone's nose andthroat, you will get the virus identified before someone issymptomatic.
So that is a fact that we knowabout.
and when someone transmits, that's is the more difficultquestion.
So there has been some studies, some of which have been release din the last few days.
For example, a study in along-term care facility in the United states is showing thatpeople who are pre-symptomatic, they will become symptomatic butmaybe two days or so, so we'relooking at that, too.
How certain are we about one totwo days, two to three days, looking at that period that theycould transmit before they havesymptoms.
We still believe people withsymptoms is the main forceoverall for the propagation ofthe actual outbreak.
But in certain settings, as youcan imagine, like long-termcare, it's really vital to lookat that because it can changepractise including the use ofppe so that staff may notrealize that they will becomesymptomatic.
All residents under medicalconditions, for example, youcan't tell.
There are other things that wemaybe should be doing, as well.
So that's the live discussionwe're having and we will beproviding more information onthat to come.
There's also other laboratoriesstudies where people are made tocough or do other things to seewhether they can spread and sothere's different groups ofstudies that we're looking atright now.



a followup.



President trump has become discussing the anti malaria drug of hydroxychloroquine as potential treatment for this.
What is Canada's position on this and have we used this drug to treat people in Canada at any point during this and it's also drug used for lupus.
What are we doing to make sure this drug is set aside to make sure people who need it for conditions that we know it will actually help, to make sure those drugs are there for them?



That's a very good question.
We do not have any specifictreatments, none proven to work for COVID-19. But hydroxychloroquine is onethat's being studied.
In Canada, we are a part of those studies and ensuring that we have hydroxychloroquine so that people who use it and get data from them is part of what'sgoing on right now.
In terms of absolutely, I think our key message is that we do know this drug works for certain medical conditions.
People with an inflammatoryillnesses, some of the immunological illnesses you'vetalked about.
Malaria, you must preserve those actual indications so that we are working on that with healthcanada.
That's the regulatory authority, that's the manufacturers, and there are several of them.
and some are manufactured incanada.
So we are monitoring the supply situation and looking to what we need for the purposes of patients who need them and the trials that need to beconducted.
But it's definitely one on the list of treatments that we are looking at for COVID-19.



You just said you'remonitoring the supply of that specific drug.
Do we rely on a large bulk of that from the United States?



I know there are several supplies and I know that there'sdomestic manufacturing.
I also know there's a great deal of interest globally.
So we realize the supply that we making sure we have enough ofthrother purposes is our primary concern right now and I think from My perspective, at least, we have domestic capacity.



You were just talking about decontaminating and disinfectingpass.
Can you give us specifics of what type of work your doing right now and how close we are to do this? and how does this signal the supply right now?



I think everyone is aware that the supply is a very dynamic situation and this is another method.
This is part of what works.
and secondly, we're looking at multiple entities in Canada that might be able to do this.
and also, then signaling to provinces and territories that certain things shouldn't be thrown away right now.
So that we can actually implement this should we find the actual people who can dothis.
I think this is one of the most important and worthwhile lines to pursue for Poe right now.



We'll go to the line for two final questions.



Dr. Tam, you said last week this would be a critical week in terms of cases and numbers.
We have heard from British Columbia andalberta indicating they may be seeing a slow-down.
On the contrary, it seems thesituation in Ontario and quebecare suffering.
I was wondering if you couldcomment on some of thesituations might be evolving andwhat you'll be looking for inthe week ahead.



I think that's actually Good summary.
We will be looking towardsbritish Columbia and maybealberta because they have a very different epidemiology to quebecand Ontario.
I think all chief medical officers are trying to be extremely cautious of what we'relooking at because we know the situation can change and with the delay in terms of what you are seeing right now in terms ofnumbers, again, is what happened several weeks ago.
and so that is absolutely important for everyone to know.
and as I've said before, youwon't know that you've passed ascertain peak until you're on the other side of it and it's always very difficult to make any pronunciation on that.
It's a day-by-day look.
I think Quebec and Ontario, evenindividually, have differentepidemiology and different timesand trajectories.
So Quebec's dynamics would bedifferent than Ontario and we'llbe watching each of thedifferent provinces carefully, as well.
and we think they may havestarted a bit later than britishcolumbia in their epidemic as well.
So the timing of when we willsee the measures, I think, willbe a bit different across thecountry.



Thank you and one followup.



Sure.



So maybe looking forward, how concerned are you if we continue to see the hospitalization andicu numbers jump the way they currently are in Ontario andquebec?



So I think, again, the exposures to those individuals would have happened at least couple of weeks ago.
So what happens is we do have to look at everything again on daily basis because I'm aware that each of the jurisdiction shave laid on more additional measures in the meantime.
So you will be seeing the impact of what happened a couple of weeks ago and then there's even more measures being done sincethen.
and so, I think we have to be able to watch this day-by-day.
Just to really emphasize at whatthings happened in the nextensuing weeks is because of whathappens today.
So if we don't keep on going andtighten up our socialdistancing, self-isolation, casecontact measures, that's what'sgoing to impact a couple ofweeks down the road.
So that is a really importantconcept that everybody has tograsp.
What will happen two weeks downthe road is what happens today.
So it's just a concept that ithink Canadians need to be awareof.



One final question on theline.



The next question is canadaradio.
(speaking french).



Good morning, doctors.
My question is the federal government emulating how some countries are providing accommodation for healthcare workers so they can minimize any contact between them and people around them? is the federal government considering anything close tothat?



We are looking at everything, basically, to slow down the spread of the virus and this epidemic and so these are some of the kind of discussions that we do have with provinces andterritories.
That's a very good question and if you looked at what the province is already doing, I'maware, for example, Manitoba, should they need a place toself-isolate, to not justprotect themselves by theirfamilies, they are looking atthe support for them to do so. and so absolutely.
That's one aspect of a responsethat we can offer support forshould that be needed.



Thank you, and one followup.



Thank you, I don't have afollowup.
Thank you so much, doctors.



That concludes the pressconference.



The conference has now ended.



**Rosemary**:

That was a daily federal briefing from Dr. Tam and her deputy, Dr. Njoo, about the state of a pandemic in thiscountry.
I'll bring in David Cochran.
a couple of interesting points.
Let's start, David, with masks.
Not only the lack of, but the advice on, because it does sound like this is an ongoingconversation.



**Reporter**:

Yeah, there's couple of things going on with masks and really the conversation is about money, masks and modeling, but onmasks, obviously efforts to getsupply, as we ramp up to build domestic supply chain where masks can be manufactured incanada for Canadian knees with surplus going globally.
That's the status we're in rightnow.
and some discussion that the university of Manitoba, researchers there are working with the national microbiology lab to come up with a process of disinfectant that could be allowed up to ten times.
a good story on global news, on their web page about this and this is something Dr. Tam say sis important and worthwhile pursuit to extend the life ofppe material.
How do we extend the life of the ones in use? how do we get more on the globalmarket? and ramping up the domestic quality of Canada to create amade-in-Canada solution? there's the ongoing questionsabout whether people should wearmasks when they go out inpublic.
Not n95 masks, but home-madecloth masks because anythingthat contains the explosion ofdroplets should you knees or snrcough is reducing communityspread even if you're asymptomatic.
This has been part of an effortto attack the virus.
This is stacked on top of theaggressive handwashing, thetesting and the tracing whichyou see being done aggressivelyin germany, which has hadsuccess in dealing with this.
Dr. Tam says that science isevolving on this, that more andmore people are coming to theconclusion it would be a goodcreated.
We have colleagues that areconvinced this is a good ideaand they should be doing thisall of the time but they need toknow what materials TKO use andhow and when to use this and hownot to use this as a substitutefor all of the the othermeasures getting to the pointwhere we can flatten the curveas a country.
As you look at the provisionaldata, you're seeing positivesigns out of the britishcolumbia and Alberta, someworrying signs in Ontario andquebec in a week where we'reexpecting the federal governmentto release a big national modelon all of this.



**Rosemary**:

Right.
and just a final point on themasks, the CDC, of course, in the United States, says hey, if you want to wear a mask, it might help you.
It's not an order.
But they are continuing to speak with her provisional counterparts and we'll hear mo rein a short time.
I want to make a final point about the emergency relief benefit because My trusting producer Phil, looked into what that would be open.
Everybody who wants accesstomorrow, it opens at 6:00 a. M. eastern tomorrow.
They want to stagger who is applying when, so if you go on the website and you check your birth month, it will tell you what day you should sign up. If you are eligible for ei, you can apply through EU and you'llbe switched over to the emergency relief benefit ifyou've applied for ei. Modern information for tomorrow morning and David Cochran, thank you for all of your help and appreciate it very much.
Another big piece of news that will happen later today is when the queen will address the impact of the COVID-19 in aspeech.
For more on this, I want to bring in Dominic valitis inbristol.
This is a big deal and doesn'thappy very often.



**Reporter**:

Yes, an extremely rare event for the queen to make public address to the britishpeople.
I think it's only happened handful of times, really, during the queen's 68-year reign.
When you look at the history backs and go back to the outbreak of the first war back in 1991, we had an address them, and that was the death ever princess Diana in 1997 and then the queen mother's funeral.
and following the course of the annual traditional christmasmessage, it's rare for her to dothis.
We know that the decision was made in close consultation with downing street.
The timing is significant here.
We are about to hit a very grim milestone in terms of the number of deaths in the United Kingdom, a couple short of 5, 000.
By the end of today, we will have reached that.
So the timing is significant.
What else can I tell you aboutit? we know it was prerecorded.
It was recorded on Thursday at the Windsor castle.
She normally spends easterthere, but she arrived about a week ahead of schedule thisyear.
She left London early because of the coronavirus.
and this address was filmed by as ole cameraman who won't full protective clothing and it will be broadcast on television, on radio and online, on the royal'sonline channel.
This is a couple of weeks after prince Charles is summoned next in line and had the coronavirusbut is in good health now.



**Rosemary**:

We had a good sense of what she will say to bolster people as they're social distancing and self-isolating.



**Reporter**:

Yes, that's right.
This will be a message of unity to the British people, as well as staff and front-line workersand we are expecting her toacknowledge the grief and thepain and the financialdifficulties that britain iscurrently facing.
But we know she'll emphasize therole that individuals in societycan play to make an impact onthis outbreak.
We can actually show you now ataste of what she'll say.
She'll say I hope that in theyears to come, everyone willtake pride in how they respondedto this challenge and those whocome after us that will say thebritains of this generation wereas strong as any, and theattributes of self-discipline, of quiet good humoured resolveand a fellow feeling stillcharacterize at this country.
For me, rosie, the key messagein that short extract is amessage of resolve andself-discipline.
I can't help but wonderpersonally if that's notdirected towards those peoplewho are fortunately here in theUnited Kingdom are still flouting thesocial isolation and socialdistancing.
So I think the key message is aparticular problem again thisweekend because we've had quitefine spring weather.
We're at a point now,.



**Rosemary**:

Rosie, that the government is considering banning exercise outdoors and that could be the next step we face here in the united kingdom in terms of the restrictionswe're all under.
We're about to hit this rather grim milestone of 5, 000 deaths here this the United Kingdom



**Rosemary**:

Dominic valitis in Bristol.
We're have special coverage of the queen's address on cbctelevision and CBC newsnetwork." the queen will speak at3:00 eastern and we'll bring you that address when it happens, as well as analysis, because if the queen is talking about resolve, she certainly embodies that fora lot of people and we will bring that address to you and talk to you about things they'redoing in England, of course, asdominick was talking about.
The other part of this and the prime Minister has eluded to it almost everyday that he's spoken to Canadians, is how to deal with kids and getting this message through to your kids.
Indeed, he spoke to CBC kids and answered some questions there.
But it's something many people are obviously struggling with.
It can be a fine balancing act between reassuring, communicating, being really honest about what's happening out there.
Karen Irwin is in collingwood, Ontario and they're all there.
Good to see you all.
Charlie, I think it's yourbirthday.



Yeah.



**Rosemary**:

Happy birthday.
I think you're three today.
That's big.



Are you three?



Yeah.
[ laughter ]



**Rosemary**:

I'm not super interesting to charlie, butkaren, tell me, first of all, how are your kids doing and ho ware you all managing with this.



We're managing as best we can.
Obviously we have highs andlows, but we just take itday-by-day.



**Rosemary**:

What is your best advice on how to explain all ofthis? and you have to because life is so different.



You're right.
I think it's really important parents to talk to their kids about what's going on. One thing I'm aware of is try to have an ongoing conversation about it because things are constantly evolving and I think the more our kids are aware, in the know, the better they can manage and cope with all thischange.
So try to have check-in pointswith them.
When you have new information, share that with them and I alsorecommend for parents to beclear and concise and don't givetoo much jargon.



**Rosemary**:

How do you knowwhat's age appropriate, the seriousness of it and it could affect your family and how do you walk that fine line? especially if you have people of different ages in your house.



In our house, I would say have two separate conversations, one with the older two and one with charlie and the older two.
With the 3-year-old, I face onthe changes that are affectinghim personally.
We won't be going to school.
We'll be spending more timetogether as a family.
We'll be playing with yoursiblings.
and I say, is the reason isbecause of something called thecoronavirus.
and I keep it at that level.
With My older two, though, iexplain it a little bit moreabout what the corus is, how itspreads from one person to theother and then, also, keepingthem up to date and informedabout school and, you know, whenit might start again, eventhough that's a hard thing totell them.



**Rosemary**:

Maybe one final piece of advice for parents feeling stressed because the kids get too much screen time and they feel also a lot going on and they're trying to do their jobs in parents and those are two separate jobs.
What would you say to parents in.



My number one tip is every morning have we what call the morning huddle, where we establish the plan for the day and when you're establishing that plan, tell your kids whenthey're going to get screentime, when you need them to keep themselves busy because you have to be on a work call, whenyou'll do something together as family activity.
The more information we give ourkids, the better they'll cope and manage because they'll be in the know.



**Rosemary**:

I'll put max on the spot.
How is your mom do so far, do you think?



Good! [ laughter ]



**Rosemary**:

and how are youdoing, max? are you bored yet?



It's fun.



**Rosemary**:

You're not sick of your family yet?



No.



**Rosemary**:

How about you, Louise? how are you doing.



Good.



**Rosemary**:

Do you miss yourfriends, Louise? yes.



**Rosemary**:

I hear ya, me, too.
Thank you all.
I appreciate it. This is an important part ofwhat's happening.
Hang in there and stay healthy.



Goodbye, thanks.



**Rosemary**:

Take care, thankyou.
It's good because everybody is coping with that kind of stuff at home if you've got kids.
Kids are pretty resilient as you can see from those three.
I will be back later for coverage of the queen's address and the words and advice she plans to give people around theworld.
and we will, of course, be back here tomorrow for more coverage of how the federal government is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
For now, though, Michael serapiowill continue in a few moments.
I'm rosemary Barton and thank you for watching.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Take care.
