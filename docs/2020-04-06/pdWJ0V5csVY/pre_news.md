Doing so is consistent with the United states policy and in the national interest of the United States, so of course, that's going to raise a lot of questions for Canada.
It seems that the aim of the order, how it was worded last night, has to do with people profiteering and sending it out of the United States to make a profit.
That seems to be what the president was talking about in his statement.
But what does this concretely mean for Canadians? as you mentioned, Justin Trudeau mentioned yesterday he thinks this would be a mistake.
Some questioning what he was saying yesterday, even though it was said in a very, let's say, even tempered tone, even though it might have been a threat.
He said thousands of nurses go from Canada to the Detroit health care system every day, and he says making this move would be a mistake.
He says that the Canadian government is reaching out to their counterparts here in the United States, the president trying to influence people around him, everything from governors to people in the white house, hoping that is going to work.
You've got to think that depending on how things play out, the stakes are higher than ever before.

I've been trying to figure out and ascertain if 3-mdetermines they can no longer ship n95 masks -- we should qualify, those are the masks that doctors and nurses use that keep out 95% of the viruses and germs out.
How big is the supply of 3-m masks of the overall supply of this country? I have yet to get an answer.
a Minister last night used the word "significant." I guess that 3-m is one of only two manufacturers in the United States that manufacture n95 masks, so it's a huge player in the supply.



3-m in the United States talks about masks for Canada and Latin America as the ones that they're exporting right now.
The c. E.o. Of the United States company says on humanitarian grounds, he needs to keep exporting these masks because they are the major supplier.
Does that apply to Canada? is 3-m the major supplier for those masks to our country? canadian officials refusing to talk about that, and I think we can understand that when we look at the global picture, what's going on in terms of securing personal protective equipment.
The term that's used over and over again in this scenario is this looks a lot like the wild west.
There are all kinds of wild stories of ship loads of masks being bought off the tarmac, headed for one country, destined to another.
The premier of Quebec saying yesterday that his province hasabout eight days of supply.
That province is struggling in that regard.
We know that there's a nationalstock pile, and what seems to be consensus from the provincesand the Prime Minister, the provinces that are struggling the most are the ones that willget them first.
We heard doug ford talking yesterday, about let's build upthe national capacity.
and the raw materials, some of them that use to make these masks, some of them come from British Columbia



**Vassy**:

Thanks so much, Catherine.
Our viewers can see the shot upthere.
We are awaiting the Prime Minister's comments on this issue, and also, an announcement around money that has already been announced for shelters and more vulnerable Canadians during this pandemic.
We'll find out where that money is expected to go. But for more on these n95 masks, I want to bring in one of our Washington correspondents, Steven d'souza.
Tell us more why the United States president is doing this.
I read yesterday the country needs 3 billion masks to go through this pandemic.
That's a figure that I read from the department of health and human services.



**Reporter**:

Well, it's interesting because the president is facing a lot of backlash from states who are saying that they're simply not getting the supplies that they need from the federal government and the government isn't doing a good enough job coordinating from the national stock pile, and that caused a little push back from Jared kushner made an appearance at the Daley briefing and said that the national stock pile is ours.
It shouldn't be for the states, when in fact, what it is is for the federal government to deliver to the states.
There was some discover because the federal government website gave that very description, saying it should be sent to thestates, changed its wording the next day.
They said that change was in the pipeline, any way.
The president has invoked the defence protection act, mainly targeting what he said was the overall sort of marketplace, what Catherine mentioned, as well.
States are complaining that when they go to companies, when they go to distributors to bid for these supplies, these personal protective supplies, they're getting outbid by the federal government, and prices are being driven up by the federal government.
and then, on the international level, Germany, for example, accusing of United States of stealing 200, 000 surgical masks destined from china.
France and Brazil say they're getting outbid on the international marketplace by the United States as Catherine said, you know, the term "wild west" is being thrown around out there, and countries are bidding against each other, sometimes bidding within the country, and it's just not clear who's coordinating things and where the supplies are getting to. But when you hear from front line workers, they're saying it's not reaching them.
Some people saying what they'regetting from the national stockpile in the United States, it expired ten years ago or a lot of it is dealing with Dr. rot.
a lot of the decisions that the United States president is making is having a ripple effect on many countries, like Canada.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, thank you.
That was the cbc's Steven d'souza.
We are awaiting remarks from the topic we've been discussing, the president's order to stop 3-m from exporting n95 masks to Canada.



Hi, Vassy.
Nice to see you.
Thanks for having me.



**Vassy**:

Let me ask you flat out, is there any chance the president changes his mind on this?



Absolutely.
The president changes his mind a lot on many things, so yes.
We saw this, Vassy, during the -- in a different situation much less dire, but we saw during the negotiations of the new north American free trade agreement, the president would make these statements, and the administration would scramble to keep up. But in the end, we got a betteragreement, and he had to walk back a lot of the things he said.
This was a time when manufacturers and governments need to work together to solve the problems and meet the needs, and I think it's a -- it's not a great dynamic between the president and 3-m right now.



**Vassy**:

You were well acquainted with the team canadaapproach during NAFTA negotiations.
We understand something similar is in the works right now.
Your advice to government officials or what do you think might work in order to try to get the president to change hismind?



Well, look.
The team Canada approach that'sbeen in place the last year and half for the trade negotiations was good.
Provinces pulled together, and Canada reminded the United States and Mexico why it was a good thing to trade together.
We need each other, and it's not possible to unscramble this egg of domestic dependability.



**Vassy**:

I consume as much news from south of the border as anyone else in the Canada, and what we see is a discrepancy to meet the needs of various states.
We see one governor saying I got what I need, and another saying I need more.
We see that on a lesser level from the different provinces, but what is the president doing on different levels to try to stop the spread of this virus?



Well, this situation calls for a very coordinated approach on the industrial response, so the defence production act, which came around in the 1950s that the president has referred to I think is not meant to be aone-off reaction for one community or one neighborhood or one state.
What's needed is a real coordinated approach.
Like in Canada, the Prime Minister talks to premiers and tries to coordinate.
I think we're going to need to see more of that here so that it's not reactionary and it's not pitting one community against another, but it's figuring out how we can help those who need it most.



**Vassy**:

Okay.
I'll leave it there.
Good to see you, scotty.



Good to see you, too, Vassy.



**Vassy**:

One other thing I just want to touch on before the Prime Minister steps out those doors, another series of questions that he's touched on this week is modelling around forecasting, presenting various scenarios to Canadians, what do you expect from there today?



Well, I think he's going to be pushed to release the national models.
It's something he's said he is willing to do and talked about aligning all the data from across Canada in order to be able to provide the most accurate possible model, I suppose.
At the same time, he and his officials are looking at information right now, and a lot of Canadians are wondering about specifically bouncing off of that yesterday.
I think one of the questions that comes out of Ontario's projections has to do what we're talking about here, Vassy.
Ontario talking about a secondary wave, possibly a tertiary wave in the coming months.
I think we've heard the Prime Minister talk about things in terms of weeks, even months.
When we talk about a broader scenario that plays out over the course of years, or at least a couple of years, we've seen the Prime Minister talking about that front, and of course when is the national data going to be ready to talk to Canadians about?



**Vassy**:

and he has always answered those questions with the caveat that our behaviours now will really determine what that projection ends up confirming, rather than the various scenarios.
But I think you're right.
The big headline out of premierford's conference and the health officials of Ontario was this projected timeline of 18 to 24 months, and it's very different from other timelines from the Prime Minister, whether it's rhetorical or not, it's weeks or months.
You're wondering if they are considering if we have to undertake these social distancing and physical measures for more than a few months.



Well, I believe it was Dr. Theresa tam who raised the idea of a second wave.
There are conversations going on behind the scenes that would involve a second wave, maybe even a third wave.
What does that look like? part of that has to do -- we can see the Prime Minister coming out right now, but the Prime Minister has talked about the need for radical honesty.
We need those questions and theanswers.



**Vassy**:

Let's listen in to the Prime Minister.
Here's the Prime Minister.
