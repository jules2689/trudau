**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

You're worried about your job or your business.
You're concerned about the health or the health of an elderly parent.
No matter what this is for you, you need answers, and where we might be in the coming weeks and months is how we can all figure out your response.
For you, that can be planning on how to make sure the kids keep learning, even though we're at home.
For the government, the number sand data compiled by our experts are critical to understanding the scope of this pandemic and informing the decisions we make to keep you safe.
and we've made sure you can access the most reliable, accurate information available to us at Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
We're going to keep releasing up-to-date data on a daily basis and using it to inform our decisions.
and we'll continue working withthe provinces and territories on getting new information to have a complete national picture that we'll share with you.
Regardless of the varying models and predictions, one thing is consistently clear.
The measures that have been putin place by all orders of government, from closing schools to staying home, are saving lives.
But this will only keep workingif everyone continues to do their part, if everyone takes their duty to the nurses and doctors, to the elderly and to the vulnerable seriously, as seriously as if it were the life of their parent or their child on the line because it is. The cashier at the store is someone's brother.
The paramedic saving lives is someone's wife.
That's what's at stake here.
The lives of the people we love, the lives of the people our neighbours love.
So do your part.
Wash your hands, stay two metres away from each other, and above all, stay home.


[speaking french language]



For a number of weeks now, we have been staying home, in addition to keep our distance and washing our hands.
In fact it's at home that most of us feel the safest right at this time.
But just imagine if you were more afraid to stay home than to confront the pandemic.
Unfortunately, that is the reality for too many Canadians.
It is their daily experience, women who are fleeing violence.
No women should have to choose between keeping her children Ina house where they're not safe or taking them to a place where they could fall sick.
We therefore invested $40 million in shelters for women and centres that help women facing violence.
For women and indigenous women and children, we have invested $10 million in emergency shelters.
This money will help women's shelters to take all the necessary measures to help protect people against violence but also against COVID-19. To help the homeless, we increased by more than $157 million the funding of the programme to help the homeless.
People will be able to buy new beds or rent new facilities to help them, and we know that there are centres like this in all the major cities.
It's not just about helping people to avoid violence or protecting them from sleeping in the streets.
We must protect all members of society from COVID-19.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

No one should have to choose between staying safe and getting COVID-19. That's why we've invested $40 million in sexual assault centres across the country.
and for indigenous women across the country, we've invested $10million.
The communities that need this funding have now been identified and money is getting to them.
For people from Victoria to Hamilton and Regina to st. John's, help has arrived.
I know we're asking a lot rightnow.
Staying home, not seeing friends, closing your business, it's not easy.
I get that, but these sacrifices are necessary.
The price of acting otherwise is just too steep.
For those who are sick right now or who have families in I. C.u., to those who have lost a loved one or a friend, we're thinking of you, we're here foryou, and you remind us of what's on the line.
We all need to take physical distancing very seriously.
Done right, these measures willsave lives and bridge us slowlybut surely back to normal.
At the same time, we're workingaround the clock to get Canada the resources we need.
In the next 48 hours, we will be receiving a shipment of millions of masks by a chartered cargo flight.
We're also working with provinces to transport their medical supplies when possible.
Items ordered by Quebec will beon this flight.
Our government has also leased a warehouse in china to help collect and distribute these items as quickly as possible.
The efforts to get these items here include canadian airlines, cargo flights, and chartered jets.
I want to take a moment, whether you're flying the planeor part of the ground crew, foryour dedication.



**Vassy**:

It looks like we have bit of a technical difficultythere.
I'll just recap until we get things fixed -- oh, I hear him now.
We'll send you back there.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're doing everything we can to support you while you do your part.
So this weekend, stay at home.
Protect your loved ones and ourfront-line workers.
Save lives.
I want to take a moment to talkto kids again today.
Even at home, there's lots of stuff going on, there's lots ofstuff to do. I'll be holding a video conference tomorrow with Dr. Tam to talk through some of your questions.
I know a lot of you have sent them in, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, you'll have a chance to ask someone who knows betterthan anyone else staying inside, an astronaut.
Tomorrow, jeremy hansen, an astronaut, will be here to talkto you, so ask your parents to send in questions ahead of time.


[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

For kids, I know you have a lot of questions, so tomorrow, you can talk to Dr. Tam, where we will be answering your questions, and astronaut Jeremy Hansen, will be on-line tomorrow.
We have developed a three-part plan to protect jobs, support small and medium-sized businesses, and protect your finances.
To protect our health, we've worked with frontline workers and companies to distribute medical equipment and P.P.E. We will come through.
We will come through the storm, but we need you to do your share.
I know I can rely on you to do that.
This weekend, stay home and save our frontline workers.
Save lives.
Thank you.



Thank you.
We'll now take questions from the phone.
As a reminder, one question, one follow up. Operator?
