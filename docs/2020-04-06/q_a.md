**Caller**:

Thank you.
The first question is from Teresa wright from the canadianpress.
The line is open.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister.
Yesterday in response to questions about the United States order for companies to stop exporting the n95 masks, you mentioned the nurses who go from Windsor to Detroit every day.
is Canada considering stopping those nurses from going to the United States as a retaliatory measures?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

No. We realize our countries are interlinked in sometimes very complex ways.
The flow of goods back and forth across our border keep us safe and help us on both sides of the border.
We are continuing to engage in constructive discussions with indifferent levels of the administration to highlight that the United States will be hurting itself as much as Canada will be hurting if we see an interruption of essential good sand services flow back and forth across the border.
We continue to demonstrate that this is a good thing for both of our countries, and we look to continue to ensure that essential supplies get across the border.



**Reporter**:

How concerned are you that those arguments at that pace that you're trying to make could be falling on deaf ears?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We've had extremely constructive discussions with the Americans over the past weeks throughout this crisis, and we continue to get very good response from them on thisissue, as well.



Thank you.
Next question, operator.



**Caller**:

Thank you, Merci.
The next question is from rob ruttier from United States news.
The line is open.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister, Prime Minister Kenny said he will take part in next week's OPEC call.
Will you take part in that call, as well?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

As you know, that call for Monday has been cancelled.
We're continuing to look at how we can make sure Canada's voice is heard during these negotiations.



**Reporter**:

and to what level is your country holding off on these packages during these global supply cuts?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We're continuing to look at oil and gas workers that are suffering, but at the same time, we moved forward early on in direction support for workers across all industries.
The wage subsidy and the CERB will be there to support Canadians who have fallen on difficult times because of COVID-19. 

[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We have to ensure that we can help workers in those industries that have been affected in the oil and gas sector, and we will be looking at how we can do that in the next little while.
At the same time, I want to say that the measures we have put forward, whether it's the wage subsidy or the Canada emergency response benefit will help people in all those industries right across the country who have fallen on hard times because of COVID-19.



Next question, operator.



**Caller**:

Thank you, Merci.
The next question is from Catherine.



**Reporter**:

Prime Minister Trudeau, I'd just like to come back to what you said about the masks that will be coming to Canada soon.
You said that will be the ones ordered for Quebec.
Are those from 3-m?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Those are currently from china.
We are working to make sure that the supply chain between china and Canada continues to operate, and that is the order that I referred to.



**Reporter**:

Thank you.
and coming back to Mr. Trump, iwondered, did you call him or do you intend to call presidenttrump, and is there any other way -- perhaps use the new NAFTA -- that we could do something about the masks?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, since the crisisbegan, I've been speaking regularly with the United States president, and I intend to speak to him again very soon.
But for the time being, the discussions are being held at various levels of the administration, and we're pointing out to them that essential goods and services flow across the border on both sides.
We have nurses who work on the other side of the border, and in terms of gloves and other type of equipment and test kits, the fact is we've supplied that type of equipment to the United States.
Our economies are so interconnected that it would really hurt both countries to block that supply chain.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

I will be speaking to president trump in the coming days.
I have spoken to him a number of times over the past weeks since the virus started to really hit hard.
We're continuing to engage at all levels of the administration, continuing to have constructive discussions, highlighting that the flow of goods to our countries happen back and forth, and it is in both of our interests to maintain this extraordinary close relationship.



Thank you, and we'll take one more question on the phone, operator.



**Caller**:

Thank you, Merci.
We have a question from Michelle la mash.
Your line is now open.
[speaking french language]



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Prime Minister Trudeau.
I'd like to know if you've spoken about the American officials that the pulp and paper used to use those n95 masks comes from British Columbia.
If you talked to them about that? have you reflected on that withthem?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Yes.
We have pointed out to the United States all the different materials and services that flow back and forth across the border.
We do not want to start limiting our exports or the services that we provide to the United states.
We understand that both of our countries will be much better off if we continue to count on each other, and I'm confident that we will be able to find a solution to this situation.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We have highlighted in many different ways the very different products and resources that flow across the border in both directions to ensure success for our economies, success in keeping our citizens safe.
We are not looking at retaliatory measures or measures that are punitive.
We know that it is in both of our interests to continue to work collaboratively and cooperatively to keep our citizens safe, and that's very much the tenor of our conversations, and I'm confident that we're going to get there.


[speaking french language]



**Reporter**:

Mr. Trudeau, I know you're aware of the scenarios yesterday.
Do they -- the Ontario's scenario yesterday.
Do they represent the scenarios of all of Canada?



Yes.
--



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Yes.
We are working on getting the rest of the provinces' scenarios, and answer the question that every Canadian has: how serious will this become and when can we cutback on some of the measures currently in place? but I just want to say every model, every prediction, every projection is based on the fact that we must stay home, we must limit our movements, we must keep a two-metre distance from others.
This action will help Canadians, and it will help ensure whatever model we're talking about, we will get the best possible results, and there will be the least amount of damage and the fewest deathspossible.
Now, there will be more modelling and data released in the next few days, but in the meantime, it's important for Canadians to look at what the numbers are, and we're waiting for numbers from the provinces.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We saw modelling from Ontario yesterday.
We know we'll be getting modelling from Quebec in the coming days.
Canada will continue to pull together the information and make models and scenarios base don that.
But regardless of the models and all of that, one thing remains constant.
The more that people stay at home, don't go out, and if theydo, practice social distancing, and wash their hands, the better things will be. We continue to share information at Canada.
Ca/coronavirus.
We continue to share information from all across theprovinces, and we will continueto build and share our scenarios from the provinces for a view of Canada at a whole.



**Reporter**:

a report yesterday said we could be in this potentially from one to three years, and there will be a second and even a third wave onthis.
Are the models that Ontario put forward consistent from what you've seen so far?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We've seen models like that and more.
We know the situation is serious, and we know the range of possibilities.
Every model will just give the range of possibilities.
What actually happens depends on the choices and the actions we take every single day.
That's why regardless of the model that is put out there, we can impact that model, we can change the predictions based on how we act.
Staying home, keeping two metres distance, and washing your hands.



**Reporter**:

Dr. Donnell referenced yesterday that they'll be able to make predictions on the data largely because of projections we've been able to put out numbers on the death rate.
Why can the federal government not put out projections on that right now?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, the same way in Canada, the way different provinces are experiencing, arehandling, are bringing in measures to adjust to their situations vary, as well.
and at the federal level, we depend on collating, collecting all that data from the provinces in order to build a better picture of what's going to happen across the country.
Before we can get to a proper national model, we need to have an even better idea of who we're doing in various provinces.


[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize that different provinces have different circumstances, just as we see around the world.
There are very different situations out there, depending on what they're experiencing.
That's why at the federal level, when it comes to developing an idea of what Canada is going to be facing across the country and developing projection, we have to use data and projections from across the provinces.
That's what we're doing right now.
We are collating that in the coming days, and will give it to you soon, what you should expect.



**Reporter**:

What is the number, what is the impact thattrump's order has on Canada's medical supplies?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

As we said, we have been working day and night to source medical supplies for Canadian front line workers.
We have shipments coming in in the next 24 hours.
We've received shipments over the past days.
We continue to work with suppliers around the world to ensure that we do get the medical equipment that we need, and we have more coming in regularly.
At the same time, we're working with the American administration to ensure that they understand that goods and services that are essential to both our countries flow in both directions across the border, and it is not in any of our interests to actually limit that flow.
We are also, of course, turning towards Canadian manufacturers as the tremendous effort that Canadian companies are putting in to manufacture made in Canada equipment and medical supplies that is going to actually not just supply Canada, but be there to supply other countries who need them as we meet our own needs.
This is part of what Canada is doing to ensure that we are protecting our front line workers and all Canadians every single day.


[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We will continue to work to bring essential goods in from around the world.
We will continue to work with the United States administration and point out to them that it is in the interests of both our countries to have the essential goods and services that we require on both sides of the border, and we will continue to work with industries across Canada to develop Canada made solutions to keep all our workers safe.



**Reporter**:

-- means you don'thave the numbers or does it mean you're not willing to share it? and given that the e. U. has done this several weeks ago, why hasn't Canada does the same?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

It is important to keep the supply chains flows.
We know that Canada is depending on the arrival of P.P.E. From around the world, and that's why we're facilitating those arrivals.
We've had some, and we're getting more in the coming days.
We're continuing to impress upon countries around the worldthat they're hurting themselveswhen they limit the flow of essential goods across our borders.
We need to work together to getthrough this global pandemic, and that is what we will alwaysdo.



**Reporter**:

Bryan Mullen, global news.
Are you concerned with the limited amount of testing means you don't have an accurate picture of what's going onto form policy, especially the role of asymptomatic people infecting others, which more testing would have identified?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Canada has been doing more testing.
We're ramping up. We're certainly doing more testing like other countries than the United States, and we're seeing that strong testing in places like Alberta and British Columbia have been very effective in managing and controlling the spread of COVID-19. We recognize that mass testing and accurate rapid results are a key part of managing the virus going forward, of ensuring that we continue to be safe through the coming months, and that's why we are increasing our testing capacity every single day.


[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We recognize that test kits are absolutely critical to manage the spread of the virus, and, of course, we are doing well in terms of extensive testing in Canada, but we can always do more, and that's one of the reasons why we are constantly increasing our testing capacity.
In British Columbia and in Alberta, for example, the testing kits have been very effective, and the testing in general has been very effective in controlling the spread of the virus.
We know we have to do more across the country, and that's why, every day, we are increasing our screening capacity.



**Reporter**:

Are you concerned that the battle that we're seeing over face masks such as the one we're seeing now with 3-m could extend to other supplies and medications to treat COVID-19? could this just be the tip of the iceberg, and what are you planning to do about it?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

That is one of the reasons why we have turned towards Canada's local industrial capacity to develop these solutions for the coming weeks.
We know that made in Canada solutions are on their way because thousands of businesses, of manufacturers across this country are stepping up, are switching their assembly lines and supply lines over to producing the necessary medical supplies and equipment that we need.
In the meantime, we will continue to source these products from suppliers around the world.
Shipments are coming in over the next 48 hours.
We've had shipments coming in over the past few days to ensure our front line workers are going to continue to get the help that they need.



**Reporter**:

But are you concerned that getting these products is in jeopardy?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

That's why we're so concerned about manufacturing these items so that we can provide our supply in the long-term, and we can be there four ourselves as we manage thespread -- for ourselves as we manage the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, we're managing to procure the supplies that our frontline menand women need right now.


[speaking french language]



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We know that there is global competition ought there in terms -- out there in terms of trying to secure masks, and that's why we are trying to develop our locating capacity to protect our front line workers.
This is a solution that will be in place in the medium term, and in the short-term, we will be receiving shipments of material from around the world which we need to keep our citizens safe.


[speaking french language]



**Reporter**:

Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke to Mr. Trump about that.
Would there -- do you think it would be a good idea to postpone it or do you want it implemented right away? and in terms of the masks, how can you negotiate with him on this?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, in NAFTA, there are people in the government working on this now, but of course, we have a lot on our plate right now in responding to COVID-19. But I can assure people that the new NAFTA agreement will come into force very soon.
NAFTA, the current NAFTA, in the meantime, remains in effect and will guarantee free trade with the United States, so we will be coordinating this effort with the United States and Mexico, by our priority right -- but our priority right now is to do everything we can do to protect Canadians from COVID-19. In terms of My conversations the president, I point -- of my conversations with the president, I pointed out that there are Canadians that work along the border and on whom they depend.
and there are also a great many products that are essential for the United States in fighting COVID-19, and I know that there will be a very constructive discussion, as we always have, and always have had.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

We will continue to work very, very hard to remind the Americans, as I will in My conversation with president trump when it happens in the coming days, that we are, both of us, interlinked in ways that means that it would hurt both of our countries in our ability to protect our citizens were supply chains to be disrupted.
There are Canadian health professionals right along the border with the United States who engage in supporting American medical systems on a daily basis, and that would be something that is valuable to the United States.
It's also extremely valuable that we are part of essential supply chains for parts like testing kits to gloves to materials for n95 masks.
We know we do better when we work together, and that'll be My message to the president.


[speaking french language]



**Reporter**:

Are you open to postponing the agreement?



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Well, we will look into that with the Mexicans and the Americans, and it will something that we will continue to work on, but our priority iscovid-19.



**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

As a reminder for everyone, the existing NAFTA is still very much in place and will remain in place as -- until such a time as the new one is brought in. The people who are working -- who usually work very, very hard on ratification of trade deals, like most people in government, are very much folk used on the response to co -- focused on the response to COVID-19, and that will be our response right now.



**Vassy**:

That's prime ministerjustin Trudeau in his daily address making some significantcomments.
I just want to begin by highlighting the salient comments in the announcement hemade, because it has to do with vulnerable Canadians in this province.
The announcement for the money came last week, but now, we find out where it's going to. $40 million for women's domestic violence and assault centres across the country, andthen, $10 million for indigenous shelters.
Now, the majority of the questions that the Prime Minister got centred on two issues.
The first being that order from president Donald trump, United States president Donald trump to 3-m to stop exporting, to stop sending crucial n95 masks to health care workers in this country.
Prime Minister saying that he'll be speaking to president trump in the coming days, and in that discussion, he would highlight the importance of the interdependence of the relationship between the United States and Canada.
The other issue that he got questions on cancer ed around releasing various -- centred around releasing various scenarios that are being presented around Canada, and the Prime Minister said that would come in the coming days.
I want to bring in Catherine Cullen, who was listening alongside myself to the comments.
Catherine, it sounds like they're waiting on just ontarioand Quebec.
They have the numbers from Ontario.
They're going to integrate them, and the numbers from Quebec will come next week, but it does sound like we'll get those scenarios sooner rather than later.



**Catherine**:

I noticed one of the questions the Prime Minister was asked about that, he said there are a range of models.
Some of them talk about weeks and months to much longer than that.
Obviously, implicit in that is the fact that they're already looking at models, and what the prime Minister seems to be saying is we want to give you abetter picture than what we've already been looking at. We want to give you a fuller picture of aligning the statistic information from one province to the next.
I think they measure in terms of the way that people are being tested to all aspects of this.
They're already looking at all information.
They're waiting until they achieve a certain bar before they bring it to all Canadians.
But then, that brings up a range of other questions.
What does that say about the economic measures that they have to put in place to try to keep the Canadian economy -- I'm not even sure that functioning is quite the right word, but in order to make sure that Canadians can pay their bills and put food on their table.
Certainly, also, questions about those -- the self-isolation measures that we're dealing with right now.
I think for most Canadians, that's the most pressing question.
Can you give us a sense of how long you're going to ask us to stay home? can you give us a sense of whenthe measures might loosen somewhat, so all the questions that the government is going to have to deal with when it puts this data forward? so I think it's going to continue to face questions about this until it does.



**Vassy**:

Okay.
I'll leave it there.
I want to swing over to Washington, where Katie Simpsons standing by. Katie, the Prime Minister got allot of questions on the president and the United States sending masks to Canada.
No word from the prime minister on the number of masks that Canada is missing out on. But the Prime Minister did say in the next 48 hours, that Canada will be receiving a transmission of millions of masks by chartered cargo flight.
I know that Quebec is in dire need, eight days until they run out of items for P.P.E. Katie, what are you hearing behind the scenes? the Prime Minister saying he's got a call with the president in the coming days.
Katie, what information do you have behind the scenes to get the president to try and changehis mind?



**Reporter**:

They're trying to lean on the key relationships that they established over the past four years to make Canada's case.
President trump was very blunt in his words yesterday, seeming that he didn't care that canadawas pushing back with this issue with 3-m, but two senior sources with direct knowledge of the situation, the president's chief of staff, Katie telford, is trying to lean in on the relationship she's developed with Jared kushner, who now has a key role on the coronavirus task force out of the white house.
That is a source of criticism down here because he does not have any experience in coronavirus, and he's already been criticized of the way the operations are going.
Jared kushner was told right away, get masks to new York city, and he got 200, 000 on the way right away.
There's been a lot of criticism about how official channels are not being used the way they should in an emergency.
However, some Canadians see thejared kushner placement on thiscoronavirus task force as something Canada can use to their advantage because Katie tel ford has used that to her advantage.
As negotiations became tense and as Canada kept trying to make its case, they could reach out to those individuals and really sort of lean in to try and really make a case.
That is the strategy that is being used here again, and two sources tell me that the kushner connection is something that the Canadians are going to try to rely on. I'm also told by a senior source in the administration, the key figures, the key contacts are Kirsten killman, and deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
They are the main channels of conversation at this point, but what I'm also told by this senior source is that because this is about the health and safety of Canadians, they're trying to employ all of the key relationships they developed during NAFTA negotiations, and that's the strategy they're going to try to use going forward.



**Vassy**:

Excellent.
I appreciate that, Katie.
The cbc's Katie Simpson from Washington.
I think we have a few minutes to get to drew dillkins.
We just heard the Prime Minister talk at length, get a lot of questions about this order from the president to stop sending masks to Canada.
You are the mayor of a city that is so intertwined with its sister city on the other side of the border.
We heard the Prime Minister speak about the number of nurses that live in Windsor and work in Detroit.
What can you tell us about how interdependent that relationship is?



Well, Vassy, My city, certainly, the 2, 000 to 3, 000 people who cross the border every day, health officials who live in Canada, cross the border every day to keep hospitals stateside going.
If there's some sort of further restriction that the president is inching towards --



**Vassy**:

I'm sorry.
I've just got to interrupt you.
We're just interrupting the main network.
You're watching CBC news network.
Thanks for joining us.



**Vassy**:

Hi there.
I'm Vassy kapelos in Ottawa.
We're standing by, waiting to here from federal authorities in this country on the update of coronavirus.
I just rudely cutoff mayor dillkins.
We just had to get off the main network and get back to CBC news network.
You were just telling me how you view this statement from president trump.



Yeah.
Without understating the situation, if the president is inching toward a harder stop on the movement of goods or people, I'm just telling you, there are 2, 000 to 3, 000 people that cross the border in My city to work in Detroit health care facilities.
If this situation becomes more difficult because of what I would classify an inhumane decision, you will have hospitals, entire hospitals in Detroit that have to close down, and that is not an understatement because of the number of people that live in Canada crossing over to work indetroit.



**Vassy**:

Have you heard from any other mayors about this?



Yeah.
I have spoken with mayor dugganin Detroit, and I've spoken to hospital administrators there.
We've spoken of the importance of the relationship between the United States and Canada, what the impact would be. If he actually puts a hard stop at the border and makes life more difficult, you could potentially have entire hospitals that close down.
The city of Detroit is a recorded hot spot for COVID-19 today.
There's a three-week shutdown, a stay in place ordered by the governor.
It is a hot spot for COVID-19 in the United States, and so the game that's being played is deadly and dangerous, and our Prime Minister, the comments that I just listened to, showing greatrestraint and leadership at a great point in time.



**Vassy**:

Yeah.
I just wanted to check in with what the Prime Minister said.
He said he would be speaking with the president in the coming days.
No specific timeline, but in the coming days.
and Katie Simpson says the one that worked in the NAFTA negotiations would be applied here.
What do you think of that issue?



The Prime Minister is being very diplomatic and very appropriate -- put in troops between Canada and the northern border in the United States.
Just a week ago, he was suggesting opening up the country by Easter to be back in business at a time when things were spiralling out of control in several states.
and now we're going to hoard --much like people are hoarding toilet paper, this stance plays much more deadly game.
It is frankly immoral and inhumane, and I'm glad to see the Prime Minister saying he's going to do what's right under the circumstances and make sure that we don't show and demonstrate that sort of behaviour that we're getting.



**Vassy**:

Okay.
I'm going to head over to Ottawa.
I see Dr. Tam at the podium.
Thank you for joining us.



Thank you.



**Vassy**:

All right.
Let's head over to Ottawa and Dr. Theresa tam.



I just want to point out that we must take this illness very seriously.
While the vast majority of deaths occurring in people in the older age groups, definitely, the vast majority of the age of over 70, we have had reports of younger adults in their 20s and 30s who have died as a result of COVID-19, and others seriously ill, hospitalized.
So I think that's a very key message that we all have to take to heart really seriously.
So we are continuing to test At high rate in Canada, with tests completed now for over 309, 000 people in Canada, so around 4% of people tested have been confirmed as positive, and95% confirmed as negative.
and every day, we are working with provinces and territories to increase laboratory capacity to make sure that we can maintain this level of testing and sensitivity in our testing systems to track COVID-19. Today, the public health agency in Canada has released a new COVID-19 dashboard, and you can find that on our website.
and of course, we have been releasing a lot of data and epidemiolodgic data.
Canadians can quickly learn how this situation is evolving and learn more about the situation.
So this is the first time that authorities of Canadian data has been integrated into interactive and customized dashboard.
I know that I speak for all chief medical officers across the country when I say that we are grateful for the health care workers working to stopping the spread of COVID-19. We are also thankful to all Canadians doing their part by changing their behaviour, observing social distancing, and meeting the challenge to flatten the curve.
The only way to get through this is together, so Canada, let's do all we can to stop the spread of COVID-19 together right now.
[speaking french language]



-- there are 12, 924 cases ofcovid-19. Obviously, most cases have to do with older people, but we have also seen younger people affected by COVID-19 in their 20s and their 30s, and that is why it is so important that allcanadians take this very seriously.
These represent infections fromprevious exposures and not whatis happening right now, so evenif you're not hearing of cases in your community, it doesn't mean that there is no risk of exposure.
We must all consider that therecould be community spread in our area, and keeping to our two-metre distance is the safest option.
We continue to test at a high rate in Canada with tests completed for over 309, 000 people in Canada.
Around 4% of these people have been confirmed as positive, and95% confirmed as negative.
Every day, we are working with provinces and territories to increase laboratory capacity tomake sure we maintain this level of sensitivity in tracking COVID-19 activity.
Today, the public health agencyof Canada released the COVID-19situational dashboard for Canada.
This dashboard aims to make thedata we have more accessible, so Canadians can quickly learn more about how the outbreak is evolving and search for specific information.
This is the first time authoritative information has been built into an interactive dashboard.
I know I speak for medical officers across the country whosay that we are grateful for all of those who work in publichealth, health care, and laboratories to find cases, trace contact, and interrupt transmission to slow the spreadof COVID-19. Likewise, our thanks go out to Canadians who are doing their part by changing behaviours, observing physical distancing, and disrupting plans to take onthis national challenge to plank the curve.
We must keep this momentum as we wait for the signals that tell us our efforts are working.
The only way to get through this is together.
Canada, let's do all we can to stop the spread of COVID-19 right now.
Thank you.



We'll now call the question period.
[speaking french language]



For questions in the room, please use the floor mic.
We'll start in the room.
Operator?



**Caller**:

Thank you.
Please press star-one if you have a question.
[speaking french language.



**Caller**:

There will be a brief pause while register ants register their questions.
The first question is from Teresa wright from the canadianpress.
Please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Good morning, Dr. Tam.
I'm wondering, you talked about ramping up testing across -- in the different provinces.
I'm wondering what kind of capacity we have to continue to ramp up the number of tests that are being done in terms of personnel trained to do this kind of work?



I think in the Canadian context, there's already a preexisting network of public health laboratory, hospital labs, and others.
So the way that we're looking at ramping up laboratory testing, there are many different streams.
First of all, the current sense that we're doing is a p. P.r. Test that detects the r. N.a., the genetic component of the virus itself, and what we're trying to do is set up and support difference provinces to set up what we call high group testing so you can do more samples faster, and different jurisdictions are actually doing that, as well.
and secondly, looking at what we call rapid tests.
That can be done not in high volume, but very useful if you were living in more remote areas where transportation to the nearest lab is more difficult.
So those are undergoing evaluation right now, and those tests can be easily trained in different clinics or even in the territories they're using some of these technologies already, and they already easy to use.
and so -- they're already easy to use, and so training would not be difficult in that respect.
Internationally, there are different lab alternatives being used, but we need to evaluate them to see if we can implement them.
But another aspect, of course which we will look at evaluating is, in the end, looking at antibodies in peoples' blood and immunity.
So all of this is actually ongoing, and I think, you know, all of these, in the last couple of days, Canada is one of the highest per ca pita testing countries in the world.
But we need to look at who we're testing, targeting the populations of people at the right time and the right level, as well.
I think that needs to be fine-tuned, depending on the epidemiology on the ground.
So we're doing everything we can to ramp up our capacity.



and a follow up?



**Reporter**:

Just yesterday on the projections that were released by Ontario, there's some fairly stark projections when looking at the number of deaths in that province.
How consistent are those numbers with projections that you have seen nationally?



So first of all, I think I would like people to focus on what's happening on the outbreak now, and we have the dashboard that describes the actually he -- actual epidemiology, and what's happening with the epidemiology right now.
The models, they describe a range of possibilities, and these possibilities are for planning purposes.
They're not actual crystal balls.
Depending on the math, they're functions, and so we use them as flexible tools.
We do work collaboratively together with all the modelers across the country to look at those range of possibilities.
But the bottom line is, though, that these possibilities are highly sensitive to our actions.
So as we said, any actions that we take now changes those range of possibilities considerably.
It is important for provinces to input their situation because of these actions that are happening right now, and the experiences are a bit different in different jurisdictions depending on the epidemiology.
So a lot of those ranges are highly sensitive actions, so that's why we're saying we need to act now and practice social distancing, self-isolation, hand hygiene and all of those measures.
Because the fate of all of those possibilities of scenarios are in our hands.



Thank you, doctor.
Operator, next question?



**Caller**:

Melanie maquie.
Thank you.



**Reporter**:

I was wondering, do you think it's a good idea to release these projections, these numbers? are you comfortable with the idea?



That's an extremely good question.
I think we all want to bring Canadians along to an understanding of how we're planning for different scenarios, but I think that it is our responsibility to ensure that the public actually understands what models are for and what it's all about.
So I think for any others that are looking at releasing some of these projections in the coming days, it is very important for us to explain these as well as we can so that people do not think that, you know, this is what's going to happen tomorrow? these are not the crystal balls, these are scenarios looking forward to planning purposes, and they need to be adjusted according to some of the real-time information that we have.
So I think it's a responsibility that I think we need to all take very seriously, those of us who are releasing that kind of data.



**Reporter**:

So just to follow up, is that more of a yes than a no? and as a real follow up, with regards to the United States putting a stop to the exporting masks -- the 3-m masks, how big of an impact does it have on our supply? to your knowledge, I don't know, were we counting on 50% of these masks, these shipments coming from the United States? is it 50%? 60%? 10%? just give us a ballpark figure, please.



Yeah.
Just to finish your first question, scenarios, that's what they are.
and I think it's reasonable to plan on worst case snare Joe's Joe's -- scenarios and look at where they take you.
But it's also reasonable to look at long-term and prepare for near term scenarios, as well.
So the range of looking at long-term to near term scenarios is a practical one, and it's a useful practice.
So in terms of the second question, I know that I'm probably not the best person tolook at all the moving parts and the logistics, but we can certainly get back to everyone.
But I think just to stress thatthe global supply of personal protective equipment is, you know, there's a lot of stress related to our system.
Everybody's looking at P.P.E., so we're pulling out all stops.
I think acquisition lines will change every day in a very dynamic manner.
So as to what proportion this particular shipment or source, that will, I am absolutely certain, changes in a very dynamic way.



Thank you.
One more question on the phone, and then, we'll take questions in the room.



**Caller**:

Thank you.
The next question is from Maria Walsh from the globe andmail.
Your line is now open.
Go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Hi. Thank you, Dr. Tam.
I'm wondering if you can say specifically if what we saw released from Ontario is representative of what the models show across Canada, and if it's in the wire on the low side or the high side?



I don't think it's an outlier, it's a range of scenarios.
So looking at different attack rates and different impacts, I think, is definitely a very reasonable approach.
We do input, of course, collectively the range of serious illnesses, for example, and deaths on a real-time basis, as well, but those parametres actually change quite a bit with time, so I think all modelers or jurisdictions releasing data right now know those would change.



**Reporter**:

and following up, on the United States ban on medical supplies and exported to Canada, what impact does that have on our already dwindling supplies?



I can't answer that specific question in terms of the United States piece because I think that is still being worked out, and I think I will leave that to our ministers.
But we are looking at multiple streams of supply as well as domestic over time, and that's a very dynamic situation.
But I think it's a collective decision to look at allocation, as well, and how we do that on a real-time basis.
Thank you.
Let's start in the room.
CTV.



Thank you.
Dr. Tam, we've asked you a number of questions about masks.
Why people touch their face more, why they're not effective if they don't fit right.
Yesterday, we heard from the c. D.c. and the United States isrecommending people wear masks when they go outside.
What's your opinion on that?



I remember your question a few days ago.
We're learning more about this virus that's only been with us since January, and we, like the United states is looking at the latest recommendations and specifications right now.
So as I said last time I was at this briefing, and certainly, we'll be looking at the guidance -- many different guidance, actually, not just whether people should be wearing masks in public.
From the public wearing of masks perspective, our key message is that we need to reserve medical masks for health care workers, and we just talked about the fact that, you know, some of this personal protective equipment is in scarce situation, and we need to prioritize people looking after the sick.
and then, I would say My next strong message is there are things that we need to look at that we continue to do, hand washing, hygiene, etc.
One of the other things that people should do is cover your cough and not spread things to others by practicing cough etiquette.
What we are looking at in terms of the new science is people are looking at it just before they get sick.
If that's the case, having some covering protects you -- well, really, it prevents you from transmitting your droplets to others.
So it's an additional barrier on top of all the other things that we're recommending.
So I think that what we're saying is that if people use coverings that are homemade and not the medical masks, then we would private information on how you do -- provided information on how you do that properly.



Follow up?



**Reporter**:

If I'm leaving this press after talking to you, should I fashion some mask, should I have something on My face to cover up?



Well, I think depending on the situation, as well, is whether you can do social distancing.
I think that's one thing you can evaluate.
For example, if you're in public transit, and you cannot practice the two metres, for example, then having that additional covering or covering up your cough is a good idea.
So if you can maintain that two-metre distance, then that is what you should do. I think having an additional cover, barrier between yourselfand others, that is an additional thing to do, but I think we are actually reviewingthe science right now, so we will have more recommendations in the coming days.



Thank you, doctor.
Ashley from CBC news.



**Reporter**:

What supplies, besides n95s, does Canada get from the United States that are actuallyneeded in this pandemic?



I'm going to have to get back to you on that.
I know a whole range of supplies, a whole range of medical equipment, and some laboratory supplies, so I'm not learned in the logistics on other supplies, so I'm going to have to get back on that to you.



**Reporter**:

If this executive order happens to impact worker sand medications coming across the border, could that affect Canada, and what's your position on this?



Well, one, there's no proven treatment for COVID-19, but we could have clinical sites, and I think to enable those trials is very important and getting supplies for that.
So it is definitely something that we are working on. But health Canada actually has a -- is monitoring the supplies of all essential medicines and drugs, as well, very closely, and so if there's any signs that certain medications are important for Canadians is impacted, then specific action swill be taken to look at how we can get that supply from the original source or from other sources.
[please stand by]



Currently we do not have those numbers.
Then perhaps I can reform latefethat.
We always need Poe and we need it now.
It's an ongoing issue.
We know we're dealing with global market.
There is a lot of competition in terms of obtaining this criticalequipment.
The federal government is working very closely with the provinces and obviously it's Good thing for Canada to get bulk orders.
and we also use a formula to distribute is allocate this equipment to the provinces, but that really is the way teamcanada works.



On the number of ICU beds we might need, do we know right no win Canada how many ICU are available and how many ICU we could raise the limit to and if that will be enough if we hi thigh peak?



So the province and territories are most in tune with the capacity of availability on any givenmoment, but what I would be able to tell you is that the number of cases, the serious cases that we have is far within the capacity of Canada to cope with the outbreak right now.
What you're seeing provinces doing with these projections is to plan for much worse casescenarios.
So they are planning for that and they have, essentially, canceled elective surgeries, etcetera, so there are beds available right now.
In some jurisdictions, there at capacity but it's a situation the provinces can address.
At the national level, we can only look at in crude ways the total number of ICU beds incanada and then I can look at the numbers in ICU and I know that Canada has a much bigger capacity for ICU beds than the number of cases right now, but that could change, which is why we want Canadians to do everything that we can to reduce the health impact and reduce the impact on our hospitals.



Maybe if you could add tothat, it's hypothetical in terms of the ICU beds and ventilators that we may need and I think nothing is cast in stone and what we're trying to say to allcanadians, you have to do yourpart.
If we're trying to flatten thecurve, it's not exceeding, in this case ICU capacity.
So given the transmission andpropagation, what we're saying is that, Ok. hypothetically, over time, there may be thousand people in a given area that might need ICU care and ventilators and there's difference if those 1, 000 people end up in the hospital, in the same week, as opposed to being spread out over several week sand months.
That's what we're talking about, slowing down the curve and in the worst or best case scenario, the thousand people will spread out and that's what we'relooking at and certain Dr. Tam and I are working with our counterparts and how best to increase the capacity so that we do have that surge capacity.
The fact that hospitals acrosscanada are delaying or stopping elective surgery and pulling in retired physicians to make surecanadians do have access to the care they need.
Thank you.



Let's go to the telephonenow.



Thank you.
(speaking french).



Yes, from press Canada.
Mr. Nyoo, are you saying you don't know the kind of maskswe'll be receiving and howthat's allocated? answer, as I said, we know that this is a very fluid situation.
Everyone, including the federal government and the provinces are all on the same page and we'redoing the best we can to obtain the masks we need.
We need medical masks and personal equipment.
We've seen what's happening in the United States and othercountries.
It's a global challenge andwe're doing the best we can.
Now, at the same time, we have said we're working closely with industry in Canada because at some point in time, not necessarily now, but perhaps few weeks or months, we where going to have the capacity to manufacture essential equipmenthere.
But for now, the situation is constantly changing and I can'tgive you exact numbers.
Followup --



Repeat in English saying, yes, we're working closely wit hour counterparts in the problems provinces and territories.
With personal equipment and 95masks is a live situation, it'sfluid and the global market is very competitive.
We know what other countries aredoing.
We've heard what's happening in the United States and we'redoing our best efforts, andthat's not just the federalgovernment, but it's working in concert with the province andterritories, to get the necessary equipment we need for our front-line healthcareworkers and that's prioritynumber one.
and we're pulling out all of thestops, as they say.
The other part, and this is notsomething that will happen todaybut in several weeks, months, isthat we're ramping up andlooking at our domesticcapacity.
Down the road, what we hope todo is have domestic capacity tomanufacture and make the type ofessential medical equipment herein Canada so that we don't have to, quote, rely on the globalmarket.
So that's something that we'relooking at in the long-term.
But for the moment, it'sdifficult to give you exactnumbers because the situation isso dynamic and fluid.
Thank you.



Thank you, Dr. Njoo.



Followup.



Thank you, so while we'rewaiting to be self-sufficient ina few weeks and months and givenwe can't necessarily depend onthe United States, whichcountries do you think we canrequest this equipment from? will we have to rely on china orare there other countries thatwill able to supply the materialwe need? answer, well, I don't think I'mnecessarily in a position tocomment on what's happening withthe United States.
The Prime Minister has said thatit's an ongoing issue.
It's not that the market isclosed.
The Prime Minister and all otherpremiers and leaders are havingvery productive conversationswith their counterparts in the United states in order to ensurethat the flow of goods andservices continues.
and continuesto cross the border with the United states in bothdirections.
Now at a technical level, as well as a political level, weare always ready to engage inconversations with countriesthroughout the world.
We're doing the best we can withall and any countries, potentially, any country thatmaybe be a potential source ofessential medical equipment forcanada.



Let's go back in the room.
McKenzie?



Either one of you can answerthis.
You mentioned, Dr. Tam, specifically, about religiousholidays.
and let's say My mother calls me up and asks to come to dinner, what advice would you give tocanadians right now for people wanting to gather in big groups? is Easter canceled? what's your advice?



I did communicate with religious leaders, as well, to gain supports to help maintain physical distancing while continuing the connections that you need, social connections.
So we are encouraging people to connect in a more virtual way.
I think that's one of the keyaspects.
But our recommendation is no nonessential gatherings and most provinces have very key recommendations on gathering sand anything less than five to15.
But again, even a small gathering is a matter of maintaining social distance for the hygienic practises.



On a personal note, yes, we are planning for Easter in myfamily.
My two boys are in Montreal, inquebec, and we have family on the other side of the river.
We're planning a virtual Easter.
We'll figure out a timing and set up a webcam and toast each other and celebrate virtually and that's My personalsituation.



Dr. Tam, on testing, I just want to clarify something this has been asked.
I went on the public website sand took a look at the people qualified to get a test right now if you're showing symptoms.
One group is missing is nonessential workers who have not traveled but showingsymptoms.
People showing symptoms but no previous history of travel, the response you've basically give nus is that the priority has given to travelers.
It's been two weeks since canadahas closed its borders and the number of travelers coming Backus limited.
Are you considering changing the guidelines with people who don'thave a travel history but are showing symptoms to be tested?



So the key recommendation for people with mild symptoms is to stay home and you can also use some of the apps that are on the different websites, certainly on the coronavirus.
Ca to determine if you should seek further attention from public health or from medical advice.
So hopefully that will help people decide whether they need to present or not for furthertesting.
and so your question is an important one in that if you looked at the rate of our labtesting, over 95% of the tests that we run are on people whodon't have the virus.
So we are testing a lot of people who actually don't have the virus and I think that'sactually very reasonable for communities that are trying to detect if they have community transmission or not.
and that can be done indifferent ways in terms of surveillance system.
But I still think if your objective is to detect if the virus is in your community and if there's any communitytransmission, it's still really important to test the people who are severely ill, hospitalized and then the people like healthcare workers and those various specific situations.
What we're asking all canadiansto do is to stay home.
So that test itself doesn'tchange that recommendation.
So I think that's the other way of looking at it. Will that test change what happens to you in terms of your health management? and right now, it would not.
So everyone who is even mildly sick should be staying at home and definitely distancing themselves from others.



I think we're running short on time.
Ashley, the last question.



Can I just finish one thing? I will be talking about some of our efforts and looking at the antibody tests in the comingdays.
Later on, if you want to detect the level of immunity in apopulation, because peoplehaven't been tested, they've all been staying home, that's different kind of study.
That's a layered approach to determine what exactly is happening with the outbreak in our communities.



Can you tell us a little bit about the stockpile of medicine we have? I know there isn't a treatment for COVID-19, but I know there'spain management being used.
Can you tell us about the stockpile and if we have enough in Canada right now to treatpeople?



So I think supply of medication is something that has to be monitored in real-time.
At the federal level, healthcanada coordinates and requestsmanufacturers to tell them ifthings are in short supply sothese are the regular systemsthat we have.
At the different levels ofgovernment and people who lookafter the health systems, and ithink at the federal level, wewould find everything we can to get those supplies in. There's many mechanisms from theregulatory perspective ingetting medicine and some ofthem may not be licensed incanada, but can be comingthrough emergency use.
At the federal level, I want to be very clear that our stockpileis a very, very specific onethat is targeted towards veryunusual pathogens like smallpoxand it is the provisionaljurisdictions that havemaintained those supplies ofregular medications and in ourpharmaceutical system.
So I just don't want people to get the wrong impression thatthe national emergency strategicstockpile is where the medicinesare, but we have a way ofmonitoring everything that thecanadians need and many otherdepartments can help in makingsure we have what we need.



You're in constant communication with the province sand territories and their medical officers of healththere.
Have any flagged to you they could be facing a shortage of these types of medicines?



I think that's a question that health Canada might be better to answer.
But so far, I think people are flagging medications and others where we have to keep a close eye on supply.
(speaking french).



Thank you, that ends the press conference.



We've been listening todr.
Theresa tam and Dr. Njoo, the health officials in thiscountry, focusing on a federalissue, the supply of personal protective equipment, essential medical supplies for healthcare workers in this country, the kind of stuff that they need to treat patients who are suffering from COVID-19. In particular, they focused onn95 masks, the masks that the healthcare workers wear, keeping out 95% of the particles that could contribute to the spread of the chiropractors.
Last night president trump, south of the border, issued an executive order that effectively trying to block the export of those masks from a company called 3m and they supply significant amount of masks.
We could not find out from that press conference and although the health officials and Prime Minister was asked how many masks exactly how many canadagets from 3m, how big of supply it is, compared to our other places that we source those masks.
However, we have heard politicians often use and those public health officials say Otis a significant portion of asupply.
We just don't have the exactnumber.
I want to get analysis right away on where this is all headed and for that I'm joined by sarahgoldfetter at the ernscliffcanada group and scottiegreenwood.
Good to see you both.



Hello.



Hi.



Sarah, you've been helping me behind the scenes understanding the genesis of what the president has ordered and can you help our viewers understand what the president is dictating right now in.



The defense protection act is an act that the president enacted awhile back to help domestic production of key items that would be needed in the response to this crisis and soit's a war-time piece oflegislation that was reallyconstructed to ensure that the United states had everything the United states needed in case ofa war, which is what this isbeing presented as, quitefrequently in the eveningbriefings by the white house.
He's called himself a war-timepresident and sees this as awar-time response, which is whyhe's using a no-holds barattempt to get all of the gearand all of the different piecesof equipment and medicines thatthe United States needs in orderto help its citizens.
It's not unheard of and not theonly country that's kind oftaken the same kind of steps.
The eu has done this, Au well, china has done this, as well.
Taiwan, japan, korea, they alldid similar actions to try topush back against the loss ofresources at the peak of theepidemic in their countries andthis is part of the attempt by the United States.
This requires all companies, companies operating in the United states, if they'reproducing items deemed criticalto this response, it requiresthem to fill federal ordersfirst.



Scottie, the federal message from the prime Minister di'm paraphrasing here, but Sarah's exactly right, all of the other countries are doing that.
I think the message they'retrying to send is Canada isn'tall those other country.
We heard mayor Wilkins go over the healthcare program, how effective might that message be when the Prime Minister is talking to the president, hesays, this the coming days?



Well, it has the benefit of being true.
So the economic interdependence and the lives of our countries are real intertwined.
There is a subsequent memorandum of understanding between canadaand the United States called thecanada-United States defense productionsharing agreement, in which itsays whatever we do, whateverthe response is, we shouldapproach it bilaterally.
and I think that's reallyappropriate here.
This crisis doesn't knowboundaries, or borders.
The solution will not knowbetween the United States andcanada.
Whenever the vaccine andtreatments come, it could easilybe a lab somewhere else in theworld and we have to havepatterns of working with eachother and we have to have trustbetween each other so that we can confront this together andvassy, you and I talked about the inputs from the papermillsand there are all sorts ofreasons we need to work togetheron this and not turn inward.



Let me ask you, Sarah, to to what degree do you think that message will resonate with thepresident? as you highlighted, every nigh the and other officials are coming out and conveying the idea that this is war-time.
The pressure on thatadministration to fulfill theneeds of states when it comes tosupply is immense right now.



Right.
and so while I think what scottybrings up is 100% correct.
It's really, really difficult to unscramble the egg here for the United states and Canada supplychains, especially as it pertains to some of this protective equipment.
The reality is that the United States has acted in the United States' best interests before in ways that it does not necessarily benefit Canada.
We can think most recently to the 232 terrorists and there have been things the president has done recently that show he'sviewing this differently, ithink, than necessarily a trade relationship or even the close bilateral relationship that the United states and Canada have.
For example, the overture he made to kiraback which is German company and there is precedent around the world when the Australian medical company created the vaccine for h1n1, their own laws made it so thatthe australian producers had tovaccinate australians first.
So I think there is a fear thatwhatever happens next in thispandemic, that countries thatcome to solutions first willtake care of their own peoplefirst and only then will lookoutside their borders.
We understand they arefacilitating a lot of companiesengaging in further domesticproduction of the ppe and theequipment that will be requiredhere and I think that's wise.
Because I think despite thebilateral relationship, canadaneeds to ensure that canadianswill be serviced and get all ofthe equipment they need.



Scotty, I have a minute left and I wanted to touch on what we also heard from the Prime Minister and from My colleague, Katy teleford, very significant adviser to the Prime Minister, will lean on her connections with Jared kushner.



Around the scenes, behind thescenes, everybody has to engage in every level and Canada'sambassador to the United States, ambassador hillman, knows a lot about how this will work and think that is incredibly good she is here.
But Katy reaching out to jaredkushner will come in handy, as well members of parliament and members of congress andgovernors, premiers.
All of these things need to be brought to bear in order to get through this and to remind the United states that even if we are in war-time footing, as wehave been in the past, that theanswer is at least from acanada-United States point of view toconfront the challenge togetherand I think that message willresonate.
I think it has to resonate.



Ok. I'll leave it there.
Thank you to both of you and wishing the best to both of you.
We want more information on those masks and while they'recrucial to healthcare worker sand we're joined by family physician Dr. Peter Lin who is in Toronto.
Good to see you again.
Help us to understand the difference between n95 masksand, for example, surgicalmasks.
These are the masks, the n95that the president is trying toblock Canada from getting rightnow.



So the n95 masks are fitted so they do a special test where they put a bag around the your head and they put in chemicals that you can smell.
That will stop 95% of the viral particles and very important for people close to the patients that have COVID-19 because there are a lot of viral particles sitting there.
For the normal surgical mask, those are leaky and helpful in other situations, but the n95 is crucial for people looking at patients that have COVID-19. Right now, we have about 500plus patients in hospital situations that will require that kind of a level ofprotection.



What about the supply of it? it's hard for us to ascertain because it depends on theprovince, how many of thosemasks, really, healthcare workers need? what do you hear from your colleagues about the potential for a shortage?



There is rationing already and that's already happened before any of this situation happened with the trumpadministration.
Because the hospitals were realizing that we can't afford all of the masks tossed away because most of the time in each situation when you go from one patient to another patient, you have to get rid of everything.
So that's why in the beginning, they said we need to keep these masks so that you get two per shift and they were limiting it only because they wanted to make sure there was enough supplies floating around.
But learning from Italy, what they keep telling everybody is to locate all of the COVID-19patients in one location.
What they did was they pushedeverybody into one hospital, eventually.
At first, it was all over theplace so you might have apatient here and a patient herewhich means that anybody thatgoes into that room has to gownand disgown and get rid ofeverything.
If you keep everybody together, then basically the doctors andnurses and all of the healthcarepersonnel can wear the samegown, the same mask is lookafter many people at the sametime.
Let's say there's ten people inone area, they can look afterall ten people and don't have tokeep changing things and we candecrease the number of personalequipment we go through.
So the italian experience is toclump everybody together so thatway you don't have to keepchanging your personalequipment.



Appreciate your expertise, asalways, Dr. Lin.
Thank you so much for joiningus.



Thank you.
