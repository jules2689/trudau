Program starting today.
If you've lost your job or income because of COVID-19, you can apply for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB.
We will tell you who can apply and when and how to do it. I know many of you have done it. We are expecting the Prime Minister to talk about some of the big banks who are cutting their interest rates after much pressure.
I know many of you had concerns about that.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will address Canadians, as he has every day, and we will bring you that when it begins followed by the briefing from the federalministers.
Let's bring in Vassy kapelos, host of "power & politics", and David Cochrane.
This is a day a lot of people are waiting for because it means help is on the way.
If you look at My Twitter account, many have applied for the CERB.
Anecdotally just from the Twitter sphere, it appears to be going well.



**Vassy**:

The application process itself, Rosie, seems to be hitch-free.
Going in that was a huge concernfor the system being overloaded.
The government insisted that this new stream was set up in order to combat some of those technical difficulties.
By and large anecdotely, it sounds as though the system is working.
That's not to say it encompasseseveryone who would be impacted by this program.
There are a lot of people -- I'll highlight students or certain self-employed people or freelancers who feel they are not able to access this program.
We'll hear something about that from the Prime Minister and alsoabout the wage subsidy that was announced last week.
I don't know what the answer is to filling the gaps, but the pressure is on the government tosort of, I guess, address the issue and try to figure out way s to mitigate the effects on those who don't qualify.
I'll highlight another issue I'mguessing there will be a lot of questions on, personal protective equipment.
We have been talking about this for days.
The export of those to Canada being blocked or limited was announced by president trump.
Premier doug ford announced thathe's seeing in Ontario the province is running out.
We know that there are big stumbling blocks due to the policy of the white house.
So I think there will be a lot of questions directed to the Prime Minister and how the federal government plans to address some of these huge issues.



**Rosemary**:

That's fair to say for sure.
On the side of your screen you will see some basic information about the CERB.
You'll see the government wants you to apply according to your date of birth.
If you do it anyway, it will go through.
They just don't want you to do it all at once because they want the system to hold up. We will talk to someone on that in a moment.
David, what are we expecting?



**David**:

Rosie, I don't think they wanted you to tell Canadians that.
The gaps in the system that Vassy mentioned, the system was built to get money out fast, but they know it wasn't perfect.
The roll out seems to be going well today.
If anyone has had a catastrophic jump because of COVID-19 but Nita 100% revenue drop, which is the standard for the CERB, that will need to be shown later.
As the Prime Minister said it's hard to roll out a program quickly and cover everyone.
They will see who this misses and then they can patch over those gaps in the system.
They are trying to make this as universal at possible.
They're just working in a ridiculous circumstance right now in terms of designing policy and they're going to take steps to catch people who have not been caught in this safety net.
We knew the portal would open and we know it's going okay.
Our colleague from Cynthia mulligan did an interview with Doug ford and he told her there was a shipment of 3 million masks stopped at the border.
Without those masks, the province could be out of personal protective equipment in the coming week.
I've been speaking to people at the federal procurement level.
Canada is now relying heavily on china because of this.
They need a couple of big shipments coming out of china to make everyone feeling better.
When you see people blaming china, including Donald trump, of what is going on here, there will be a reluctance at the federal government level.
When you are relying on that country for the front line medical gear you need, that doesn't help opinion.



**Rosemary**:

I have received tweets from people who have not lost all of their income and wondering what will happen to them.
The Prime Minister was asked about students again yesterday.
He said they're on the case and they'll have more to say in the weeks or days ahead.
The students trying to find work in the summer months are not going to find it now.
That is another big crack in the policy that the government is very aware of. Let's check in with someone who has already applied for the program today.
Marissa verdoni is a chiropractor who is at home with her two kids.



**Interview**:

Hi.



**Rosemary**:

You applied.
What was it like?



**Interview**:

It was super easy.
I wasn't sure how quickly I would get through.
It was 8:00 this morning.
I decided I was going to do My application online.
I logged in. I do have a C.R.A. Account.
I logged in online and there wasan error message.
I'm not sure whether that had something to do with My account or it's a busy day.
So I decided to call in. I did one phone call with a busysignal and then I called right back and got through.
There was a few questions.
They asked me for My s. I.n. and My birth year.
There was a recorded message saying what the CERB is, how youqualify, and making sure you metall the prerequisites to apply.
Once that was finished, I pusheda button.
and then they said you've qualified and you'll receive your direct deposit in three to five days.
That was all.



**Rosemary**:

That is pretty easy.
Let's see if you get it in the three to five days.
Tell me what has happened to your income since the beginning of all of this.



**Interview**:

Sure, I'm a chiropractor.
a self-employed sole proprietor.
I work at a couple of clinics.
My last work day was March 20. I went in for some acute care patients.
Our college has allowed us to treat acute care patients.
It's a grey zone.
Since then I have not worked.
My children have not been able to go to school or their daycare.
So I've been at home all day, every day taking care of them.



**Rosemary**:

That is a full-timejob.
I know all parents can relate tothat.
So the CERB, it sounds like you've qualified and you're going to get it in three to fivedays.
How does that make up for your income loss in terms of coveringyour expenses?



**Interview**:

It offsets some things.
I mean, obviously I would love to be at work, first of all, helping My patients.
Second of all, earning an income that meets the standard that we're used to. At least it's better than nothing.
I think I would speak for most people saying that I'm at home, I'm safe and healthy and so is My family.
Right now that is the most important thing for me. Any little help, we're going to do the best we can with it and save it.



**Rosemary**:

Your husband is obviously still working, so that helps your situation too?



**Interview**:

He is working.
It's funny because it does help knowing he's still getting an income, but it's also scary because he's going into work every day.
He's in manufacturing and been deemed an essential service.
They're going to be changing up their manufacturing lines and protocol and he's quite involved with that to make facemasks.
It's amazing.
But it's scary because he's going into work every day exposing himself.
The company has taken some precautions, but most people are going into work.
There's about 1, 500 employees.
Coming home and stripping down, having a shower, washing his hands, all those important things.
We don't know what's coming into the house every day.
That's scary, but mental health-wise it's good for him to be at work.
That's really hard.



**Rosemary**:

I'm sure it is. I get to leave the house and sometimes that does help.
So you've said this will help.
How long could you go do you think financially if you just had this coming in? no one really knows of course when this will end, but how long do you think you could go?



**Interview**:

Funny, I was speaking to someone who asked if this lasts for 18 months to two years, and to be honest I am not thinking about that.
I'm trying to take it a week at a time and do the best I can.
No one knows what's going to happen.
I don't see myself being off work for that long.
At this point we are able to see patients this way through teleconference.
Also, we are able to go into work for emergency and acute patients, as I mentioned.
The clinic I'm working for asked if I wanted to do that.
The challenging thing is exposing myself to anything, bu ti don't think I'll be able to go that long without seeing My parents.
In this profession you don't feel like yourself unless you'rehelping people.



**Rosemary**:

Could I ask, is there anything else the government could do for you if they're listening as we wait for the Prime Minister.
is there anything else that people like you could use in terms of support?



**Interview**:

Financially or just in general?



**Rosemary**:

Any way.
Anything you can think of.



**Interview**:

I think the government is doing the best -- I think the government is going a good job to be honest.
I think they're doing the best they can at this point.
Things are changing day-to-day and we have to remember that.
I am grateful to have the CERB benefit.
I think it's going to help.
It's going to help a lot of people.
In terms of me professionally, it would be nice if it was a little more clear what we are and are not able to do as essential workers.
But otherwise, we're all doing okay and it's just one day at a time.
There's no point in complaining at this point.
I feel fairly safe.
So I think we're doing okay.



**Rosemary**:

Okay is good enough for now.
I agree.
Marissa, thank you.
I'm glad it went well this morning.



**Interview**:

Thank you.
Have a great day.



**Rosemary**:

Marissa verdoni.



> good to put some places to this as people scramble to try to apply for the CERB to make up some income.
I'll bring back Vassy and David.
I'm surprised the phone worked in that case.
She couldn't get through online for whatever reason and she was able to call.
Maybe I'll put it up and maybe iwon't. We have the three screen captures of how easy it is. It is basically, if you get online, three clicks of your mouse.
That's sort of it. Ultimately, the government's goal is to get this money out the door as quickly as possible to as many as possible.



**Vassy**:

That's the idea, to capture a broad swath of the population.
They said what you would have to attest to. The bar is lower than e. I. that's the case.
There are just a few questions you have to say, yes, I have no income or low income.
Every month you're going to have to do the same to access that money.
But, Rosie, it is simple and straightforward.
I think from a technical application process point of view, this access program looks like it's working.
I would do what you highlighted earlier, just to keep in mind, and as we listen to the Prime Minister, figure out where the government is going for those people who don't fit into the program.
So people who have -- perhaps the biggest message I am getting, those who have lost the majority of their income, almost all of it, but not every penny.
They are struggling to find some kind of help from the government at this point.
I'm very, very keenly interested to find out -- like you said, the Prime Minister yesterday acknowledged there are gaps in this program and the wage subsidy program.
They are working on addressing those gaps.
I'm interested to find out how they're going to do that.
As we've been saying, for people who have lost the majority or all of their income, time is of the essence.
We're heading into April and another rent cheque and bill cycle.
I think they need that money.



**Rosemary**:

Here comes the Prime Minister of Canada.
