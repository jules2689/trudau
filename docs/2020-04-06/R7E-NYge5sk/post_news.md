**Rosemary**:

and that is the Prime Minister of Canada with his daily briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic on the same day that the CERB, the emergency relief benefit, is available to Canadians who have lost their work due to COVID-19. Lots of news there from the Prime Minister.
I'm going to start where we leftoff, if I can.
I'll bring in My colleagues, Vassy kapelos and David Cochrane.
This is following a report by "citytv" that we have not confirmed, but it was in an interview, that premier ford of the province of Ontario suggested he was going to run out of P.P.E., personal protective equipment, soon in the next week because a shipmenthad been held up at the border.
Vassy, the Prime Minister wouldn't say those words, but I understood him to be saying, yes, that is happening.
The furthest he would go is to say, yes, we expect those shipments to come.



**Vassy**:

Just to be specific about what the premier said, he identified one shipment from the United States that had been stopped over the weekend with 3 million masks.
What he said to "citytv" is that within a week personal protective equipment would run out for front line workers in Ontario.
Given the number of cases there and the spread of this virus, that's a hugely significant thing to say.
The Prime Minister was asked multiple times, do you know that to be the case, especially the last question there from one of our colleagues at CTV.
He would not acknowledge that that shipment had been stopped.
He was not specific about the United States.
He said he understood that to Bethe case with shipments from around the world.
There are delays.
Some of them have been stopped.
He would not specifically say, for example, those 3 million masks were held up at the border.
However, he did say that discussions were ongoing with people in the United States, in the administration.
He identified one specific conversation this morning between foreign affairs ministerfran√áois-philippe champagne as well as secretary mike pompeo.
and then he kept saying exactly what you identified there, rosie, we expect those shipmentsto arrive.
That's the most we can get out of that.
There are still a huge number ofquestions around have other shipments been blocked? is this the only one? I'm still not clear obviously the number of n95 masks we get from the United States is significant.
I don't know if it's half of themasks Canada gets or three-quarters.
How detrimental is it going to be to the supply in various provinces if there are no shipments coming from the United States anymore and what has happened in those conversations.
I know My colleagues have asked for a read-out of the call between Minister champagne and secretary pompeo, to see if there is any propensity to move on the issue.
The Prime Minister didn't necessarily address whether or not that's going to change any time soon, but he did attempt atleast to sound optimistic that it could be.



**Rosemary**:

Yeah, he did.
He also was so careful, as you've spelled out very well there, Vassy, in his language around this.
Obviously getting into a blame game or a reprimanding publicly of the United States for stopping a shipment, I'm not sure how that would go over.
It also sounds like this is the case and the message is that this has to stop.
I'm curious who stopped the shipment.
Was it border control that stopped the shipment? were they directed not to go further.
There are lots of questions around that.
David, I'll let you weigh in.



**David**:

It seems what you're seeing is a dusting off of the NAFTA negotiation strategy in terms of his comments.
No matter how specific the questions are, he is repeating stock message, we are working with the United States on this.
Raw materials are important and essential services and workers flow both ways across the border.
It is the best way to resolve this.
He is not taking the bait in saying anything that could enrage Donald trump.
We saw that through NAFTA and the motto in the Prime Minister's office at the time was we don't respond to words, we only respond to actions.
Now we have actions that happened at a material time.
Because the stakes on this are literally life and death for some people, a lot of reticence.
To say something explicit in public that might sound tough and make people feel good, but in the long run do a lot of damage.
It's busy work behind the scenes to open up the American border to these medical supplies, while also working furiously in china or Brazil where they may make masks to get alternate supplies.
Relying on the United States for everything exposes you to a lot of vulnerability, especially with the current mindset of the current administration.
They have to seek as many avenues as they can.
The other bit of news, the CERB application process rolled out at 6:00 a. M. today.
Nearly a quarter of a million people have been able to enroll.
It's a good sign that the system is holding as the rest of the country wakes up. More strain could be put on the system.
While the $2, 000 a month that we know is coming starts to roll out, a promise there from the Prime Minister to broaden the criteria of this to help people who have had their hours drastically reduced but are still working.
and also finding a way to keep people financially whole if they work in a long-term care home but they make less than if they would go off work and get the CERB.
Also a recognition that the wagesubsidy as currently designed also isn't broad enough and they're working on that.
The quote was, whatever your situation, we are working to getyou the help you need.
These programs won't be fully universal.
People like us are still workingand getting salary, but they aregoing to expand the criteria to solve the gaps.



**Rosemary**:

Vassy, I'll get you to weigh in on the gaps.



**Vassy**:

Yeah, those are the gaps that have been identified to us by so many Canadians writing in, especially I would highlight those people who have seen their income drastically reduced but not fully eliminated.
The Prime Minister indicated, asdavid said, that there was additional help or they would specifically be addressed "in the coming days." we don't know how that is going to roll out or if they can avail themselves of the entire CERB.
He was specific in his language saying if you're working 10 hours or less making $500, he had specific terminology and also those working in care homes who would be making more if they went on the CERB as opposed to working.
He seemed to have a subset of people the government is attempting to cover I guess with the second wave of CERB.
But we really don't have the details to what degree they will be covered and just how it's working in the coming days.



**Rosemary**:

I'll be back to you both shortly.
Thanks for that.
Another bit of news to expect atnoon.
The Prime Minister hinting that Dr. Tam, Canada's chief public health officer has "new reflections about wearing masks in this country." we'll of course have that for you at the top of the clock.
As we've been talking about thisbenefit, the CERB doesn't cover everyone, including My next guest, Abigail gelsand, joining me from Toronto.



**Interview**:

Hi. Thanks for having me.



**Rosemary**:

Tell me why you don't think you'll be caught up with the Canada emergency response benefit.



**Interview**:

My husband and I run a small community arts program, house of combat.
We are on greatly reduced schedules.
Our facility has been closed since March 14. We have been able to move some of the classes online, but certainly not all.
We have amazing support from thecommunity, but we have members who have requested refunds or a credit.
It's hitting everyone across theboard, including our members, so we understand that.
Not everyone is able to do the online training or benefit in the same way.
In that position, we're looking at a much reduced income.
and we have the massive overhead costs of sustaining the facility while closed.



**Rosemary**:

a couple of questions.
The Prime Minister just suggested there that people who are working less than 10 hours a week or getting $500 a month, they would get support.
Would you fall into that category?



**Interview**:

For less than 10 hours a week, just about.
For less than $500, just about.
Because we're a small business and things vary week to week and month to month, it's hard to say.



**Rosemary**:

Do you have other employees? would the wage subsidy program that is yet to be in place, would that be of help?



**Interview**:

Not truly.
Our employees are handled as contractors.
There are students we pay to assist with the classes only when classes are running in the facility.
So it would not be relevant.



**Rosemary**:

There is also small business loans they've made available.
You've got a place where this happens and you have to keep it up in running.
Have you thought of using that and is that a possibility?



**Interview**:

Keeping that open is important to us. We've been around for 10 years in this capacity.
We have two young children and aren't to pay for our department.
Debt is just not something that makes sense for us right now, but we would be open to it because we want to sustain what we've built.



**Rosemary**:

What are you going to do? how long can you go on without much coming in and without some sort of solution? it sounds like there might almost be a solution for you, but not quite.



**Interview**:

Correct.
So, we have like a plan b and that really involves shutting down our actual facility and kind of working at other people's locations, kind of a private training modality.
It would be heart-breaking and we wouldn't be able to serve as many people as we do. It would hopefully when this is over provide some sort of support for our family which hasto be the priority right now.



**Rosemary**:

I only have 30 seconds.
How stressed and anxious are you dealing with this on a day-to-day basis?



**Interview**:

Anxious.
Trying not to be. I have two young kids under 3. We're just trying to hang in there and not worry about what'snot here yet.



**Rosemary**:

Okay.
You own the house of combat martial arts facility in Toronto.
Thank you so much.
I'm hoping for the best for you.



**Interview**:

Thank you for showcasing us.



**Rosemary**:

All right.
As we wait for our briefing from federal officials at the top of the hour, just a reminder that we are expecting some news from Dr. Theresa tam on the wearing of masks in this country.
We'll leave you hear on CBC television.
You can continue watching on CBC News network and CBC News.
Ca. [ please stand by ] whichnow shows a higher degree ofasymptomatic transmission.
That seeps to underpin thechange in recommendation southof the border and Dr. Chanhinted that her position haschanged over the past few day toacknowledge that.
It is a major difference fromwhere we started a month ago inthe spread of this virus and theadvice that was being handedout.
I would point to the sciencebehind asymptomatic transmissionchanged a lot.



That's right.
and lots of things have changed quickly over how public health advice and how different officials issue that advice and why they are doing that.
It will be interesting as well.
The advice from this CDC in the United states is if you want todo this, do this.
So and the other bit of information that the doctor talked about is what cannot happen is Canadians walk around with medical masks because that is obviously why we are hearing these stories about such desperate need for ppe, Canadians cannot be wearing surgical masks on the secrete because that doesn't make sense when healthcare workers need to are having pressure to expand their mask orders.
They have had a lot of success in flattening their curve and keeping their death rate lower than other country.
What they have in common isn'tmasks.
It's widespread testing and tracing of people.
and that allowed them to get ahead of the spread in a lot of ways by knowing who has it, who they talked to, where they are and taking the measures to keep keep inside and isolate them from other people and give them the support they need, medical, mental and financial so they are not spreading it throughout their communities.
So while there appears to be growing consensus that usingnon-surgical masks in publicwill help, there is a certaintythat testing, tracing, physicaldistancing and isolationabsolutely work.
So I think there has been areluctant ongoing all in onpeople wearing masks in public, because this false sense ofsecurity.
They don't want people to thinksimply because you have a maskit protects you beyond somethingwhat washes your hands would doin terms of keeping the germaway from you.
So this has been a challengingone.
I know people are reallytruthers on this and arguingthat Canada has lagged on this.
But it's not just this country.
It's a lot of countries that areslow to come to this, even onesthat have been extremelysuccessful, such as germany, which is they are far betterthan countries that it sharesborders with or close borderswith like france, for example.
Even a lot of economic andtravel ties to italy evenwithout the border.



Another concern is that somehow the idea of wearing am ask would make you less likely to do the other things that public health officials say are in fact more important, physical distancing and washing yourhands.
The CDC says use a cloth mask if you want to. This is just, it is not adirective.
So some sort of homemade mask that you would make.
and still practice physicaldistancing, but if you are going to be in a place where that is not possible or it becomes more challenging like a grocerystore, like I don't know department elevator, then those are the places to wear them.
But otherwise you still have todo these other things.



a point quickly, the mask is not to stop you from gettingsick.
It could be helpful with that.
It's to stop you from spreading your droplets everywhere if you are infecting other people.
My mask protects you, your mask protects me. and that has been a consistent public health message in canadafrom day one.
If you are symptomatic, wear am ask so you don't make peoplesick.



We have a statement from premier Doug ford about this stopping of protectiveequipment.
He says that indeed, delays in global shipmenments left the province with a one week supply of medical equipment.
We'll talk more about that after this briefing.



So important, unless of course you are doing essential work like stocking grocery shelves or you're on the front lines of our healthcare system.
and if you are doing that essential work, thank you verymuch.
I know that many Canadians today are struggling to make endsmeet.
That's why I'm glad to be able to say that applications for thecanada emergency response benefit are now open.
To make sure the system works, we are staggering the dayscanadians can apply based on their birth month.
We Canadians are resilient.
We are survivors.
I know we will get through thistogether.




**THE INTERPRETER**:

Canadians must continue to practice physical distancing.
Stay strong and stay at home, unless you are doing essential work such as filling grocery store shelves or providinghealthcare.
I know that Canadians are suffering right now.
and that is why I'm happy to announce that Canadians can now apply for the Canada emergency response benefit to ensure that the testimony works properly, we are staggering the days for application based on your birthmonth.
Canadians are resilient.
We are going to get through this crisis together.



Today we are going to hear from Canada's chief public health officer and the deputy chief public health officer.
 interpret as well as the president of thepressurey board.



Minister of health is here and able to answer yourquestions.
Thank you.
Doctor, please.



Hello, everyone.
As usual, I have an update on the numbers of COVID-19 cases.
There are now 15, 822 cases with293 deaths.
Most concerning are new outbreaks in hospitals andlong-term care facilities whichare in several provinces.
As well we are hearing of youngpeople being hospital eyed due to COVID-19 and people as youngas 20s dying of this disease.
This is a serious health dretthreat to everyone.
Although all their ages are mostat risk, no one can predict whencritical illness will strikesomeone at any age.
On the lab front, over 339, 000people in Canada have beentested to date with about fivepercent confirmed.
and we are continuing to test ata high rate to traffic wherespread is occurring.
In good news, British Columbia recorded alower number of cases this weekcompared to last.
While it is still too early totell, this continues toencourage us about collectiveaction can slow the spread ofthis pandemic.
Though there is cause ofcautious optimism, we must notrelax any of our efforts frompracticing physical distancing, frequent hand washing andcovering coughs to protect ourmost vulnerable.
As I noted yesterday, ourcollective scientific knowledgeof COVID-19 continues to grow.
Now that more countries have hadlarger number of cases and haveanalyzed transmission patterns, it is clear that transmission ofthe virus is happening moreoften than previously recognizedfrom infected people rightbefore they develop symptoms.
This is caused pre-symptomatictransmission.
There is also evidence that someinfected people who neverdevelop symptoms are also ableto transmit the virus.
This is called asymptomatictransmission.
We still don't know how big arole pre-symptomatic andasymptomatic transmission playin driving this pandemic, but weknow that it is occurring.
With this emerging information, these special advisory committeeon COVID-19 has come to aconsensus that's wearing anonmedical mask even if you haveno symptoms is an additionalmeasure that you can take toprotect others around you.
In situations where physicaldistancing is difficult tomaintain, such as in publictransit, or maybe at the grocerystore, a non-medical mask canreduce the chance of yourrespiratory droplets coming intocontact with others or land onsurfaces.
So wearing a non-medical mask inthe community has not beenproven to protect the personwearing it. It is an additional way that youcan protect others.
Wearing a non-medical mask inthe community doesn't mean youcan back off the public healthmeasures that we know work toprotect you.
So you must continue to practicephysical distancing and goodhygiene like frequent handwashing and regularly --high-touch surfaces.
It's important we keep thesupply of medical masks where itis needed.
Healthcare workers need medicalmasks.
We are still in a very criticalstage of Canada's COVID-19epidemic, and this is no time torelax our preventive measures.
As Canadians we may notoutwardly demonstrate our "pride& prejudice" but our hearts arefull of it and we are determinedpeople.
When someone says flatten the --we nay not outwardly demonstrateour pride, but our hearts arefull of it and we are determinedpeople.



Thank you.

As Canadians, we may notoutwardly demonstrate our pride, but our hearts are full of it, and we are determined people.
When someone says flatten thecurve, we say we'll plank it. We are stronger together, and we will get through this together.
Things will go well.
Thank you.




**THE INTERPRETER**:

Now I give the floor to the president of the treasury board [speakingfrench]



**THE INTERPRETER**:

Goodafternoon, everyone.
Prime Minister Trudeau made three important announcements this morning.
There's good news economically because the government is going to be supporting all these families who need this support given the difficult situation we are experiencing.
The first important news is the launch of the site where you can apply for the CERB, the Canada emergency response benefits.
300, 000 people have already applied successfully through the site this morning.
The site is working well.
It is solid.
and we are going to continue to work very hard in this respect and it's one of the reasons why the site is working well is because Canadians aredisciplined, and they areapplying, depending on when they were born.
Today people who can apply are those who were born in January, February or March.
The second piece of good news with respect to government support for Canadians, is that the 2.5 million requests for eithat were done in recent weeks were processed quickly.
2.5 million requests in just few weeks is more than whatcanadian government generally receives over a year.
Out of these 2.5 millionrequests, 2.1 of them we reprocessed over the past twoweeks.
So in two weeks, they received almost the same number of requests for EU as what was done in a year.
So as a reminder those who already applied for employment insurance do not need to apply for the CERB because their requests for EU are automatically transferred tocerb request.
The last piece of good news is we all have a role to play in health measures and economically as well.
The bank system and credit unions also have a very important role to play.
We are happy to learn thatthey've sizable reduced interest rates on credit cards, and we expect the banking sector to continue to ensure that allcanadians can do their share.
We are all going to get through this crisis together.
and we are happy, therefore, to have the cooperation of all economic players.
Thank you very much.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Now we are ready to answer your questions.
As usual, three questions from the phone and then questions from the medical questions.



Please press star one if you have a question.
The first question is from.



Good afternoon.
I would like to know.
We recognize that the cerbdoesn't meet the needs of thousands of Canadians because they have lost revenue.
But what will you do for workers who will be affected -- will the payments be retroactive? with respect to adjustments to the wage subsidy for companies, they are facing too manyobstacles.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Thank you very much for your question.
As we know, this is an emergency situation that requires emergency measures.
and that is why for several weeks now, we have done what is ordinarily done in months oryears.
We've been able to meet essential needs and urgent needs with respect to support for our workers and companies.
The CERB as the prime minister said this morning, we know it covers many people, many workers who need it. and it includes workers who normally wouldn't be eligible for benefits when they are unemployed or they lose revenue.
This means all workers who are normally not eligible for ei, freelancers or people whoweren't able to accumulate enough hours if they don't have any revenues for reasons that are not related to their jobsituation.
But nevertheless, there are still holes in the coverage of the CERB, and that is why the prime Minister Trudeau said this morning there were threecategoryies of people for which we are looking at in greaterdetail.
The Minister and the Minister of finance Minister are looking atthis.
There are three particular categories that are being examined right now.
People who have lost, forexample, a lot of hours of work but not all their hours of work.
and they haven't lost all theirincome.
We are talking about people who may not be earning as much as the $2, 000 that the CERB offer sand also students.
In some cases, they will behaving a hard time finding a job in the coming weeks and months.
With respect to students inparticular, I would like to remind you what's already in place now to help them.
Firstly, there is a six-monthmoratorium on the repayment ofstudent loans that they couldhave had in recent months andyears.
So they won't have to be makingpayments over the next sixmonths.
and interest that would haveaccumulated over this period hasbeen canceled.
Secondly, the Canada emergencyresponse benefit is alreadyhelping many students as they'velearned $5, 000 in income overthe year, they may have losttheir job in the service sectoror they might have lost theirjob at the university.
So these students are eligibleright now to receive the CERB.
and the being that we havealready done, which is veryimportant for students, is awage subsidy of 75%. this will lead employers to hireand rehire workers, includingstudents, who otherwise wouldhave been jobless and withoutincome.
With respect to the wage subsidyitself as we know, it is veryimportant.
and Minister is working veryhard to flesh out all thedetails.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

If I could just add something in french and perhaps you could repeat that inenglish.
With respect to people who are working ten hours a week orless, this obviously includes volunteer firefighters who are in a very important category for many Canadian towns, and we have discussed this situation in great detail.
Members did bring this questionforward, and we are going to solve this very key issue.



So thank you all.
Briefly in English.
So what is currently happening is that the federal government is reacting in emergencysituation, and in emergencymanner, which we haven't seen in the history of the social ofcanada.
That means we are putting into place things like the canadaemergency response benefit.
Things that would normally take months if not years toimplement.
We are doing this because we know that what already exists is helping millions of Canadians, and we are seeing the impact ofthat, more than 300, 000applicants already having successfully deposited their request for a CERB.
Now, we know as prime ministertrudeau said a moment ago that there is more to do. and there are three categories of people that prime ministerjustin Trudeau focused on moment ago.
First, those that have reduced hours of work but have not lo stall their income or all their hours of work.
So we are mindful of that.
Also those that would be receiving less in income than the $2, 000 per month of thecanada emergency responsebenefit.
and those like students that would have a hard time finding Job at the moment in the year at which they would normally be trying to find a job to pay for their expenses.
Now, the good news about the students that although there will be more to come, they have already done many important things for them.
First is the delay for at least six months of their payment for their student loans.
So the capital payments can be brought forward by at least sixmonths.
and all the interest that would normally accrue on their loan swill not be payable at all.
So there will be no interestpaid, not only in the next six months but that interest that would normally be paid in the next six months will not be asked for afterwards.
The second thing is the canadaemergency response benefit is already helping thousands of students right now.
Because there are thousands and probably hundreds of thousands of students that have earned more than $5, 000 in the lastyear.
But that have lost their job, sometimes their part-time job inthe restaurants or in a shop orat university as a assistant totheir teacher.
So there will be students thathave lost their jobs that haveearned enough income last yearand that are ineligible toasking for the Canada emergencyresponse benefit right now thisweek starting today and the restof the work.
Week.
and finally the wage subsidies.
They are very financial.
They will encourage and supportbusinesses towards eitherrehiring or hiring students thatwould have otherwise lost theirjobs.
So this we expect would be veryimportant for the students inthe next weeks.
In addition to things the Prime Minister said we would announceshortly.



Thank you, Minister.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Thank you.
With respect to the arrival of masks from the United States, that were meant to arrive in Ontario, but premier ford said that this shipment was banned.
What about that? and what about the national stockpile right now?



I discussed this with premier ford 15 minutes ago before this press conference.
We are very committed to working with all the provinces.
We are working hard with the United States administration to ensure that all the masks that we'vepurchased will be exported tocanada.
and we did have positiveconversations, and we continue to work to solve this situation, which is so vital to ourcountry, with respect to the situation with health services in general.
All provinces are working veryhard, as is the federalgovernment, of course the situation in Ontario is one that we know very well.
There's very good communication with the provinces, withontario, with the premier.
and we are going to continue to work very hard to ensure that people who are doing essential work to protect us at our hospitals do have the necessary equipment that they need.



Sure.
So we are very aware of the situation that ontarioexperienced with some masks it had purchased in the United States and having some trouble getting them across the border.
I spoke about that with premier ford just a few minutes before this press conference.
and immediately called ambassador hill man who is now very seized of the issue also.
More broadly, we have been working throughout the weekendvery, very hard with ouramerican neighbors to ensure that medical supplies can continue to flow across thecanada/United States border.
and let me emphasize, as weemphasized in our conversationswith our american neighbors, that that flow is a two-waystreet.
The relationship when it comesto medical supplies, when itcomes to healthcare betweencanada and the United States is, like all aspects of our economicrelationship, very balanced, very reciprocal.
and that is why a win/winoutcome, where both partiescontinue to help each other, isthe very best outcome.
That is the point we have beenmaking.
and we had some positiveconversations over the weekend.
and we are going to continue to have those conversations.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Next question.



Thank you.
The next question is from alexfrom the Toronto star.
Please go ahead.



Hi. Just to expand on that, premier ford put out a statement this morning saying that Canada is working to try to get an exemption from the United States order on preventing the export of ppe.
I'm wondering if you can confirm that and expand on extraexactlythese productive talk -- on what exactly these productive talks you are having with theamericans.



Exactly that.
We believe that the flow of medical equipment through the supply chain between Canada and the United States needs to continue unimpeded.
and that, of course, is atwo-way street.
Both countries benefit fromthis, and both countries wouldlose out if hurdles were to beput in the way of that flow ofhealthcare support between ourtwo countries.
We made that point in repeatedconversations over the weekendand today.
As the Prime Minister said, wefeel we are being heard, and welook forward to a definitiveresolution of this situation.
It's in the interest of bothcountries to continue supportingeach other when it comes tohealthcare.



Let me just add.
I also spoke to the global ceoof 3m, mike rowman, who has been doing a great job.
The company is taking a very, very responsible position.
They understand the very special place they are in right now.
and I would really like to commend the company for its approach and for its very constructive relationship withcanada.



The Prime Minister mentioned shipments from other countries have been delay, and there'sbeen stuff missing from shipments that have arrived.
Do you have any more details on which countries had shipped things that were delayed and exactly how much stuff has been missing from the shipments that have arrived in the recent days.



As patty pointed out at one of these press conferences lastweek, it is really a wild west when it comes to buying medical supplies right now.
This is a global pandemic.
and every country in the world is doing its best in a truly fierce competition to get medical equipment.
Canada, working very closely with all of our provinces, is working really, really hard in the international marketplace to get all the supplies we need.
It's hard.
But that's why we have to work even harder.
and it is also why I am so grateful to all of the canadianmanufacturers right across the country who are stepping up to figure out ways that we can make the medical equipment the testing equipment that we need here in Canada.
So it's a two-pronged approach.
We are working hard.
But it is absolutely very, verytough right now.



Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.
Operator, next question, please.



Thank you.



**THE INTERPRETER**:

Next question from Marie.



Good morning.
I would like to continue infrench.
Can you confirm that your government is seeking an exemption from the United States order that ceases the export of ppe? and you also said can you tell us when you expect an answer in this respect from the United States or how much time you're willing towait?







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Yes, I can confirm that Canada's position is that we must continue with the United States to have a flow of medical equipment, which we'vehad until now.
I would like to highlight forcanadians what the canadiangovernment highlighted in their conversations with the United States counterparts.
and that is this is a two-waystreet.
Canada exports a lot of medicalequipment, and we also havehealthcare professionals that dowork in the United States it's good for americans, at thesame time, the United States exportsmedical equipment that isnecessary for us. We need to have -- continue to have this situation, which is inthe interest of our twocountries, it's a win/winsituation that we have rightnow.
and that is what we want tokeep.
We've had many conversationsover the weekend.
and we've had them today as wellon this issue.
and these were positiveconversations.
and we do hope that it will bequickly possible to definitivelysolve this situation.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

All right.
In terms of 3m, since you had meeting with them this weekend, did you -- assurances? because it seemed reticent to export masks to Canada.
Did you obtain any assurances that 3m, that they will receive orders that we made?







**THE INTERPRETER**:

I don'tagree with what you're saying in the question.
It's not up to a company to ignore their country's laws.
It's up to a country to solve its issues in this respect.
As for 3m, we had a constructiveconversation.
3m's approach, while appreciate it greatly, they have been very responsible, and we discussed what 3m needed from the United States administration to continue to export its masks tocanada.
We also had discussions with 3mabout a central point, and that is there are mutual dependency.
We have our two countries depend on each other.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Thank you, deputy Prime Minister.



Ms. Freeland, you were saying you spoke to Doug ford 15minutes before you came here.
He talked about some masks and trouble at the border.
So how many masks, where were they coming from, what was the trouble and exactly how are you going to resolve it?



I'm going to let premier ford talk about this specifics of this particular province ofontario purchase, as he chooses.
We did speak about the fact that some masks that the province had purchased in the united states were having some difficulties in being shipped across the border.
and I pledged to the premier that the federal government would do everything we can to get those masks into Canada.
and we will.



All right.
I have other questions for you but unfortunately I have to mo veto masks.
About the cloth masks that you say is probably beneficial forcanadians to wear right now, why would it have taken so long, considering we know how infectious this virus is, and we know that people can carry it and not know it. So a mask, how could that havehurt? why didn't you see weeks ago wear a cloth mask?



So the evidence is actually still quite weak.
What the evidence that came to light in I would say the last ten days actually came from few studies about asymptomatic and presymptomatic illnesses.
So I think as I was trying to explain yesterday, there'sseveral different types ofstudies.
and they were published a number of them, in the last littlewhile.
So they are very specific studies in long-term carefacility, the diamond princesscruise ship and a hospitalsetting, for example, and astudy from singapore.
and that last one was releasedon April 1. So we have to take the evolutionof the evidence as rapidly aspossible.
and so the viral load studyshowed that, yes, people who arejust before they developsymptoms have high viral loads.
and so that tells us that thepossibility is there that theycan transmit.
We still don't know exactly howimportant transmission from thepresymptomatic or asymptomaticpeople are in driving thisepidemic.
There are other epidemiologicalstudies as well, for example, inthe seattle long-term carefacility.
So these are very recent studiesthat have just come out on thisparticular virus.
So we very rapidly tried tointegrate that slate of science.
On the issue or the area ofwearing masks to protect others, which is the -- what we aretalking about, is non-medicalmasks, which may be made ofcloth, for example, for peoplemaking it at home, as an addedlayer of protection is a bitlike covering your cough.
I think the special advisorycommittee looked at theliterature around the use ofmasks for this sort of sourcecontrol.
and it's actually mainly frominfluenza studies, and they arenot very clear.
So we want everybody to be awarethat the science is not certain.
But we believe -- we need to doeverything that we can.
It seems a sensible thing to do. So I think we recommend thatcanadians can take thisadditional measure at instanceswhere social distancing isdifficult to maintain.
So our strongest message, really, is that you mustcontinue to do socialdistancing, that two-meterbubble and hand washing, stayhome if you are sick.
All these are effectivemeasures.
This may add a layer ofprotection to prevent you fromtransmitting something to othersbefore you actually know thatyou have the illness.
So I think that needs to be veryclear.
and the other key message, ofcourse, is that medical masksright now, as you've just heard, about the challenges withsupplies, that they must bepreserved for our health workersand others who are looking afterpatients.



Thank you, doctor.
Next question.



Hi, doctor.
I'm with CTV national news.
Over the last couple of days, you have said that peopleshouldn't wear medical masks.
You are asking people to essentially wear nonmedicalmasks now as a way to prevent themselves and others fromspread.
I'm wondering if you could be clearer for Canadians on the guidelines when you saynonmedical masks.
What are you talking about? because now you know hardware stores are closed.
Lots of Canadians at home might be looking to make a homemademask.
So what are you suggesting theywear? what are the guidelines?



We have some suggestions on our web site, but we'll be putting out more additionaltools.
We are talking about things readily available in anyone'shome, things like cotton shirts, sheets, bandanas and othermaterials.
But we're also going to tell people things they shouldn't use as well.
and we have our engineers looking at the evidence onthose.
But I think a simple things that not complicated and preferably no sewing required, because I, for one, can't sew anything.
So if you can get a cotton material like a t-shirt, cut itup, fold it and put elasticbands around it, this nonmedicalfacial coverings that we aretalking about.
and we will see what kind oftools we can provide in shortorder.



I just wanted to ask you afollow-up question on test kits.
Over the last number of days, wehave been asking a lot ofquestions about shortages ofpersonal protective equipmentlike masks, ventilators.
How many test kits do we have incanada at this moment? and can you give us a sense ofhow many test kits we might needshould we see a dramatic numberof cases increase and the numberof people getting sick? like how many test kits do wehave and how many do we needmoving forward?



I think, as I've said, Canada's testing at quite a high rate compared to many othercountries.
and we are pulling out all stops again to improve the capacity incanada.
It's not as simple as just Akita.
Obviously there are, throughout that pipeline of testing, there are swabs, there are otherpieces.
But there are also reagents that people need to use to extract materials from the swab and testit.
So there are many differentcomponents.
Right now, Canada is doing well, but we are trying to make sure we get the right reagents, like all supplies, the global supply chains are very difficult.
So we are looking at how can we look at Canada solutions and also we are at the moment looking at validating things like more rapid test kits, sort of little equipment that can be then sent to, for example, the north or more remote areas thatcan't send their samples to public health lab.
and some of the initiatives that actually changing the testing capacity at the bigger labs into more high machines andprocedures.
So it's not just a matter of counting kits.
So again, efforts are all out on that as well as -- so that'smainly for the detection of the virus through pcr.
and we are also, of course, working on looking at the antibody test.



Thank you, doctor.



I guess I would follow-upwith that.
So why aren't we doing moretesting? is it because of the lack ofresources? or lab supplies or personnel? is that why we are not testing alot of these people who areasymptomatic or presymptomatic?



Yeah, so we have, you know, through our federal provision territorial discussion, guidanceprovided.
So for sure, we want the supplies to be utilized in the most effective way possible.
So that does mean testing in situations where you are most likely to be finding infection and in the most high-risksituations.
So like in outbreak, in clusterdetection, in healthcareworkers, in highly vulnerablecommunities, includingindigenous communities, they'reabsolute musts, and we have todo well.
and long-term care facilities, for example.
For others, we have alreadyprovided instruction that if youare sick, you must stay home.
and others are practicing socialdistancing to the effect thateven if you are presymptomatic, you shouldn't be within thedistance to spread it to otherpeople and with maybe addedprotection like these homemademasks.
So the test doesn't actuallydrive potentially, the publichealth actions.
So you want the tests that youhave and we have, to be onpopulations where you are goingto make a decision after youactually got the test results.
So if you are just staying homeanyway, we are going to beprioritizing others.
We are looking, of course, people very interested intesting, which will help us lookat the level of immunity incertain populations and a littlebit further on in our studies.
and so that's a differentapproach.
But it is one that we arepursuing as well.
But the rate at which we test isquite high.
But it is a bit differentdepending on where you are incanada.
So we want the resources to go to areas, for example, experiencing a higher activityas well.



Okay.
So we are just learning about the asymptomatic, presymptomaticthings.
How are we going to get back to normal without higher levels oftesting? like if people are walking around with this virus thatdon't even know it?



Yes, so obviously when you are walking around, practice social distancing, of course.
and so there's an extremely goodquestion.
and you are going to hear many sort of opinions, if you like, as to how many proportion of your population is asymptomatic and got the infection, which is precisely why we need to dostudies, as time goes on, because right now, our focus is to tackle this actual outbreak.
At some point in the nearfuture, we'll be looking at how do we apply the testing to look at the level of immunity in thepopulation.
and those kind of studies will let us know to what extent the virus has been affecting people in a very mild way or very little symptoms, if at all.
So those do have to be done.
and it has to be also done in the global setting as well.



Thank you.
We'll now turn back to thephone.
Operator?







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Next question from TBA.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Question for the doctor about wearingnon-medical masks.
I didn't hear you say aboutrecommendations.
is it something you arerecommending to Canadians ornot?







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Thank you very much for your question.
To start, I would like to highlight a few key points.
Firstly, about non medical masks.
It's very important to say, it'sabsolutely critical to keep medical masks for people who Arron the front lines, healthcareworkers, namely.
That's one clear point.
Second, another important point, is that even though we are talking about non-medical masks, it's really important to keepphysical distancing measures.
We don't want to give people afalse sense of security, oh, there's I'm wearing a mask, andi don't have to practicephysical distancing or wash myhands.
No, that's not the case.
It's still critical to continuewith proper hygiene and publichealth measures.
Third, if we are talking aboutnon-medical masks, it fits withwhat what was already said, youmay be sick and coughing, youstill always have to cough intoyour elbow.
That's another measure, coughinginto a non-medical mask.
Another important point is thatif you do wear a nonmedicalmask, it's more for protectingothers.
It's not for protecting yourselffrom others.
If you do cough, theserespiratory droplets will betrapped and not contaminateothers who are in front of you.
The special advisory committeeon COVID-19 did reach anagreement.
and all the premiers agreed thatthis is another measure we cantake.
It's something that can help us, but it's not necessarily arecommendation.
It's advice.
Thank you.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Very good.
It's not a recommendation assuch.
Okay, follow-up question foryou.
We are receiving a lot ofe-mails about voluntaryfirefighters who talked to usthis Friday.
What is happening? is it official now thatvolunteer fireworkers willreceive the CERB or not?







**THE INTERPRETER**:

The answer is yes.







**THE INTERPRETER**:

Okay, thankyou.



Okay.
Next question.



Thank you.
Next question is from Christine.
Please go ahead.



Hello, good afternoon.
Thanks again for doing this.
My question pertains to the now confirmed cases, particularly in first nations, that have confirmed cases in recent days.
and I know as a chief public health officer has already said that even one case in indigenous communities has the potential to be devastating.
I'm just wondering, I know the government has already earmarked some funding, $305 million for indigenous community support.
But what is being done in the immediate term to support communities like one in northernontario that doesn't have water and now has this confirmed case of COVID-19?



Thank you, Christi.
I spoke with chief this morning about that particular case up in northwestern Ontario and also will be speaking with chief fiddler later today, sort of in my neck of the woods as northern Ontario member ofparliament.
I will say that according tohim, the person is self isolating.
You're right, it is way more difficult to self isolate and to practice regular hand washing and regular cleansing when you have a situation where there maybe aren't those kinds of facilities or people are in overcrowded situations.
I know My colleague miller has been working carefully with all the first nation leaders around their own pandemic plans of which first nation communitieshave, and is working to make sure they have the resources they need to provide the appropriate medical care and the appropriate follow-up as well asadditional supports of peoplecannot properly self isolate.
I can't speak to this specificcase in terms of where they areat, but I know chief belgarfeels confident that ourgovernment is taking thisseriously and we are there tosupport first nations inensuring they have the measuresthey need when cases areidentified.
I'll turn to Dr. Tam to speakmore about indigenouscommunities.



Yes, we, of course, work with the medical and public health side on the response.
So working with indigenous services Canada.
and our role has been to of course provide guidance in how to manage outbreaks in those kinds of settings.
So we've also issued guidance ts in more remote and rural settings as well.
and those do have to be adapted to the realities of what's on the ground.
and I think we are offering support also for communities where it is difficult to isolatein, for example, crowdedconditions.
So those are some of the measures that we are pursuing.



I'm just wondering, as afollow-up, you mentioned that insome communities, that embracingthe public health advice likephysical distancing and can bevery difficult or more difficultthan in other locations.
I'm wondering, you know, in acommunity where there might bean overcrowding problem, and aperson might have difficultyself-isolating, what optionswould be available or is there aspecific plank looked at topotentially -- plan being lookedat to potentially remove peoplethat don't have the luxury oftrying to figure out where toself-isolate.



Thanks again.
I know that Dr. Wong who is the public health officer with indigenous services Canada has been working with indigenous communities to work on plans for some time.
Certainly there's always an option of providing additional support for alternative living spaces for a whole variety ofcircumstances.
Those have to be balanced carefully with the additional risk that it may pose to indigenous communities, ofcourse, taking people out of their community, a whole host of other challenges that sometimes are equally risky for the particular individual.
So I can't speak to this particular case.
I did understand from my conversation with chief belgarthis person is isolating athome.
But each circumstance will bedifferent.
[please stand by].



Protecting you, it's protecting other people.
If it's not a recommendation, what exactly is it you're saying and why did it take you three weeks to come up with this?



**Answer**:

So, as I said, some of the emerging evidence have only recently been published.
We are incorporating those as we're going along.
Also in the international community, you've seen that different public health experts and different countries around the world are looking intensely at this particular issue, as we have done.
So really as of yesterday with all the chief medical officers of health of the provinces and territories, we are issuing essentially a statement with sort of states that Canadians can wear these coverings or non-medical masks if they can't maintain physical distancing.
So it is a permissive statement and essentially depends on the circumstances, because we want to make sure people are practising the public health measures that have already been recommended and not substitute this.
This is an added layer that someone can take to further prevent the spread of COVID-19.



If I can just add to that --



**Rosemary**:

We're going to leave this federal briefing.
Let me leave you with the highlights.
Public health advice from the health officials say that if you go to somewhere you cannot do physical distancing, you wear a cloth mask and not a medical mask.
It is only advice and not a requirement.
Let's bring you to qu√âbec, the qu√âbec premier, fran√áois legault, giving you an update from his province.
I will leave it there for today.



**Premier Fran√ßois Legault**:

[voice of interpreter] when we look at I. C.u., there are two people less.
That's good news when we look atthe hospitalization rates.
This is encouraging.
Of course it's one day, but whatthat means is if we have a few days like these ones we could say that we're getting closer to the peak and getting back to normal -- closer to getting backto normal life.
But we're not sure.
We can't take any chances.
We can't loosen any of the measures.
We have to continue doing what we are doing correctly, and thatmeans staying at home as much aspossible.
For the equipment, we now have 14 days of gloves, 13 days of n95 masks, 10 days of surgical masks, and six days' worth only of gowns.
So as you can see, our efforts are focused on the gowns right now.
We are looking at the possibility of using washable gowns more that already exist inhospitals.
Of course it would allow us to re-use those gowns.
We're working hard and I talk about it every morning, with qu√âbec companies that are trying to get material out to us. It's going to take a few weeks to get to that.
a word on pregnant women.
We know that right now there's only one hospital that does not allow having someone with women who are coming to give birth, at the Jewish hospital.
So we're having a look at things for women who want to change hospitals so that they are able to change hospitals.
But at the general Jewish hospital there are a lot of cases of COVID-19. So there are good reasons why this rule exists.
But I want to be very clear.
There is no intention on the part of the government of extending these bans to any other hospital.
So I want to reassure all women who are pregnant right now, apart from the Jewish hospital, you will be able to bring your partner with you when you give birth.
Yesterday I talked to you about qu√âbec companies.
This afternoon jean boulet, the Minister of employment and labour, is going to make an announcement of $100 million to those companies that need to do training to their employees.
This is the moment when work in a lot of businesses is on hold.
I think doing training amongst others, all the training on working from home, everything that is digital.
Of course things will be changing a lot in the next few months.
So we are going to pay up to 100% of both wages and expenses which will allow us to prepare ourselves for the reorganization of labour, but also to keep more employees who will continue being paid with their wages.
So I think this is a really nice program and of course training in a knowledge-based economy is very important and will become even more so. My daily thanks are going to be for qu√âbecers as a whole.
We saw yesterday that qu√âbecers are those who have responded thebest in north america to the guidelines.
I think that it's beautiful to see on the one hand people who are not in essential services who stay at home and on the other hand as well it's beautiful to see -- and I get all sorts of testimonies as wellin our hospitals and grocery stores, police officers, even inbanks, you know cashiers -- everybody is doing their job andis getting through this crisis.
I want to tell you that I'm so proud of the qu√âbec people.
I would like to end by repeatingour three priorities and by specifying that if we respect these three guidelines, we are saving lives.
So this is something that is important.
It is not anything that is banal.
If you don't leave your home, ifwhen you do go out, you stay 2 metres or 6' away from other people, and when you come back home, very important to wash your hands with soap.
I count on you all and I feel like saying in April let's not loosen any thread.
Let's keep it all tight.
We hope it's going to be the last difficult month, but the month of April will be critical.
The following days and weeks aregoing to be critical.
We're going to remember this month of April for a long time.
Let's not loosen or slacken things during the month of April.
[end of translation] we may see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we must continue to do everything we can to win the battle against the virus.
We must also prepare the restartof our economy.
Our Minister of labour, jean boulet, later this afternoon will announce a new program thatwill help companies train their employees to new technologies tonew organizations.
I repeat our three priorities toprotect ourselves.
Don't go out unless it's necessary.
If you do go out, keep your distance.
When you come back home, wash your hands.
That's how we'll save lives.
Thank you.



[voice of interpreter] thank you, Mr. Premier.
We will start the question period.

---

**Question**:

My first question for you, Mr. Arruda, you've probably seen a few minutes ago Dr. Tam for health Canada now recommends the wearing of non-medical masks for the population, not to protect oneself, but to make it that people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic PE able to limitthe spread of the virus.
This from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Tam.
What do you think about this?



**Answer**:

I have the same position.
I am the national director of public health of qu√âbec and with my different counterparts.
The difference is today we said it can be -- it's still a draft for inter-provincial purposes.
What I said in the document and I find it really important.
What is proven is to stay home as much as possible.
Having physical distance as we remind people.
Wash your hands.
Protect the most vulnerable frominfection by not visiting them and to cover one's mouth with fabric or a sleeve.
What is important is that procedural masks must remain forhealth workers.
What is indicated here is that in no way does wearing a mask that is homemade replace any other measure.
If people do that, they're not going to be protecting themselves.
The mask that you wear has to bewell-adjusted and washed
