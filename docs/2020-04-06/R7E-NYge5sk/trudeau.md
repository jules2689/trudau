**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau**:

Good morning, everyone.
I want to start by recognizing that today is a painful anniversary.
It has been two years since the tragic Humboldt broncos crash.
From coast to coast to coast, we remember the lives that were ended and those that were changed for ever if you lost a friend, teammate, or a loved one, if you're still rebuilding and recovering, I want you to know that we're here for you and we will always be here for you.
You, the community of Humboldt, along with all Canadians who stand with you, have shown incredible strength and resilience.
Just like the people putting out hockey sticks or wearing the jersey, you remind us that together we can get through the darkest of times.
Right now, as we face a challenge unlike any other, we lean on our friends and family and we let them know that they can lean on us too.
The weeks and months ahead won'tbe easy, but we're going to get through this together.
I'm sure that many of you watched the queen's address yesterday afternoon.
Her message of unity and resolve is more important than ever.
No one should feel alone in this.
No one should wonder how they'llweather this storm without support.
Over the past few weeks, we've brought in a whole range of new measures to help families, workers, seniors, and business owners get through this.
Taken together, we've introduced the biggest economic measures in our lifetime which will help millions of people.
That includes the Canada emergency response benefit for if you've lost your paycheque.
Whether you're taking care of someone who's sick, have been laid off, or are living with a disability, the CERB is there for you.
This benefit is now available starting today.
If you're born in January, February, or March, you can go to Canada.
Ca and apply online.
If you can't apply online, don'tworry.
You can call 1-800-959-2041.
Since it opened this morning, 240, 000 people have already successfully applied.
For everyone else, you'll be able to apply another day this week, depending on your birth month.
We know you need this support as soon as possible.
We have to make sure the system works for everyone.
If you're using direct deposit, you'll receive money three to five days later.
The CERB is meant to help all Canadians who need it and millions of Canadians will be getting it starting this week.
There are some people who don't yet qualify who we do need to help.
If you're working reduced hours, down to 10 hours a week or less, we will soon announce how you will be able to qualify for the CERB.
This is to help you if you're a gig worker, a contract worker, or a volunteer firefighter.
We'll also have more to say to those who are working but are making less than they would with the benefit.
I'm thinking in particular of home care workers or long-term care workers looking after vulnerable seniors.
and I know there are also lots of university or college students wondering what kind of job you'll get this summer.
You need support now and work isunderway to get it to you as soon as possible.
For people in all of these situations, we see you.
We're going to be there for you.
We're working as hard as we can to get you the support you need.
At the same time, we also announced a new 75% wage subsidyto help you keep your job and help businesses keep their employees on the payroll.
Right now we're drafting legislation and talking to otherparties ahead of bringing parliament back to put the wage subsidy in place as quickly as possible, supporting you and your family is our top priority.
Your Minister of finance, bill morneau, will have more updates soon, but here is the bottom line.
Whatever your situation, we are working to get you the help thatyou need.
 

[voice of interpreter] if you were born injanuary, February, or March and you had to stop working because of the virus, you can now apply for the Canada emergency response benefit starting today on Canada.
Ca. If not, you can submit a requestlater in the week depending on your birth month.
Many of you need help quickly and we want to ensure that the system works for everyone.
If you opt for direct deposit, it should take three to five daydays to receive the benefit.
The CERB is for those who need assistance now, but I know thereare some people out there who still need support and are not able to qualify.
If your hours have been reduced to, for example, 10 hours or less, we will soon be announcinghow you can benefit from the CERB.
We will also have news about people earning less money now than they can with the benefit.
I'm thinking, for example, abouthome care workers or those who work in long-term care work.
If you're in cegep or university, you're probably wondering what you will do this summer.
We are working hard on a solution for you.
We are working on legislation and the opposition parties to recall parliament and put in place the measures we have announced as quickly as possible.
The Minister of finance, bill morneau, will provide additionaldetails soon.
But this is what you should remember, whatever your circumstances, we are doing everything we can to help you.
We are working very hard to giveyou some respite and help you manage your financial situation.
The banks have an important roleto play as well because they will be able to help businesses to continue their activities andfamilies to pay their mortgages.
Today I want to thank the six major banks and certain co-operatives for agreeing to reduce by half the interest rates on credit cards for Canadians experiencing financialdifficulty as a result of the pandemic.


[end of translation] major banksand of certain credit unions to cut credit card interest rates almost in half for people in financial difficulty because of the pandemic will give them much-needed relief on debt.
I also want to thank Minister morneau for his outstanding leadership on this.
We need to see even more action like this going forward because this is a time to think about each other, not about the bottomline.
On that note, I want to recognize the new initiative thecanadian chamber of commerce launched in partnership with ourgovernment.
The canadian business resiliencenetwork will help businesses of all sizes get through this tough -- not just get through this tough period, but drive oureconomic recovery afterwards.
This builds on what we've already done to help business owners.
We have a three-point economic plan.
It supports business owners, including through new loans, while safeguarding jobs with thewage subsidy, and helping those who no longer have a paycheque with the CERB.
We're here for you.
In order to get through this andto keep our loved ones and our frontline workers safe, all Canadians need to do their part.
Don't forget that you are shaping our future today.
What the next weeks and months look like, it depends on you andwhether you stay home, whether you help protect the vulnerable and make sure our hospitals aren't overwhelmed.
 

[voice of interpreter] every citizen has to do his part because people who may have to go to work, suchas lab technicians and healthcare workers, truckers, farm workers, are doing more than their share.
They're making sacrifices to allow the rest of the populationto stay home.
The best way to thank them is tocontinue to follow the public health guidelines.
That is how we can all protect our own health and their health as well.
Thank you for being here today.
