### Summary:


Over the past few weeks, we've brought in a whole range of new measures to help families, workers, seniors, and business owners get through this.
Taken together, we've introduced the biggest economic measures in our lifetime which will help millions of people.
We have to make sure the system works for everyone.
The CERB is meant to help all Canadians who need it and millions of Canadians will be getting it starting this week.
There are some people who don't yet qualify who we do need to help.
If you're working reduced hours, down to 10 hours a week or less, we will soon announce how you will be able to qualify for the CERB.
We'll also have more to say to those who are working but are making less than they would with the benefit.
I'm thinking in particular of home care workers or long-term care workers looking after vulnerable seniors.
You need support now and work isunderway to get it to you as soon as possible.
We're working as hard as we can to get you the support you need.
At the same time, we also announced a new 75% wage subsidyto help you keep your job and help businesses keep their employees on the payroll.
Whatever your situation, we are working to get you the help thatyou need.
 

[voice of interpreter] if you were born injanuary, February, or March and you had to stop working because of the virus, you can now apply for the Canada emergency response benefit starting today on Canada.
Many of you need help quickly and we want to ensure that the system works for everyone.
The CERB is for those who need assistance now, but I know thereare some people out there who still need support and are not able to qualify.
If your hours have been reduced to, for example, 10 hours or less, we will soon be announcinghow you can benefit from the CERB.
We will also have news about people earning less money now than they can with the benefit.
I'm thinking, for example, abouthome care workers or those who work in long-term care work.
We are working hard on a solution for you.
We are working on legislation and the opposition parties to recall parliament and put in place the measures we have announced as quickly as possible.
We are working very hard to giveyou some respite and help you manage your financial situation.
The banks have an important roleto play as well because they will be able to help businesses to continue their activities andfamilies to pay their mortgages.
Today I want to thank the six major banks and certain co-operatives for agreeing to reduce by half the interest rates on credit cards for Canadians experiencing financialdifficulty as a result of the pandemic.


[end of translation] major banksand of certain credit unions to cut credit card interest rates almost in half for people in financial difficulty because of the pandemic will give them much-needed relief on debt.
The canadian business resiliencenetwork will help businesses of all sizes get through this tough -- not just get through this tough period, but drive oureconomic recovery afterwards.
This builds on what we've already done to help business owners.
It supports business owners, including through new loans, while safeguarding jobs with thewage subsidy, and helping those who no longer have a paycheque with the CERB.
In order to get through this andto keep our loved ones and our frontline workers safe, all Canadians need to do their part.
What the next weeks and months look like, it depends on you andwhether you stay home, whether you help protect the vulnerable and make sure our hospitals aren't overwhelmed.
 

[voice of interpreter] every citizen has to do his part because people who may have to go to work, suchas lab technicians and healthcare workers, truckers, farm workers, are doing more than their share.
