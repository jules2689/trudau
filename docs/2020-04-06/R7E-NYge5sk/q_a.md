**Question**:

Premier ford in Ontario reportedly told the news that Ontario could run out of personal protective equipment within a week and that the United States has stopped a shipment of equipment last night.
I wonder what your reaction to that is of that impending shortage in Ontario.
Can you tell us if the United States has stopped any shipments of goods into Canada?



**Answer**:

We are working closely with all provinces and monitoring the levels of personal protective equipment and the challenges they're facing both on procurement and on making sure that our healthcare workers across the country get the help they need.
We continue to have productive and positive conversations with the United States, emphasizing for them that healthcare supplies and workers across the border are very much a two-way street and we need to continue to be there for our neighbours because it's in our collective interest.
Minister champagne had a productive conversation with Mr. Pompeo this morning and we expect those supplies to be delivered.
 [voice of interpreter] from the outset, wehave been working with the premiers of the provinces to ensure that they have enough medical equipment to protect their healthcare workers.
We're very much aware of the concerns in terms of there not being enough equipment in the coming days.
That's why we are working very, very hard to secure those supplies around the world and also start to produce them here in Canada.
I can say that we continue to have very productive discussionswith the americans.
Minister champagne spoke to secretary pompeo this morning.
We are expecting those products to be delivered.

**Question**:

Have you -- I guess just to repeat that question, has there been any shipments that have been stopped that we were expecting to get? and have you received any assurances from the Americans that they will allow these to gothrough?



**Answer**:

As I said, there are very productive conversations ongoing and we expect those shipments to be delivered.



Thank you.
Next question.



Next question Jim bronscale, "the Canadian press." the line is open.

**Question**:

Good morning.
We're wondering if you can update us on any of the efforts to ensure that people are quarantined who need to be quarantined.
Do you have anything to tell us today about whether anyone has been quarantined? if so, are there any numbers on that score? thank you.



**Answer**:

Anyone returning to Canada is subject to a mandatory quarantine order.
That means they have to go straight home from the airport and stay home for 14 days.
Public health officials are following up with a number of those people, particularly some of the higher-risk or challenging cases.
We are confident that Canadians right across the country are obeying the quarantine orders and making sure they're doing everything they need to to keep their loved ones and themselves safe.



Follow-up question.

---

**Question**:

is there any sense beyond the normal quarantine procedures whether the quarantine act has been invoked in special cases and people have actually been forced into quarantine in centres or other locations under the quarantine act?



**Answer**:

From the very beginning there was a number of measures that we took on returning flights from Wuhan, for example, on flights comes back from various cruises, where we had mandatory quarantines in centres.
We have facilities available for people who are returning to Canada and for various reasons cannot quarantine themselves at home or home is too far from theairport.
That is why we have institutions in place and those are being used.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] good morning, Prime Minister.
About a week ago you were talking about the end of your isolation arriving.
Can you tell us when that will happen?



**Answer**:

Well, I intend to return to the office in the coming days, but My work will continue for the time being at home.
We know that that's what we're asking everyone to do. We're telling people to stay home as much as possible.
As we've seen in recent weeks, it is possible to do so and we're working very well from home in this particular circumstance.
Yes, I may have to go back to parliament or go to the office at some point in the coming days or weeks, but I will continue to work from home as much as possible.

---

**Question**:

You also mentioned in your statement that the coming weeks and months will not be easy.
Could you elaborate on that? I understand the curve depends on the choices people are making and you will be releasing information, but in concrete terms what does this mean?



**Answer**:

Well, it means people should expect to continue to stay home.
This is for many weeks and perhaps many months.
We will have more specific answers for people once we have completed our modelling, and that will give people a better idea of what could happen.
But every model and every projection shows a lot of variability depending on the actions we take as individuals and as a society.
Staying home and continuing to be isolated and practice distancing is the best way to come out of this as quickly as possible.
But this will be an issue that lasts for weeks and possibly months.

**Question**:

Good morning, Mr. Trudeau.
I'd like to hear you comment on parliament.
Work has been suspended in parliament for three weeks, and that means the democratic process is not really underway and yet you're a minority government.
So what do you say to people who say you're getting around the opposition parties and governing all by yourself?



**Answer**:

On the contrary.
That is exactly why we're recalling parliament to develop very important legislation that will help workers and businesses with the wage subsidy.
I'm looking forward to being in parliament and seeing it recalled in reduced numbers so that we can continue to do our important work as parliamentarians.
At the same time, it's important to say that there are many parliamentarians right across the country who were elected to represent their communities that simply cannot come to parliament at this time.
That is why we are looking at --looking very seriously at ways to bring parliament together virtually.
We know that it's important to allow our democracy to continue to fully operate.
We want to give an opportunity to all M.P.s, not just those wholive close to parliament, to represent their citizens.
We will continue to work on thatin the coming days and weeks.

---

**Question**:

About the idea of virtual parliament, what kind of model are you looking at? would you be prepared every single day for question period or would it be something more flexible since we're in a crisis?



**Answer**:

Well, I think there are a lot of good ideas we are hearing in terms of how we can make our processes and our institutions more robust in thiscrisis.
and I think that it's even more important now that we have a strong democracy and strong institutions when dealing with acrisis.
That's why we're working with the other parties and our institution's party experts in order to continue to give confidence to the people of Canada, that our democracy is working, that parliament is working, and that we remain strong even in these difficult times.
[end of translation] it is really important that we continue to strengthen our democracy even during a crisis -- especially during a crisis.
That's why I'm looking forward to seeing parliament reconvene in a reduced state in the coming days to be able to pass important legislation that's going to get wage subsidies out to employers so people can continue to hold their jobs, even in this time where very few people are working.
More than that, we have to look at ways of virtually convening parliament so that parliamentarians from across the country who were elected to do their jobs representing their citizens in normal times and in times of crisis, can make themselves heard.
It can't just be folks who have proximity to parliament or the ability to get here.
We need to look at ways our institutions can stay strong and embody and fulfil the functions that Canadians need them to. That's why I'm very much looking forward to discussions with other parties and experts on how we can continue with our institutions even in this difficult time.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] now, the Canada emergency response benefit, there are a lot of people who are falling through the cracks at this time and they are wondering what they can do and how long they will last.
What kind of changes will you make to fill in those gaps and will it be retroactive?



**Answer**:

Well, we are currently looking at a couple of different type of people who are falling through the cracks and are not eligible for that benefit.
We have seen people with massively reduced hours but who are continuing to work and who should be able to access the CERB.
Some people may be working only 10 hours a week and are earning only $500 a month.
We believe they should have access to the CERB.
So in the coming days we will be announcing how those people can apply to receive the Canada emergency response benefit.
We also realize that in some areas, for example, in long-termcare facilities, there are workers who are earning less permonth.
They're carrying out very important work for society, but they're earning less than they would receive under the CERB, the new benefit.
So we want to ensure that those people who are doing this important work can continue to do it and we're looking at how we can give them more money so they can keep those jobs and continue to do that work.
We will have more to say in the coming days.
[end of translation] the Canada emergency response benefit is there to help millions of Canadians.
We've moved quickly on it to tryto help as many people as we possibly can as quickly as possible.
That's rolling out today.
At the same time, we recognize there are groups of people that aren't benefitting from the Canada emergency response benefit who probably should.
I think specifically of people who have seen their hours reduced massively down to 10 hours a week or less, maybe making a total of $500 a month who are in a precarious situation, who really should andcould benefit from the Canada emergency response benefit.
So we're going to be announcing in the coming days how people inthat situation will be able to apply and receive the Canada emergency response benefit.
Think of other people, perhaps people working in long-term carefacilities or seniors' residences who do extremely important work, particularly these days, but they don't make as much per month as they would if they lost their job and were receiving the response benefit.
That's why we're looking carefully at how we can increasetheir pay a little bit so they do better off remaining at work rather than receiving -- going off work and receiving the emergency response benefit.
These are fine-tunings that we knew we would have to do becausein any program you're trying to help as many people as possible, there will be exceptions they have to fill.
We will keep working to make sure we get this right and get everyone the help they need.

**Question**:

[voice of interpreter] now, with respect to the s. M.e. S and economic growth, the economic growth expected in the second quarter will, in fact, be a decline in growth.
Now, the fact is that the wage subsidy does not suit all businesses.
What can you do about that and what can you do to stop the steady decline in the economy?



**Answer**:

Well, we're in a situation right now where what we have to do to deal with the health crisis is harming the economy and creating an economic crisis as well.
But we have choices to make.
We have no choice but to shut down the economy in order to come through this crisis as soon as possible, so that we can get those economic engines up and running again as quickly as possible in a few months.
and in order to get through these difficult months, we are providing assistance directly to workers and businesses so that they can last out this crisis with the wage subsidy, with loans and access to credit, with funding for large corporations as well.
So we are there to ensure that when the economy rebounds at the end of this crisis, we will be in a good economic position and will be able to get the economic activity up and running again.

**Question**:

I just want to return back to that city news report about the shipment of masks.
Did the United States block that shipment of masks to Canada? are you aware of any other shipments that have been delayed or blocked? you said you expect the shipment to arrive.
If it doesn't, what will you do?



**Answer**:

We continue to have productive and constructive conversations with officials in the American administration who understand that essential services and supplies are very much a two-way street between Canada and the United States.
We are interconnected and interlinked in so many ways fromthe primary resources flowing toamerican companies to make the equipment that is so desperatelyneeded in north america and around the world with shipments that go from Canada to the United States and from the United States to Canada.
We're going to continue to work together.
We're going to make sure that goods and services that are essential continue to flow and iexpect those shipments to come in soon.
 [voice of interpreter] we know that essential goods and services cross the border in both directions.
We will continue to work with the americans to ensure that those essential products to protect Canadians come to canadaand we are confident they will.

**Question**:

The centres for disease controls is recommended people wear masks when they go out.
Canada hasn't gone that far.
Why has Canada not made that recommendation when some healthcare experts say it's a good idea?



**Answer**:

I'm not going to make healthcare recommendations to people.
I don't think politicians should be opining on healthcare fixes or solutions.
I know Dr. Tam is going to be sharing new reflections on be masks in less than an hour now and I encourage people to continue to listen to her and to health experts and professional son how best we can keep ourselves safe, our loved ones safe, how best we can keep our healthcare workers safe at this time.

**Question**:

Prime Minister, some of the countries that have had the most success flattening the curve, such as Germany, attribute that to testing.
Why is it we're not doing more testing, is it lack of people to administer the testing, or lack of testing kits?



**Answer**:

Every single day we're doing more than before.
We realize that large-scale testing is a key element of flattening the curve and dealingwith the long-term prognosis of this pandemic.
We will need to continue to testmore and more, to get those answers back quickly, and to be able to monitor the spread of coronavirus through our population.
That's why we're continuing to do more tests.
That's why we're creating more test kits.
That's why we're continuing to develop new solutions on testing.
Testing will be an essential part of how we get through this.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that testing is essential when it comes to our ability to get through this pandemic.
That is why every single day we are doing more testing and why we are securing new test kits, alarger number of kits, so testing can be done more quicklybecause we know that getting through this means massive testing.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

When will the testing kits be delivered to the provinces so testing can be ramp ed up? is.



**Answer**:

We have had a delivery of testing kits and we will continue to deliver those.
We know there is a need for mo retesting kits and that is what we're working on.

**Question**:

We're hearing that healthcare professionals, nurses, doctors are being told by hospitals on border towns, specifically Windsor and SALT st. Marie, that they have to choose where they are going to work.
Will that reduce the amount of cross-border contamination working on both sides of the border?



**Answer**:

Border mayors are making difficult decisions and are choosing to do things to protect our citizens and neighbours.
We are going to get the balance right and it is going to require some difficult choices.
An essential path forward is not just keeping Canadians safe which needs to be a top priority, but also helping the world deal with this global crisis and that's what everyone is trying to do.  [voice of interpreter] we realize that our premiers and mayors right across the country, and particularly in cities on the border, are facing very difficult decisions and their primary responsibility is to ensure the health and safety of Canadians.
At the same time, we resides that we are facing a global situation and we have to be there to help our neighbours if we can.
[end of translation].

---

**Question**:

I didn't get an answer to that question specifically.
But I need to move on because there is another answer we're looking for.
From this report that premier ford is talking about with this shipment that was blocked yesterday, are you aware of shipments of personal protective equipment for protecting medical personnel or any other shipment that has been blocked by the United States?



**Answer**:

We have recognized over the past weeks a number of situations in which shipments coming from different countries around the world have been delayed, haven't arrived with as many products as we were hoping to see.
This continues to be an ongoing problem.
Specifically with the United States, we are working with them to ensure that the orders that Canada has placed get delivered.
We expect those shipments to come.
 [voice of interpreter] we recognize that that is a reality around the globe, that some shipments are coming with less equipment than we wanted or were delayed because of the actions taken by various countries.
We will continue to work to ensure that Canada receives everything that it needs.
